# TLG Publishing Workflow - Python Tools Documentation

This document catalogs the Python tools developed for the TLG publishing workflow, specifically for preparing books for layout by converting documents from various formats to clean, editable Markdown.

## Overview

The TLG publishing workflow involves converting books from PDF → DOCX → Markdown, then cleaning and preparing the Markdown for InDesign layout. These Python tools help automate detection and fixing of common conversion artifacts.

## Recommended Cleanup Workflow

For optimal results when preparing books for layout, follow this sequence:

### Phase 1: Initial Conversion
1. **Convert**: PDF → DOCX (using Pandoc or similar)
2. **Convert**: DOCX → Markdown (using Pandoc)
3. **Extract**: Images separately (if needed for layout)

### Phase 2: Automated Cleanup (Run in this order)
1. **`image_reference_remover.py`** - Remove all image references from the Markdown
2. **`blockquote_remover.py`** - Remove inappropriate blockquotes created during conversion
3. **`advanced_break_fixer.py`** - Fix paragraph breaks, sentence splits, and hyphenated words
4. **`markdown_header_fixer.py`** - Fix header hierarchy and remove header/footer artifacts
5. **`markdown_header_depth_corrector.py`** - Correct excessive header depth (limit to H4 max)
6. **`long_line_detector.py`** - Break up overly long paragraphs
7. **`markdown_cleanup_fixer.py`** - Final cleanup of punctuation and conjunction issues

### Phase 3: Quality Control
1. **`paragraph_break_detector.py`** - Scan for any remaining artifacts
2. **Manual Review** - Address any complex issues flagged by the detector
3. **Final Validation** - Spot-check critical sections

### Phase 4: Layout Preparation
- Clean Markdown ready for InDesign import
- Structured content with proper headers and formatting
- All conversion artifacts removed

**Time Investment**: ~30 minutes of automated processing vs. 4-6 hours of manual cleanup

- **Batch Processing Ready**: Can be easily integrated into automated workflows
- **Non-destructive Preview**: Test changes before applying them
- **Production Ready**: Robust error handling and validation

**Integration with Workflow**:
This tool should be run as part of the standard cleanup process after Pandoc conversion:
1. Convert DOCX → Markdown with Pandoc
2. Run `image_reference_remover.py` to clean up image references
3. Run other cleanup tools (blockquote removal, paragraph break fixing, etc.)

**Example Removals**:
```
Line 373: ![](./images/media/image3.png)

### 4. `fix_paragraph_breaks.py` (Legacy)
**Purpose**: Early version of paragraph break detection (superseded by `paragraph_break_detector.py`).

**What it does**:
- Basic paragraph break artifact detection
- Simple pattern matching for common issues
- Direct file processing

**Status**: **DEPRECATED** - Use `paragraph_break_detector.py` instead

**Note**: This was an iterative development that led to the more comprehensive `paragraph_break_detector.py` tool.

---

### 5. Long Line Detector and Fixer (`long_line_detector.py`)

**Purpose**: Detects and automatically fixes overly long lines in Markdown documents by breaking them into readable paragraphs at natural sentence boundaries.

**Created**: August 7, 2025 (Version 1.0)

**Key Features**:
- Detects lines exceeding configurable length thresholds (default: 150 characters)
- Finds natural break points at sentence endings, clause breaks, and em-dashes
- Preserves Markdown formatting (blockquotes, headers, code blocks, tables)
- Provides severity classification (minor, moderate, severe)
- Offers dry-run mode for safe preview
- Generates detailed reports with line numbers and break suggestions
- Supports automatic fixing with backup and rollback capabilities

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
# Analyze document for long lines
python3 long_line_detector.py document.md --threshold 150 --report report.md

# Preview proposed changes (dry run)
python3 long_line_detector.py document.md --dry-run

# Apply automatic fixes
python3 long_line_detector.py document.md --fix --output fixed-document.md

# Custom threshold and ignore certain elements
python3 long_line_detector.py document.md --threshold 200 --ignore-headers --ignore-code
```

**Algorithm Details**:
- Uses regex patterns to identify sentence endings (`[.!?]\s+[A-Z]`)
- Detects clause breaks with conjunctions (`[,;]\s+(?:and|but|or|however|...)`)
- Finds em-dash breaks (`---?\s+`)
- Falls back to word boundaries if no natural breaks found
- Preserves blockquote prefixes (`>`) when breaking quoted text
- Maintains proper paragraph spacing with double newlines

**Real-World Impact**:
- **Yggsburgh Project**: Detected 2,536 long line issues across 13,419 lines
  - 1,439 severe issues (>300 characters)
  - 544 moderate issues (225-300 characters) 
  - 553 minor issues (150-225 characters)
- **Estimated Fix**: Would create ~7,500 new paragraph breaks for improved readability
- **Time Savings**: Eliminates hours of manual paragraph reformatting

**Integration**: Works seamlessly with other TLG tools for comprehensive document cleanup workflow.

- **Preserves Meaning**: Maintains visual emphasis while fixing document structure
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed analysis and transformation log

**Usage:**
```bash
# Process document with automatic versioning (creates document_header_corrected_v1.md)
python3 markdown_header_depth_corrector.py document.md

# Specify custom output file (no versioning)
python3 markdown_header_depth_corrector.py input.md output.md

# Use custom max depth (e.g., H3)
python3 markdown_header_depth_corrector.py document.md --max-depth 3

# Disable automatic hierarchy correction
python3 markdown_header_depth_corrector.py document.md --no-fix-hierarchy
```

**Key Features:**

Output: ## Section  
        ### Skipped Level (corrected to H3)
```

**Real-World Results** (Yggsburgh project):
- **894 total headers** analyzed
- **643 headers corrected** (H5-H8 → bold text)
- **38 hierarchy corrections** made automatically
- **0 hierarchy issues** remaining after processing
- **Processing time**: < 5 seconds for 900-page document

**Report Output:**

## Workflow Integration

### VS Code Tasks
Several tools are integrated with VS Code tasks for seamless workflow:

```json
{
    "label": "Format Selection as Markdown Table",
    "type": "shell",
    "command": "echo \"${selectedText}\" | python3 \"${workspaceFolder}/book_parser.py\" --format md"
}
```

### Command Line Workflow
Typical workflow for book preparation:

1. **Convert document**: `pandoc document.docx -o document.md --extract-media=./images --wrap=none`
2. **Clean images**: `sed 's/!\[.*\](.*)//' document.md > document-clean.md`
3. **Remove anchors**: `sed 's/\[\]{[^}]*}//g' document-clean.md > document-final.md`
4. **Detect artifacts**: `python3 paragraph_break_detector.py document-final.md`
5. **Fix issues**: Manual fixes based on detector output

## Common Patterns Detected

### Paragraph Break Artifacts
The enhanced detector identifies these conversion issues:

**Basic Patterns**:
- **Conjunction endings**: Lines ending with "and", "or", "but", etc.
- **Preposition endings**: Lines ending with "of", "in", "at", "on", etc.
- **Article endings**: Lines ending with "a", "an", "the"
- **Determiner endings**: Lines ending with "this", "that", "some", "each", etc.

**Advanced Patterns** ⭐ **NEW**:
- **Incomplete verbs**: Lines ending with "wears", "takes", "follows", "is", "are", etc.
- **Cross-blockquote breaks**: Sentences split across `>` blockquote boundaries
- **Relative clause breaks**: "who", "which", "that" constructions interrupted
- **Verb-object separation**: Action verbs separated from their objects

**Comma and Continuation Issues**:
- **Comma breaks**: Comma at line end followed by short next line
- **Orphaned words**: Single words that should be joined to previous line
- **Continuation starts**: Lines starting with "however", "therefore", etc.

### Example Issues Found:
```
📌 ENDS WITH INCOMPLETE ACTION VERB 'WEARS': (1 issues)
Line 379: Ends with incomplete action verb 'wears' - 
> The exception to the following is the military man who wears

📌 VERB-OBJECT PHRASE BROKEN ACROSS BLOCKQUOTE: (2 issues)
