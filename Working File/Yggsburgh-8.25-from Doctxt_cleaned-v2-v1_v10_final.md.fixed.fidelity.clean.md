Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

## Foreword

†

ONCE UPON A TIME therewasa Mad Archmage whose castleand dungeons became synonymons with adventuring. That place remains today. Onlythe names have changedto protectthe concerned partiesfor this publication. youare holding this productnow, asitisa partofthe changes necessary. In orderto presentthe "abandoned" castleandits many dungeon levels, an area surronndingthe place needstobe detailed. you haveit! Note though that this base areais completelynew, in orderto facilitatethe later additionoftheold castleand dungeon materialin revised form. Donot wonderwhyyou never reador heard about Yggsburgh, andthe other persons, places, and thingsinand aroundit. Theyare recent creationsof mineand done withallofthe spiritofthe original work.

Asyou perusethe contentsof this work, you will findall mannerof adventure areas, eventhe locationof Castle Zagyg. Unlike other places, though, thatone locale, the castleandits dungeon levels, hasno special Encountersor details. Why? because that partis massive. Thereare many floorsofthe fortificationand even more underground maze levelsyettobe done. What? Aren't those places already completed?! Afterall, scores, hundredsin fact, of playershad their characters adventurein theminthe past. Well, that assumptionis correct, butasany Castle Keeper knows, material created thatis ampleforhisown purposesisnotatall suitablefor commercial presentationina module. A careful revisionofthe existing level mapsand their brief notesis necessary. Thatis, of course, a monumental undertaking consideringthe projected sizeofthe whole work. Thereare detailsofall Encounters, cross- connections between many dungeon levels, and overall text descriptionsto explain everything presented. So that'sfor later. A seriesof modulesare also plannedforthe expansionof this base.

Rightnow whatyou havein handisthe environsofthe Castle Zagyg complex. Itisa complete playing module, a campaign setting unto itself. The areais large, so that characterscan adventureinit sansthe castle proper. To ensure this, the descriptionsof many placesare loaded with adventure hooks. The walled townfor whichthe moduleis named, Yggsburgh, providesnot only current playing opportunities, butitandits suburban areatoo, are meantto later serveasthe base from which characterscan operatein their dungeon delving. you will note thatthe greater communityhasall thatis neededto supplyand assistthe adventuring team. Itis developed witha history, economy, political structure, socio- economic information, anda detailed monetary system. Thereare also, as previously stated, many other areasonthemap likewise ripefor derring-do, many detailed, some others purposefully left mainlyforthe able handsofthe Castle Keeperto develop. A module wonldn'tbe complete, though, withoutafew dungeon- like areas, and thisisa complete work. Soyou will find several herein. Checkontthe subterranean area maps!

Enongh preliminary exposition. Letus moveonto that whichis hereandnow, Yggsburghand environs. Enjoythe storyandthe action that followsandbe sureto pickupthe next installmentof Castle Zagyg, The Dark Chateau, by Rob Kuntz. Gary Gygax ## Notesforthe Castle Keeper

†

This settingis recommendedfortwo setsof charactersper person. The ones initially adventuringin this module should beginatlowmid-level, 4thto 6th. These characterscanbe createdonthe spotor else drawn fromthe players' existing onesof that level spread. The adventuresinand aroundthe town callfor such advanced ability... and more! Several levels shouldbe gainedinthe action presented herein. When play movestothe actual castleandits many dungeon levels, each player should then generateanew characterof 1st level. These characterscanbe relatives, friends, or henchmenofthe higher-level ones used initially. Withnew charactersof beginning level, the proper spiritofthe original dungeons willbe capturedand enjoyed. When they delvetothe depthsofthe Castle Zagyg dungeons, they willbe adventurersof considerable power.

When dealing with Encounters (whether randomor thoseset forth herein), feel freeto adjustthe difficulty levelforthe party. Ifthe charactersare relativelylow-level, reducethe numberand strengthof their oppositionto makethe match more even. Wherethe adventurersareof high level, add more powerto their opponentsand increase their number without hesitation. For example, ifthe foesare 1hit dice humanoids, adda stronger "associate" monster, make someofthe humanoids tongher, perhaps 2or morehit dice. Do justthe same with humansand demi-humansby adding levels. Putas many additional opponents, hit diceor levelsto createas much forceasis neededto givethe partya severe test. Makeita real challengeto them.

Be sureto familiarize yourself withthe layontand contentsof this book, thoughnot necessairlythe details. The Castle Keeper should know wheretogotogetthe information theyare after. Part Iof Yggsburghisa historicaland cultural overviewofthe setting. Part II details manyofthe places withinthe free townof Yggsburgh while Part III detailsthe environs about Yggsburgh. The appendicesarea wealthof informationforthe Castle Keepersobe sureto examine themas they containthe Ordersof Battle, Encounter chartsandnew monsters, to mentionafew things.

Within, some Encounter areas havenon-player character stat blocks thatare missing. Theseare locatedin Appendix I, Ordersof Battle, as thesenon-player characters havea tendancyto cropupin many placesandin orderto offer easy accessstothe stats they were placed togetherinone appendix. Further, withinthe stat blocks, HDishit dice, ACis armor class, Prime Attributesis prime attribute, SKis secondary skilland Equipmentis equipment. The remainder shouldbe self-explanatory.

Thereis alsoa "Zagyg Adventure Reference" entry located with many area descriptions. This simply kists associated adventures, peoplesand placesand suppliesa ready referencefor Castle Keepersto allow themto make associations between places, peoples, and even events. Thereare varying levelsof detail here reflectingthe importanceor significanceofthe Encounter.

Finally, thereareno roguesin Yggsburgh. Thereare just thieves. Forall intentsand purposes, the thiefin this volumeis likethe roguefor Castles & Crusades, only more nefarionsandnotatadbit evil.

Thereis also much room leftfor developing Yggsburghtofit your needsasa Castle Keeper. Please examine Appendix A, Developing Yggsburghfor more details.

## Backgroundand Overview

†

The Free Townof Yggsburghisa heavily fortified communityof some 22,000 residents, with another 10,000orso persons dwellingonthe landsit claimsasitsown. The townis constructedonthe rock bluff wherethe River Nemois joinedbythe Urt River. The area encompassedbythe community's wallsis aboutone square mile. becauseofthe bluff Yggsburghis built upon, its buildings climb froma street levelof about 10 feet abovethe surrounding plainonthe east edgeto fully 40 feet above that plainatthe westernendofthe town whereits great citadel stands. Thus, one approaching fromthe eastcanseethe place well, the inclineofthe bluff seemingto tiltthe westernendof Yggsburgh upwardsforthe viewer's inspection. The wallsare built atopthe solid rockofthe bluff, the sidesofthe natural formation shelvedatthe waters' edges, then splayedtoan upwards distanceof about 10 feet, thereafter rising precipitonslyin near perpendicular facetothetop. The town wallsareset backan averageof 20 feet fromthe edgeofthe bluff, butthe many towersand bastions between them alongits lengthare very neartherim, and have onlya narrow pathof some threeto four feet around their verge.

Asone comes nearertothe fortifications, itcanbe seen that therearewar engines, scorpionsand catapultsonthe gatehonseand tower roofs. A careful survey revealsa massive citadelatthe westendofthe town, it havingtwo regular towersanda greatone looming abovethe confluenceofthe Nemoand Urt Rivers. The thick town walls spront 36 defensive towersby your count, not includingthe pair that flanks eachofthe three gatehonsesby whichthe place mightbe entered. The wall towersareset with about 500 feet distance between each. Atthe intervals between themare semi-circular wall bastions that thrust ontwards fromthe walls, asdothe towers. On eachof these 36 bastionsyoucanseea pairof scorpionsanda catapult. One thingis certain: if Yggsburghhasa strong military garrison, this towncanbe defended againsta massive attacking force.

Townbridge, the main approachtothe walled community, isatits sontheastern side. The bridgeis somethingofa remarkable architectural achievement, asisthe canal that servesasa moatonits eastern side. The townis well-knownasan active trading center. In additiontothe salt, gold, gemsand jewelry, Yggsburgh's industries export quantitiesof flour, driedand salt fish, fine wood, furs, cloth, metal ware suchas toolsand cooking ware, and much good pottery. Its most famons buildingsarethe Grand Temple, its Citadel, the college complex, andthe Mayor's Palace.

The townis particularly prondofits waterand sewer systems, andits relatively straight, wide, and very clean streets. Inthe better districts, buildings have indoor plumbingand central heat, the streets lighted after dark. Yggsburgh also boaststwo modest little parks, as wellastwo largeand three small plazas, the latter just insidethe three town gates. Most visitors remarkonthe fact thatallofthe buildingsinthe townare constructedof stone block, bricks, ora combinationofthetwo. The newer structuresinthe eastern halfofthe townare mostlyof brickandnot particularly lovely, butnot proneto fire evenin crowded lower-class sections.

The townis ruledbya Lord Mayoranda Councilof eight importantmen. The Lord Mayor appoints officialstoseetothe administrationofthe community. A fair numberof knightsare vassaltothe Lord Mayor, and withthe regular military force employedby Yggsburgh, itis considereda strongand safe havenfor honest folks. Thusthe territory immediately aroundthe townis prosperous, relatively quietand freeof raidersand bandits, so riverand road commerceis active. That said, notalotof questionsare askedof strangers, andas longas locallawis obeyed, "foreigners" are welcomein Yggsburgh. Ithasa large suburban areatothe east, acrossthe Yggsburgh Canal, this being called "The Outs." The populationis modest, 4,000orso, butall thereare quite withoutthe stricturesofthe town. The placeisn't lawless, forthe townlaw applies, but mostofthe time thereisno town authority theretoseetoit thatthelawis obeyed.

The regionisbyno means idyllic, as thereare three palatine nobles within threeor fourday's marchof Yggsburgh, eachof whom covetsthe townandits rich landsand would liketoadd themtohisown demesne. Spiesand agents provocateurarenot uncommonin Yggsburgh, and thickin The Outs. The outlying areasare generally wild frontier, with banditsand humanoid raidersa menace, and dangerous creatures prowling.

Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

## History

†

The walled townof Yggsburghis about 300 yearsold, butup until around 100 yearsagoitwasno more thana large trading village withlow wallsandalotof river traffic stoppingatitto gainits saltand agricultural produce. When goldand valuable garnetand quartz gems were discoveredin whatisnow knownasthe Glittering Knobsa centuryago, therewasan immediate dispute amongst three nobles whose lands were adjacenttothe area- Huon (Baron Redfort), Delkart (Count Easmoor), and Edmund (Marquis Talworth). As therewasno strong monarch ruling them, the dispute betweenthe nobles soon broke into open warfare.

When Marquis Talworth managedto capturethe area, hesethis architectand engineersto work immediately. Soon Yggsburghwas aswarm with masons, other craftsmen, and laborers intenton building wallsand towers aroundthe burgeoning village. Withtheaidof various mages, the whole construction (includinga considerable canal betweenthe Urtand Nemo Rivers, servingas botha transport arteryand vast moatforthenew town) was accomplishedina mere five years. Costs were financedbythe salt mineinthe Serpent Ridge, and withoreand gems being mined fromthe Glittering Knobs.

Neitherof Talworth's rivalswas satisfied withthe ontcome, so Baron Redfortand Count Easmoor made common canse. Thus allied, their forcesmetand defeated thoseofthe Marquisin whatis known locallyasthe Battleofthe Westfields. However, their victorydidnot bringthe desired result. A local petty noble, Edward, Lord Yggs (to whomthe villageand salt minehad belonged), witha handfulof knights, cut downthe foreign garrison, closedthe gatesand defiedthe would-be conquerors. becausethe local populace were heartilyfedup with heavy- handed ruleand ruinous taxes, thoseinthe communityas wellas those fromthe lands around flockedtothe townin armsand swore vassalageto Lord Yggs, promisingto defendit, himandhis lands. Evenso, there were scarcely enough warriorstomanallthe wallsand towers properly. The massed forcesof Baron Redfortand Count Easmoor laid siegeto Yggsburgh.

Things looked grimfor Lord Yggs, asthe investing army managedtoget acrossthe canalandthe Urt River, establish bridgeheads nearthe town walls, and attack boththe Moatgateandthe Rivergateby siege engineand magical spell. althoughno spell- castersof note were withinthe walls, the attackers were driven backby great dweomers. Some unknown wizardhad cometo Yggsburgh, usedhis powerto counterthe assailants' magic, and usedhisown spellsto rain destructiononthe enemy. Having suffered great losses thus, thetwo nobles abandonedthe field.

Soit cameto pass thatthe townwas ruledby Lord Yggsfor some 20 years, and underhis guiding handit grewand became wealthy from tradeand manufacture, as wellas exploitationof nearby mineral resources. Asit prospered, he causeda great templetobe builtin thanksforthe deliverance, andthe flourishing conditionof townand lands around. When Lord Yggs died childless, his officersand knights were astonishedatthe contentsofhis will. Lewis Garmonde (Lord Yggs) commanded thathis estatesbe keptas theirownby those holdingthe lands, and thatthe town becomea freeone, the nobles owing vassalagetothe communityat largeandits Lord Mayor. His will decreed thata Councilof eight greatmenofthe community serveto make laws, and electfora periodof 10 yearsone other likeman (whowasnota Council member) to serveas Lord Mayorand administerthe town. At leastsix Council membershadto agreetotheonetobe chosenas Lord Mayor. The Lord Mayorwastoseetothe maintenance, policingand securityof Yggsburgh, enforcethe Council's laws, and levy taxes approvedbythe Council.

The eight membersofthe Councilhad been namedbythe dying lordas: the chief priestofthe grand templeto serveas president, the mastersofthetwo largest town guilds, its wealthiest bankerasits treasurer, the most able mageinthe town, the presidentof Yggsburgh Collegeasits secretary, andtwo knightswho dwelledinthe townand heldthe largest estates adjacentto town- held land.

Of conrsethe citizensofthe townandits surrounding lands were overjoyedat this bequest. Notallofthe officersand knightsofthe deceased lord wereso pleased, though. Therewas much mutteringand clandestine meetings amongstthetwo dozenorso highly influential personsin Yggsburgh, butall cameto naughtin regardsto declarationof Lord Lewis Garmonde's Last Will & Testamentas invalid. The most powerful figures decided that beinga permanent Council memberwas better than riskinga many-sided fightfor rulershipofthe town, for surely thosewho electedits Lord Mayor heldthe real reinsof power. Sothe willofthe last Lord Yggswas carriedont, and Yggsburghandits adjacent landsare free, ruledbyan elected Lord Mayor, this condition existingfor over 90 years.

It neednotbe stressed thatthe Councilisso divided amongst powerand interest gronps thatit rarely actsin unity, sothe Lord Mayoris quite secureinhis 10-year office tenureas longashe performs reasonably welland avoids open graftand corruption.

Itis disturbingtothe ruling eliteofthe town thatthe property owning burghers have recently proposedan elected Assemblyto assistthe Lord Mayorand Council through adviceand consent, for matters pertainingtothe common folk. All property owners would vote, andthe 25 candidatesforthe Assembly receivingthe most votes wouldbe seated therein. Neitherthe Lord Mayornorany Conncilorhas esponsedthe suggestion, andthe property ownersare becoming insistent. Thereis talkof withholding taxesand forminga Citizen's League with serjeantsat armsto keep order.

## Yggsburghandthe Worldat Large

†

Yggsburghandits environsare largein content, butthe areaof landit coversis relatively small, abit less than 1,700 square miles (oran areaof some 50 miles east-to-west, 34 north-to-South). With some inclusionof areas "offthemap," that sizeis sufficientfor much adventuringbut shouldbe small enough, at most perhaps 3,000orso square miles, ifallthe border areas describedinthe adventure textare included, tofit intoany campaign world, whateveroneis usedbythe Castle Keeper. The areais likewise suitableto serveasthe corefor buildinga complete campaign world aroundit should thatbe desired, a major undertakingtobe sureandnota subjectfor further discussion here.

The societyof Yggsburghis assumedtobe basically Western European, rather Englishin culture, and generally feudalin political structure. Feudalismis definedas lordshipand vassalage, the vassal owingthe lord fealty, service, and taxes fromthe fief granted. Asin later medieval times, a fiefof landis hereditary, asisthe title that goes withit. Only treasonora like crime empowersthe lordto reclaimthe fiefand title. Knighthoodisnon-hereditary,

### Setting, Historyand Culturebut lands grantedtoa knight passon entiretohis eldest male heir (primogenitureand entail). Feudalismis decentralized government, with vassals governing their fiefs, notthe lord, and metingont even high justice (capital punishment included) in regardsto villeins. Herethe feudalismisamixofthe agrarian manorial fiefsanda kindof pension fief. Thatis, someofthe vassals receive business enterprisesin returnfor their vassalage insteadof land. Such enterprise yields theman incomefor which theyowe fealty, service, and taxes. Inany case, both sortsof fiefs mustbe managed properlyto supportthe vassalsand generateatax return.

The manorial fief includes villeins bonndtothe landand dwellingin villages, receivingalllawand justice from their lord. The manorial fief also encompasses yeomen, freemenwhoown their landby having paid over moneytothe vassalforit, socmen, freemenwhopay renttothe vassalfor their land, and communitiesof such free folk. Freemenare entitledto high justice, that dispensedbythe overlord, for major crimes, but theyare subjectto local (low) justicefor ordinary misdemeanors.

Note that many placesin this settingare independentofthe Townof Yggsburgh, havean independent lord, orare freeofany vassalage. Garham, for example, is just sucha place. For purposesof this setting, the communitiesof free folkare classedas "thorps," settlementsof some 100 persons, and "hamlets," communitiesof 200or more persons, but under 1,000 (where "town" becomes proper name). The Castle Keepercan assumeone craftor trade businessfor every 50 inhabitants over 100 personsina community. So, a thorpof 150 persons might well havea blacksmithoranale House, whilea hamletof 250 population would have bothand perhapsa general storeas well. The business fief doesnot includeallof that, butthe workersare employedatthe whimofthe vassalandhe dispenseslow justiceto them, including lifeand death, and might havethe powerof taxation.

## Local Palatine Nobles

†

The lands near Yggsburghare controlledby local Palantine Nobles. Theyare: tothe West, Lyle Baronof Redfort, tothe Northeast Bertram Conntof Easmoor, tothe East Edgar Marquisof Talworth, and Talworth's vassal, the Wizard Lord Uvoll Darktarn.

The Castle Keeperis leftto developthe majorityof chief henchmenof these competing noblesif theyareto playa significant roleinthe campaign. The Wizard Uvoll Darktarn, the main agentof Marquis Talworth, is described furtheroninthe textand repeatedinthe Ordersof Battle appendix. Eachofthe noblemen will havea wizard, cleric, and several lesser lordsand/or knightsas liegemen. They might well havea thief spymasterandan assassin serving themas well.

Usingthe information suppliedinthe Appendix I, Ordrersof Battle, the troops availableto Yggsburghandto Lord Uvoll, onecan develop extensive ordersof battleforthe three rival nobles, or simply have such detailsas amorphonsand inconsequentialto play becauseno large-scale invasion willbe dealt withinthe campaign. If military detailsare undertaken, make sure thatthe forces fieldedbythe threeare considerably larger that those availableto Yggsburgh, asan attacker confrontingafoeina fortified city needsto havea superior forceto havea chanceof prevailing. Of course, the basic forcesofthe three mightbe only slightly superiorto thosethe Lord Mayorcan muster, withthe attacking nobleor nobles using mercenariesand humanoid troop additionsasthe meansforoneorthe otherto attempt conquest.

## The Cultureof Yggsburgh

†

The Castle Keeper shouldnot consider this frivolons information. Where more than hack & slash playis involved, social customand dressare importantfor settingthe stagefor role-play activity. One's characteris judged initiallyby appareland manners. Of course, informing playersof fashionand customs means they should have their charactersbe concerned about such thingsas hygieneand grooming, proper costumeand accessories, andthe right sortof weaponto have when appearinginthe town's better areas. Evenif theydonot become involvedin "bettering" their social standing, the players willbe likelyto want their characters acceptedby thosein powersoastoat leastnotbe huntedas criminals. Having connectionsin high places paysoff.

Onthe plus side fromthe Castle Keeper's standpoint, thisnot only enconragesalotof interaction withthe business establishmentsofthe town (costingthe characters considerable sumsof money), butinthe process makes thema targetfor cutpurses, pickpockets, andall mannerof other thievesand swindlers.

The exceptiontothe followingisthe militarymanwho wears his uniform sans heavy armorand weapons when socializing. See Appendix I, Ordersof Battle, The Citadel, and Yggsburgh Encounter, 7. The Citadel hereafterfor uniform descriptions.

#### Social Classes

Thereare four socioeconomic classesor standings described herein, each class having tiers withinit: underclass, lower class, middle class, upper class. The incomesare high, the societyis well- to-do, and that makes plentyof opportunityfor underclass theft, as wellasfor covetonsnessin neighboring nobles.(Fora thorongh expositionof this subjectthe readeris referredtothe book _lieiug Pautasy_, also publishedby Troll Lord Games.)

**Underclass** This includesnon-free persons suchas slaves, villeins, free persons without propertyand unemployed (beggars, masterlessmenand vagabonds), andall known criminals, even thosewho practicean approvedor licensed wrongful activity suchas theft, prostitution, or begging. Thereare three standard tiers-lower, middle, and upper. The upper classis comprisedofthe most successful criminal element. Mostin this classarenot numerateor literate. Average annual incomeis indeterminate, butthe membersofthe uppermost tierofthe criminal underclassare wealthy.

**Lower Class** Free folkof little economic meanswho range from common laborersinthe lower tier, through peddlersinthe middle, to servantsofthe upper classatthetop tier. The least clerics, friars, monks, and nunsarein this class, butinthe upper tierofit. becauseof ecclesiastic educators, assume someofthe persons hereare numerate, barelysointhe lowest tier, inthe middle barely literate, andinthe upper tier most persons numerateand literateas wouldbe providedbya fourth grade education. Average annual incomefor this strata, from lowest tierto highest, excludingthe clergy, is: 500-800gp, 1,000-1,700gp, 2,000-3,000gp.

**Middle Class** Free folkof moderate economic meanswho range from small tradesmeninthe lower tier, through craftsmeninthe middle, to wealthy merchantsatthetop tier. The average local clericisin this class. The middleand upper tiersof this classare fully numerateand generally literate, as wouldbe providedbyan eighth gradeor higher education. Average annual incomefor this area, from lowest tierto highest, is: 1,500-3,000gp, 3,700-6,200gp, 700-25,000gp.

**Upper Class** The very wealthy freemenand aristocratswho range from great landownersand bankersand gentle folkinthe lower tier, knightsand petty noblesinthe middle, tothe great nobilityofthe townandits Lord Mayorinthetop tier. The high clericsarein this class. The average educationof this classis greaterinthe lower tier thanin muchof those above, withan average educational level equalto completionof high school. Average annual incomefor this area, from lowest tierto highest: 23,000-45,000gp, 37,000-100,000gp, 63,000-140,000gp.

**Dress, Style, Appearanceand Manners**

Both malesand femalesin Yggsburgh wear particular stylesof clothingand have precise mannersof dressing their hair. Theseare discussed below. Itis suggestedthe Castle Keeperbeat least nominally awareof thisand describe those Encountersin some detailto impart this upon those playinginthe game. This heightensthe detailand adds depthtoany game. Most players appreciate this, andit wouldbea shamenotto capitalizeonthe information providedto createa better game.

**Males**

**Hair Wigsof blondeandred-blonde colorat shoulder length, with curls beforethe ears, arethe fashionforall aristocratsand well-to-do citizensofthe town, somen's hair beneath themis close-cropped. This includes demi-humans, as wellas humans. The less-affluentofthe lower middleand upper lower class, thatare unableto afforda properwig, wear their natural hairin like style. The commonersofthe middle lowerand lower lower class, andthe underclass, of course, wear their hairin bowl-like cuts that have beenthe stylefora decadeor morenow.

**Beard No proper gentlemanhas more facial hair than perhapsa small moustacheand short beardon chin. The majorityofthe aristocratsand well-to-do citizensare clean-shaven. Only dwarf citizensnow wear beards, and those dwarves wishingto retain social status trim their moustacheand beardtobutafew inches length.

**Hat** The latest modeisa square-crownedhat, one corner forward, witha moderately broadup-curled brimall round saveforthe forepart wherea long, pointed visor protrudes. The colorofthehat must either matchor contrastin complimentary manner withthe cloak, orin warmer weatherthe coat, ofthe wearer. The usualhat colorsare brownred, dark orangered, dark amber, sage green, brown ranging fromthe darkesttoa very lighthue, sand yellow, and dove gray.

A bandatthe baseofthe crown holds feathersor plumes. Sedate noblesand gentlemen wear tall upstanding feathersofa suitable coloratthe backofthehat, the more thus sportedthe higherthe station proclaimed. The Lord Mayorhas fiveinafan, but eventhe wealthiest commoner wouldnot dareto wear more thanone.

**Outer Garment** Nowin voguefor whenthe weatheris coolerisa three-quarter length velvet cloak wornin toga-like manner, withthe left sideofthe body coveredandthe right open. This cloakis fastenedatthe right shoulderbya large, broach-likepin.

Goldisthe signof wealth, andthe noblesand very wealthy have precions stonesset intothe gold. The less affluent have silverset with ornamental stones suchas agate. Onlythe least affluent have plain silveror brass cloak pins with glass "stones." Tobe properthe colorofthe cloak mustbean earth tone regardlessofthehueof other garments beneathit, so terra cotta, redand yellow ochre, gray green, various browns from very darkto neartan, sand color, and medium grayare typical.

**Other Clothing** Themanof means wearsa fine satinor silk frock coat underhis cloak. This garmenthasa buttock-length skirt, andiscut awayin front. The most fashionable models have laceatthe collarand cuff, the sleeves being rather largesoasto accommodatea lace-frilled handkerchiefinone, a nosegayinthe other. Most models have both ontsideand inside pockets, but inner bulgesarea signof baseness, asifthe wearerhashis coat's pockets filled with papersandthe like that imply common work.

A tight, long sleeved cuirass-like doublet coveringthe body from neckto waistis worn underthe frock coat. Note that while appearingtobe expensive clothing, this garment might wellbe actual body armorof padded clothor cloth-coveredoil-boiledand hardened leather. A baldricfora swordis usually worn overthe shoulderofthe doublet, althoughthe most recentfad amongst young bravosisto omit this sword hangerand swordin favorofa walking staff, as explained hereafter under Weapons.

Knee-length britches, tied tightlyatthe kneeand matchingthe colorofthe doublet, are worn with hoseandlow, slipper- like shoesby some, butthe more dashing have boots that reachthetopofthe britches.

With doubletand britchesof golden yellow, a scarlet sash separatingthe

two matching garments, this fellow presentsa dashing image thatall will recognizeas someoneof high stationand some considerable means.

**Jewelry** In additiontoa cloakpinas already detailed, the most important pieceofmen's jewelryisa neck chain that shouldbe worn atopthe doublet. This chain shouldbeof gold (bothredand white goldare acceptable) andset with gemstones. To indicate highest status, the center medallionisone's badgeof knighthoodor symbolof town, college, or guild office. Otherwise, a larger stone willdo. The less affluent have fewer gems, or noneatall, but onlythe leastofthe middle class would dreamof wearinga silver neck chain. Next comesa jewel-studded watch keptinthe pocket, witha gold chain pinnedtothe frock coat's front, depending from this chaina bejeweledfobof goldand gemsto show thatthe unseen timepieceis alsoofthe most expensive sort. As withthe neck chain, the metaland jewelsof watch, chain, andfob indicate classand social status. Lastly, the proper aristocrat should weara ring witha large precions stoneonthe forefingerofthe left hand, this fitting overthe glove.

**Weapons** A dagger depending fromthe beltisde rigueur. No heavy swordis proper. The only fashionably acceptable weaponof this sortisa small sword withan overall lengthofno more thattwoanda half feet. The scabbardforit mustbe fancy, andthe weapon's quillionsand pommel must display inset stonesofat least semi-precions sortif statusistobe maintained.

Many young bravos have abandonedthe baldricand small swordin favorofa walking stick calleda feather staff. Itisof about four feet length witha metal head portion, thus suitableforusein offenseand defense. The wieldercanat will depressa catch neartheend knob, and witha firmrapofthe buttofthe feather staff release three blades thatfanont fromthe upper portion. These bladesare slender, sharp- edged, and thinly pointed; the centraloneisof 18or more inchesin length, thetwo angling side bladesof fiveorsix inchesin length meantto catchan opponent's weapon, or deliver slashing damageifa thrust withthe main blade missesits mark.

**Females**

**Hair** Following masculine fashion, womenof qualityin Yggsburgh have also adoptedthewig. These wigsare curled, longand attractive, generallyof either palest platinum blondeor blue-blackin color. Natural hairis worn relatively longand pinnedup underthewig. Those women thatare socially conscionsbut unableto affordan expensivewig wear their tressesina manner meantto comeas closeto looking likeawigas possible. Those commonersnot concerned with fashion continueto braid their hair, eitherina long queueof broad plaits worn downthe backorastwo tightly braided strands wornin front.

**Cosmetics** A lady's complexionis meantto showher status, andasitisnow fashionablefor womenof qualityto engageinthe chase, and playat ontdoor games suchas croquetand badminton, a lighttanisthe correct thing. Those socially conscions femaleswhodonot haveoneuse powderto convey this effect. The usual rangeof other beauty enhancing cosmeticsare also employed-eyelinerand eyelid pigments (blueifa whitewigis worn, greenor roseifthewigis black), mascara, and rongefor lipsandtoadd colortothe cheek. However, asredis considered passé, the colorsin vogueare scarlet orangeand mauveforthe lips.

**Hat** When engagingin ontdoor activities suchas sports, nowigis worn, andthe headis coveredbyacap withalow, pointed crownanda short, likewise pointed visor. Whenat homeorontandin townthe ladyof fashion wearsa velvetor silkcap sewn with metallic threadsof goldandor silver, set with seed pearlsof small figures suchas butterfliesor flowersof bright, tiny beadwork. Thisis fastened with long, bejeweled pins atopherwig. Whenata more formal activityor occasion, she wearsa silkor satinhatofthe same colorasher dressor gown. Such hatsare broad-brimmed witha large, puffy crownto accommodatethewig beneathit. Theseare removed when indoorsata banquetor other sortof party, so thatthewigandits adornmentcanbe properly displayed. Common females wear linen caps thatare flonncedand unfastened, or plainandtie beneaththe chin.

**Outer Garment** Velvet cloaksof near floor-lengthand generallyofa pastel colorare worn whenthe weatheris inclementor colder. The cloakis held closed belowthe throatbya gold chain that claspsto either sideofthe material, all threeofthe fastening partsset with gemsand pearls, of course. As withmen's cloak pins, onlythe lower income folksdon't have goldand gems, the less affluent having plain goldor silverset with ornamental stones suchas turquoise, andthe least moneyed having only ordinary wronght silver. The insideof such cloaksis lined witha bright silk clothofthe same colorasthe onter velvet, butof stronghue; thus, for example, a pale yellowone willbe lined with saffron-colored silk. The ordinary women makedue with ordinary cloaks thattie shut, these garments usually worn witha cowlin cooler weather.

**Other Garments** Dress fashion dictates thata daytime garment coverthe throatandthe armstothe elbowsorthe wrist, thetop rather likea doublet, while evening ones havealow, square bodice, a back that leavesthe lower neck exposed, and nearlyno sleeves. All such dresses wornby ladiesof quality havea considerable indrawn waistto accommodatea broad beltin daytime, and gowns withno waistlineinthe evening.

Coinofthe Realm

In Yggsburghno foreign coinscanbe legally accepted, asthe town mintsitsown coinsofall metalsand denominations, andthe possessorof such money willbe directedtoa bankor money changer. The rateof exchangeis 90% of actual metal value. Foreign coinsare melted downatthe Mintand recastas Yggsburgh models. Yggsburgh posseses distinctive coins, meaning that foreign coinis easily recognized. The coins comein various denominations, weightsand values.

1gp = 1 ounce gold 1sp = 1 ounce silver 1cp = 1 ounce copper

**Gold Coins** The "heads" portionofthe gold coinisa portraitof Lewis Garmonde, last Lord Yggs. The "tails" hasthe armorial bearingsofthe town. Gold coins comeinthe following denominations.

1gp coin,.5gp coin,.2gp coinand.1gp coin

1cp coin,.5cp coin,.2cp coinand.1cp coin

This system converts readilytoany coin name, with 1gp being whatever coin namethe Castle Keeper wishes-bezant, crown, ducat, florin, etc. Ifyou likea more complex system, call gold pieces "crowns" and "half-crowns," etc. Silver mightbe called "florins," and copper coins "thalers," for example. If goldisnotas valuablein your game system, simply reducethe amonntofit fonndin that system, substitute silverin placeof someof goldtofitthe more realistic value used (gold being assumedas 50 times more valuable than silver, and silver withan exchange basis equalto 10 timesits weightin pure copper), andthe generally accurate relationshipof metal values.

**Town Revenues**

When addedto income from loansand investments, the total annual profitforthe townisinthe areaof 450,000gp. Subtracting 45,000gpforthe Lord Mayor's bonus, and 22,500gpfor each Councilor (a totalof 225,000gp), this leavesan average annualnet gaintothe treasury reserveof 225,000gp.

The Brick Workshas nearby dwellings housing some 200 persons, again about 50of them being employed making bricksand transporting them. Surronndingthe buildings-works proper, kilns, and storage sheds-tothe Southare vast monndsof clay. Theseare fromthe diggingofthe canal. As that waterwaywas constructed, itwas discovered thatthe clay being removedforthe channelwas perfectfor making firebricks.

**The Insiders**

This areais locatedtothe eastof Inside Streetand northof Bankside Lane, but excludingthe buildings alongthe west sideof Nemo Streetandthe South sideof East Road, allof whichare businesses. This central sectionof about four square blocks extentis filled with tenementsand penny-rent buildings, in whichthe many lower class laborers dwell.

The inhabitantsare mostly casual laborers workingthe canalor seeking employmentin town. They number around 2,500, andof that number some 500are membersofthe underclass, unableto enter Yggsburgh, about halfof them criminals. The homeless beggars herearenot includedinany population figures. Their likely numberis 100or more.

**The Mills**

This areais locatedatthe northendof Mills Road afterit turns northeastand becomes Shanty Track. Thisisthe locationofa large Grist Mill (Yggsburgh Encounter, 87. The Grist Mill). Thisisa large mill House witha water wheel being drivenbya flume diverting water fromthe Urt Riverto falland powerthe great device.

The populationis ronghly 4,000 total. The eastern populationof this area consistsof five farm families, totaling 60 persons when hired handsare included. Twoofthe farmsare diary operations with orchardsand apiaries, the other three being mainly truck farms that also raise hogsand small livestock. All their produce, andalot more, is consumedbythe town, of course, butthe truck farms supplya large percentageofthe vegetables eatenin Yggsburgh, anda fair amonntofthe eggs, ponltry, and pork.

The northernand southern river-fishers' thorps each have about 120 inhabitantsina scoreorso small buildings. Their catches likewise helpto feedthe townsfolk.

The Mills have associated laborers' cottages that House some 400 persons, 100of them being mill workers, the remainder family members.

The Brick Works alsohas nearby dwellings ownedbythe factoryand housing some 200 persons, again about 50of them being employed making bricksand transporting them.

Fromthe playhonse South along Mills Streettothe boat works thereareno houses, andany population found hereis homelessand transient.

Southof East Roadand westof Nemo Streetisthe community called The Outs, soitis Outs proper. This placewas settledby thosewho didn't want town restrictionsand taxation, or conldn't affordto livein Yggsburgh. The Outs proper covers some 10 square blocksandhasa populationof around 3,000 persons, as manyofthe buildingsinthe areaare storageand warehouse facilities, or elselow-class entertainment places suchasrat-baitingand cock-fighting pits, aleand bawdy houses, or cheap cookingand eating establishments. Note thatthe underclass, including criminal underclass, comprises about 20% (600) ofthe population here. Its sizeis nearly thatofa town, butithasno such formal organizationforits government.

**Rivermen's Town**

This areais located betweenthe Yggsburgh Canal from Nearmoat Laneto Inside Street (west side only) and alongthe South sideof Bankside Laneto Nemo Street. This oddly-shaped area, equaling about three square blocksin extent, contains manylow divesand seamy entertainment establishments, storage buildingsand warehonses, in additionto some numberof normal trade storesand craft shops, andafew private residents along Bankside Lane. The population numbers about 500 individuals, mostof whomare lower classor underclass persons.

**The Sawmill**

Thisisthe second large mill Houseonthe Urt River. It alsohasa very large water wheel drivenbya flume that diverts river waterto falland turnthe great device. The wheel's shaftand gears operate saws thatcut logs into timbersand planks, the lumber usedin building structures, boats, ships, and land vehiclesas wellasall mannerof furniture.

Thereare some 50 persons workinginthe sawmill, bringingin logstobe squared, seeingtothe cuttingof logs into postsor boards, carrying that lumbertothe adjacent drying sheds, or loading ready

**Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh** lumber into vehiclesfor transport. Across fromthe Sawmill along Mills Roadare cottagesin which dwell some 200 persons, the workersand families. This sawmillandthe cottagesare ownedin fiefby Sir Eberhardt Beemish.

**Urt River Fishers' Thorp**

This thorpis located along Bankside Lane eastof Nemo Street. Itisa collectionof 20orso small cottagesand shanties occupiedby fisherfolkand theirilk.

**General Architectural Style**

Firstand foremost, all major constructioninthe walled communityisof stone, brick, ora combinationofthetwo. Onlyon back alleys, andina slum-like areas, will therebe fonndany buildingsof timberand plaster, or frame onesof planks. The building codesofthe townare strictsoasto minimizethe threatof fire.

Furtherand importantly, the armorial bearingsofthe free townare fonndon many public buildings above their entries. Thisisan escutcheonof gold witha blue chevron separatingtwo blue pikes (or luce, fish) aboveanda blue mailed fistatthe base. Abovethe escutcheonisa crestofa city gatein gray stone crownedbya coronetof gold with five acorn-topped points. To either sideofthe escutcheon, supportingit, are giant lynxes standingon their hind legs with paws tonchingthe shield. The motto belowthe escutcheon reads: Nonecan denyus independence.

The town's grand temple standsont becauseofits sizeand unique architecture. The exact architectural styleofthe structureis lefttothe Castle Keeper, foritisa functionofthe pantheonof deities establishedbyhimas that honoredbythe majorityofthe community. The less-imposing templesand other religions buildings must likewisebe determinedbythe Castle Keeper. Itis suggested that such placesof worshipforthe populationbe very ornateor exoticsoasto clearly indicate theyare special. For example, ifa Greco-Roman typeof pantheonis assumed, the grand temple wouldbea vast rectangular structure with tall columnsset aroundit, behind thema walkway, and thenthe actual wallsofthe building. To differentiateit from this world's historical models, it might have tall square towersatthemid-partof each side wall. These towers wouldbe considerably higher thanthe grand temple's roof, and have protecting from theirown roof peaks spires toppedbythe main symbolof their pantheon. A pylon-shaped structure, domes, or stepped upper storiesare also viable. Use your imagination, butdon't straytoofar froma basically European modelsoasto retain continuity.

Other largeand formal buildings, suchas town government, college, and major commercial onesare constructedin something likethe Gothic style, but Roman archesareas commonly seenasthe pointed onesof that architectural style. The sameis trueofthe pillarsand pedimentsof such buildings.

The majorityofthe structuresinthe communityarenotso grandand impressive, of course. These buildingsare typicalof European medievaland Renaissance construction, built with walls abutting each otherand often with narrow street frontage, of several stories height, withthe upper floors projecting overthe

**Setting, Historyand Culture**

sidewalktoadd space. To allow natural light intothemid-portionsof crowded buildings, most common ones have light wells, and mansionsare built arounda central atrium. Afew blocksofthe town have buildings constructedin square arounda central close. Otherwise, the usual formisa walled yard stretching fromthe rearofthe main structuretothe alley behindit, occasionally with some ontbuildings standingatthe edgeofthe alley rather thana rear wall.

Onlythe mansionsand other buildingsofthe aristocratsdonot stand abutting their fellows, even though land insidethe wallsis limited, andall space valuable. The housesofthe wealthy also have rear lawnand garden areas. In style such places look rather like Roman villas, or Georgianif madeof firebrick.

As this areahasa warm temperate climate, the roofsof buildingsdonot havea steep pitch, forno great accumulationof snow ever piles onto them. They look more like those seenin Italianand French Renaissance architecture than thoseofthe same periodin Englandor Germany, for example, and manyare flatand usedin warm weatherasa partofthe dwelling.

**Buildings**

you will note that while thereis extensive information pertainingtothe Free Townof Yggsburgh, hereandinthe Appendix, mostofthe buildingsina communityof this sizearenot detailed. The main reasonfor thisis lackof space. It would takea work threeor more times this sizeto providethe Castle Keeper with such comprehensive treatment. Secondly, and actuallyof equal import, the exhaustive detailing wouldbeof littleuse, asthe playersare quite unlikelytobe interestedin investigating every businessand residenceina townof over 20,000 population. Whatis given herein will allowthe ambitions Castle Keeperto actually create complete blocksofthe town, fill each with buildings, notethe sortof commercial activity that takes placein business structures, and decidewho livesin residential buildings. A perusalofthe Appendix will sufficeto supplythe Castle Keeper withthe numberof buildingsona given block, and thereisa listof nearly 200 different commercial undertakingsforusein having various businessesin appropriate blocks.

The sheer sizeofthe town preventsa large-scalemap that detailsthe many buildingsandallthe traffic arteries that existinthe place. Thereare effectively 92 square-block areasinthe town, this area honsingallthe citizensandso forth. The Castle Keeper willbe called uponto supply fine details, sothe following informationis important.

**Square **Blocks **and **Plazas Regardlessof what sortsof arteries surround them, each regular square blockis 460 feetper side, that measurement excluding sidewalks.

**Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh**

The alley sidesare self-explanatory, and these buildingsdonot usually haveany extensive rear yard area, so their back portionsare accessedbythe alleyor gangways only. Note that such paths mightbe dead ends. The distance from cornerto cornerofa building's frontingis 460 feet. The average numberof separate structures dependsonthe neighborhood, and alley-side building count doesnot includethe corner structures.

They often pass under extended firstand other upper floors, possibly having steps going downto basement levelto allow traffictoget pastthe main floorof structures witha ground floor raised above street level. Such gangways serve bothto allow foot trafficto passtothe rearofthe buildingandto enable building sidesto have window openingsfor lightandair.

**Town Arteries**

The Castle Keepercan assumethe following facts regardingtothe townof Yggsburgh.

**Arteries Allthe waysinthe townare paved with cobblestonesor firebrick, the latter being usedfor smaller paths suchas lanes.

**Sidewalks** Sidewalksareof limestoneor slate slabs, or else firebricks. Theyare raised abovethe artery they parallelbyat leastsix inches. Immediately besidethe walkwayisa gutter depression leadingto periodically-spaced sewer drains.

**Wall Paralleling Ways** Allthe arteries parallelingthe wallare 40 feet across, withan inner walkof 10 feetin widthandan onter marginof 50-foot width, a parkway (in grass) between their pavementandthe wall proper, save wherethe wall towers project inwardsandat town gates. The parkway around town gatesis paved overto form small, plaza-like areas.

**Avenuesand Thoronghfares These arteriesare 40 feetin widthand have sidewalksof 10 feetin width.

**Streets** Theseare ways thatare 30 feetin widthand have sidewalksof 10 feetin width.

**Parkway** Two 12-foot width lanes withasix-foot wide stripof lawn/small trees between them.

**Lanes **and **Other **Ways Lanesand most Waysare 20 feetin widthand have sidewalksof five feetin width.

**Alleys althoughnot shownonthemap, any blockof normal sizeor largerhasan alleyway running thronghits center, thisway being 10 feetin widthand hedgedby building wallsor fencesin most places.

**Street Lighting** The townhasno systemof street lights. All alleyways willbe generally very dark.

Parksarenot illuminated. City gatesare fairly well-illuminatedon their interior sideby large lanterns that hang fromthe wallson either sideofthe inner gates. Warehonsesand factoriesare generallylit only with small lanterns besideor above entry doors. Lowerand lower middle class streets willbe generally dark, savefor ambient illumination from doorsand windows thatare openor glassedandthe interiors behind them lighted. Shuttered windowsare typicalat night whereno businessis being solicited. Scholastic area streets will have building-front lightsfor school buildingsand commercial establishments.

Upper middleand upper class streets will have some fair amonntof illumination from building-front lights. Manyof such lights willbeof magical sort. Whenan aristocratis hostinga partythe residence will usuallybe illuminated with fanciful colored lights that moveand/orarein exotic shapes, these being createdby meansof dweomer.

Commercial buildings thatare openfor business after dark will have illumination suchas lanternsor magical lights near their signand entry. Affluent commercial buildings will likewise have lights near their entryto discourage criminals from breakingin.

**Street Cleaning** Asa partofits servicesthe townhasa forceof 30 street sanitation personnel, 24of whichare street sweeperswho make their rounds daily. They havea wheeled cart, large broomand shovel, and either collectthe refuse they sweepupor else pushit intoa gutter draintobe carriedoff intothe sewers. Accumulated wasteis taken backto their main building, loaded into horse-drawn wagons, and dumpedoffthe Townbridgeat first light before anyoneis allowed intothe community. The swift- flowing River Nemo moves this waste downstreamin short order.

**Setting, Historyand Culture**

**Water & Sewer** As with street cleaning, Yggsburghhasa wateranda sewer department. Eachhas some 20 employees, including plumbersand laborerswho mantain these services.

The townhasan artesian well springing fromits westernend. This wateris piped intoan underground reservoir there, the latter supplying water mains laid underthe streets. Allthe buildings ownedby those well-offare connectedtoa water main, so thereis running waterin most buildings. Those buildingsnot supplied with plumbingfor indoor waterand sewer mustto relyon rooftopor basement cisternsand city fonntainsinthetwo plazas (Market Plazaand Citadel Square) and gates (Bridgegate, Moat Gate, River Gate), or park-sited wells.

Thereare hydrants connectedtothe water mainsonthe cornersof about every-otherofthe town's blocks. Oncea week theseare openedfora short periodof timeto flushthe gutters clean.

Thereisan extensive underground sewer system running from westto eastand emptying intothe River Nemoatthe sontheast corner nearthe tower there. Mostofthe buildingsinthe townare connectedtothe sewer lines, and only somefewofthe "East End" blocks wherethe lowest tierofthe lower class dwell relyon onthonsesand cesspoolsfor waste storage. Very little human wasteis dumped intothe guttertobe flushed down intothe sewersby released wateror rain. Waste from onthonsesis collected from themby hired waste removal contractors called Honey Dippersor Tom Turd Men.

**Noteson Heraldry**

Asthe armorial bearingsof places, organizations, and peopleare signatures, theyare importantina fantasy campaign. Onlyone aspectof heraldry willbe addressed here, thatisthe tinctures usedin blazon. **The **standard **colors **used blue (azure, light blue), green (vert), red (gules), and purple (purpure).

The Yggsburgh Canal servesasa moat, as wellasa canal, linkingthe Urtand River Nemo eastof their confluence. This waterwayis 100 feet wideforits entire lengthofone mile. Its bottomisdug down 40 feetto bedrock, andits banksareof worked stonesoasto ensureno erosionof them.

Wherethe East Road comestoanendatthe Yggsburgh Canal, 1,200 feet northofthe River Nemo, thereisa partial cansewayonthe east sideofthe waterway. This stone structureis builton arched piers, the five openings between spans being 12 feet wide, with three-foot thick piers. This covers 78 feetofthe canal's width. Onthe westernendofthe canseway thereisa long drawbridge, 20 feetin length, set intoa projecting stone plinth that jutsont three feet fromthe onter faceofthe town's Eastgate. This structure, cansewayand drawbridgeare collectively calledthe Moat Gate. In timeof siegethe drawbridgeis raised, of course.

Numerons small watercraft, boatsand bargesare allowedto moor alongthe eastern sideofthe Yggsburgh Canal. Someof these vesselsarethe private propertyof wealthy townsfolk, some commercial, buta large numberare boatsand bargesin which common folk have their homes. No watercraftare allowedtotieuponthe western sideofthe canal, so thatatall times thereis ample roomfor trafficin both directionsonthe waterway.

**Adventure Hook**

When traveling alongor besidethe canal, the party noticesa large riverboat mannedby especially villainons-looking crewmen. If theypay attention, theyseethe vesseltieupina place betweentwo similar boats, and shortly thereafter hands fromthe newly arrived craftare seen going aboardthetwo boats they moored between. Theseare river pirates, and theyare hereas partofa planto attackand capture several mineralore barges that willbe coming downthe Nemo River fromthe Glittering Knobs. The raiders planto boardtheore bargesas they enterthe canaland killor throw overboardthe crews. Then they will sail westto Dunfalconand disposeofthe ships, where they hopeto reapa greatsum from this piracy.

The characters will needtodo some investigatingatthe Boatman Tavernin The Outs Inn (see Yggsburgh Encounter 80. The Outs Inn) toget pertinent information aboutthe pirates, their whereabontsand other useful facts. Luckilyfor them they havea full 24 honrsto discoverthe plot, becausethe arrivalofthe shipmentof mineralsisaday behind schedule. Thwartingthe piracy should earn thema decent cash reward fromthe mineral factors whose bargesand cargoesare thus saved.

The Castle Keeper should preparethe detailsof this Encounter, being sureto keepthe party's levelin mind.

The Oracle Statue: The statueofthe beautiful smiling woman arrayedina formal gown (ofa wedding style froma time long past), witha laurel leaf crownanda bonquetof roses, that standsinthe centerofthe South Gardensis most unusual, fornoone knowshowit cametobe whereitis. This statueis composedofan unknown translucent metal.

The reasonitis calledthe Oracle Statueis that sometimesthe sculptureis knownto speak. The statue radiatesa magical auraof indeterminate sort. People have been knowntoaskthe oracle questions, and sometimesthe oracle respondsby glowingand with animated faceand month. This makesit very popular withthe common folk, and many people come here regularly, hopingforan answer. Sometimesit will speakonitsown withno prodding.

Thisisa trick, however. A potent illusionisthassetup this scam-the illusionist observes people here, and will secretly castan illusion thatis akintoa magic month, responding when certain conditionsaremet. His goalsare random-sometimeshe will actuallydoa good dead, other timeshe willtryto manipulatean aristocrator wealthy personto provide some benefittohim financially (usually indirectly), and sometimeshe justhasthe statue make randomand vague proclamationsfor amusement.

Whatthe illusionist doesn't knowis that thereis moretothe statue. Donated froma private collection, the statueis actuallya powerful succubus forced intoa formof binding, onewho took human formand triedto tricka powerful wizard intoa romantic relationship. The wizard discovered this trickand createda trapped laurel leaf crownto forcethe demon intoits current state.

**Encountersin Yggsburgh**

Ifthe bindingcanbe broken-likelyby tryingto destroyoneofthe illusionist's enchantment-the creature willbe freed, not knowing what happened, but "grateful" tothe personwho freedher, andmay likelytryto forma "romantic relationship" witha memberofthe party, to serveherown evil ends. Ifshe gets information from townspeople abouther "oracle" status, she mighttryto exploit thatforherown needsas well.

#### Towerofthe Striped Mage **Location: South Palisades Avenue

**Reason:** Ordinary folk shun this place. But whenthe partyis seeking high-level magical spell-casting upon their persons, orisin needof training, or wantsto trade magic itemsfor others, thisisthe placetogo

The Towerofthe Striped Mageis locatedon South Palisades Avenueinthe middleofthe block between Offmarket Laneand Company Street. The ashlar block toweris paintedin spiral stripesofredand white, a truly bizarre decoration (see below). Itisa great hexagonal structure thatis 50 feet wideper onter face, five stories high, witha hexagonal penthonseof 30-foot-widthper face that

reaches another 20 feet height. The toweris thusoneofthe tallest structuresinthe town. Onthe South face, wherethe main entrytothe toweris, thereisa 12-foot-wide crenellated stone balconyat 18-foot height that projects five feetontand overthe door stoop, andhas machicolations. Itis flankedbytwo bartizansof eight-foot diameter, and accessed fromthe second floorofthe structure.

The "decoration" was originally donebyan ontraged monkin retaliationfor much abusebythe Head Apprentice, andontof frustrationat being unabletoget backathimorhis master. Upon seeingthe colorful paint decoratinghis tower, the wizard likedit, thonghtit properly distinctiveand adding considerablytothe overall appearanceofhis domicile, sohe placedan enchantment uponitso that would remain thus indefinitely. To enhancethe effect, he decidedto wear striped apparel henceforthand adoptthe styleof "The Striped Mage." This, of course, absolutely crushedthe would-be retaliator, andno more attemptsat getting even were made.

The tower stands 40 feet fromthe frontofalot thatis 120 feet wideand 180 feet deep. Ithasall mannerof magical protections, of course, so successful breakingand entering, evenin ethereal form, is nearly impossible. The physical characteristicsof this place, in précis, are described below.

The propertyis walledto 10 feet height, witha funnel-like opening leadingtothe front entry. The openingis 30 feet wideatthe sidewalk, running back 25 feettoa 12-foot wide, 15-foot deep flightof 7 stepsandan 8 foot deep landing beforethe entry, the latter overlookedbythe balcony described above. Thereisa large doorof iron-bonndoak witha gargoyle's-head bronze knockerinthe center, butno other features.

Whenthe heavy bronze gargoyle's headis lifted upwardsandletgo, or bronght down with force, it emitsa horrible groaning growl. Inone- to four-minutes' time someone respondstothe knocker's sound. Rolla d6and consultthe chart belowto determinewho responds. Then referto their entry.

Whenever callers come, regardlessofhow many timeshehas seen them previously, he inquires fromthe balcony aboutthe natureof their business, noting that "My masterisa very busy

Ifthe characters demand entryin insulting terms, heis likelyto pull various magical pranks suchas those listed below, andthe Castle Keeper should feel freeto inventas many moreas desired. Rolla d8to determine which prankis played.

This precipitation inflicts d4 acidand d6 fire damageonallwhoareonthe stoop, stairs, or entry walk, no saving throw affectsthe ontcomeofthe damage. Each attack uponthe Head Apprentice increasesthe numberof diceof such damagebyone, toa maximumofsix each. In short, it doesn'tpayto assault this fellow.

Whatthe Head Apprentice expectsis deference fromthe characters, and thena bribe. Given unctuons politeness, despitehis sarcasmand rudeness, andno less than 5gp, he then goesand seesifhis master willseethe visitors. Assume thereisa base 50% chancethe Striped Mage willseethe party, and that each 5gp givenin bribe money increasethe chanceby 10% duetothe wheedlingofthe Head Apprentice, the maximum probability being 90%. Refusaltosee visitorsis irrevocable, buta "Call againat this time tomorrow" means thatthe party willbe received grudginglybythe Head Apprentice, showntothe smallest reception roomofhis Master, and thatthe worthy wizard will then attendto themin 2-20 (2d10) minutes time (see page 59).

**The Bronze Golem** Thisisa uniqueman-like statueof some seven feet height, some four feet wideatthe shonldersand very quickof action. shouldthe characters offerany problemsforthe golem, theymaybeinfor some tronble (see page 59).

**The Striped Mage**Truetohis more recently assumed name (he formerly styled himself The Mageofthe Tower), Cerdamont Tasjornivand wears gandily striped robesand other garments. He might also appearina velvet capeof greenand purple vertical stripes, worn overa violet robe bonndbya spirally striped sashof roseand gold.

Thisis leftinthe handsofthe Castle Keeper, butno numberof potionsand scrolls shouldbuyany potent magic item that functions continually, suchasa magic swordor ring. He will gladly purchase magic items from characters, paying full valuefor them without haggling.

In revenge, Yeeronf managedto lureoneofthe apprenticesof The Striped Mage intohis shop, subornedher (soshe stole fromher master), and causedherto bring several purloined itemsof considerable value withher whenshe cameto learn "greater lore" from Yeeronf. Forher pains, this unfaithful wizardwas paralyzed, the stolen goodsandallshe owned along with them went into Yeeronf's coffers, and soon thereaftershewas soldasa slave.

The Striped Mage'sone weak pointis Dalbid Yeeronf. Ifthe characters mention dealing withhimand evidenceany likingforhim, they willbe expelled fromthe wizard's towerand never allowed back. If, onthe other hand, they indicate true dislikeof Dalbid Yeeronf, the characters willbe treated with camaraderie, the fees charged themcutin half. Any plans they might havefor attackingand killing Yeeronf willbe aidedby suggestionsand even loansof enchanted objects that might assistin their successfully doing away with this deadly adversaryof The Striped Mage.

Usingthe coverofa Houseof astrology, the "12 Celestial houses" isthe shop from whichthe Assassins' Guild operates. As assassinationis illegalin Yggsburgh, mentionof sucha guildin upper class circles will bring disdainand suspicion, along with immediate assurance thatno such thing existsinthe town. Peopleofthe middle class will likely reporttothe authorities anyone asking aboutan assassinor guildof them. In lower class areas everyone willbe "deafand dumb" when asked. Thisis done easily, as 95% know nothingatall except vague rumors. Only counselor Horace Linnfieldis fully awareofthe operation, andheis well paidto keepit quiet.

Onlythe criminal underclasshasany real inklingofthe actual existenceofthe Assassins' Guild. If inquiriesare madeinalow dive suchasthe River Rat Tavern (see Yggsburgh Encounter 59. River Rat Tavern) thereisa 10% chanceper person asked witha 5gp bribe, that someone willlet slipthe nameofthe astrology shop. Each additional 5gp addedtothe bribe adds 10% tothe chanceof learningthe name. Each inquiryis also cumulatively 10% likelyto callthe "snoopers" tothe attentionofthe Assassins' Guild's membership. Ifthe inquiring partyis suspectedof being benton revealingthe organization, then they willbe markedfor "an accident," andthe Beggars' Brotherhoodand Thieves' Guild willspyonthe party continually until theyare killed, or wordis passed that theyareall right (see Yggsburgh Encounter 51, The Beggar's Brotherhood, and 51. The Thieves Guild).

The Assassins' Guildis secretly allied withthe legally recognized Thieves' Guild, andmay call upon themfor helpin timeof great difficulty.

**Beggars' Brotherhood** **Location: Hammer Street

**Reason: Whenthe partyis interestedin being generonsand helpingthe poor

The Brotherhoodis locatedinthe middleofthe blockonthe north sideof Hammer Street, between Moat Avenuetothe eastand Fisher Streettothe west, and faces warehonsestothe South. Itisa newerbut rundown brick building with 60 feetof frontage, three upper floorsanda loft. Nexttothe donble entry doorsaretwo square signboards witha crutch paintedononeanda beggar's bowlonthe other. Crudely lettered above eachis: "Townof Yggsburgh, Brotherhoodof Beggars." Atthe bottomof each boardis written: "Helpforthe truly unfortunate." The ground floor frontis takenupbya "greeting room" witha shabbyold desk, cabinet, afew battered chairs, and benches. Thereisa doortothe upper floorsatthe right hand (NE) back cornerofthe room, anda center door leadingtothe rearofthe floor. Well-meaning citizens stoppingbyto offera contributionof money, to donateold itemstothe Brotherhood, or inquiring aboutthe Brotherhood removing junk from their premises, are treated with unctuons politenessbythe "Greeter" seated behindthe deskand thanked profuselyand continuonsly whileinthe place. "Brother Beggars" are sent directly upstairs, orto reporttothe Beggarmaster, whose quarters occupythe rearof this floor.

Ifthe partyis interestedin being generonsand helpingthe poor, or suspicions that this gronpis linked withall sortsof crimein town, they will eventually find themselves here. The Beggars' Brotherhoodis indeed allied withthe Thieves' Guild, andmay call upon themfor helpin timeof great difficulty.

Membershipinthe Brotherhood requiresan inspectionof personand displayof begging styleand tricks. The Beggarmasterandhis henchmen observe, and passor refuse applicants. Members mustpay over 75% ofall they gainby begging, andin return theyare honsed, fed, and protected. However, consistent failuretopay overa daily averageof 1gpin coinor stolen valuables means expulsionin short order.

**Beggarmaster's **Quarters Thereisa small anteroomfor callersto awaitthe leader's attention. Tothe rightofitisa door leadingtothe officeofthe Beggarmaster, wherethe stairstothe basementare accessed. Tothe leftisthe doortohis dining room. Behindthetwo latter roomsarehis bedchamber (left) and personal lounge (right). Allofthe furnishingsin this areaare second-hand, shabbyand tawdry.

Onlythe Beggarmaster, one-armed "Alf" Drumly, andhis henchmen, the lamed "Gimpy" Wakeman, Chief Beggar, andtheone-eyed "Squints" Gillicary, Expert Beggar, and membersofthe Brotherhoodare ableto fight. Thereare, atany given time, another 2-20 each male, female, and child beggarsinthe building.

**The **Basement The basementis also accessed froma wide ontside ramp. The basementis mainly given overto great pilesofold furnitureand junk, this comingand movingontto secondhand store proprietorsand junkmen regularly. The front partis walledoffandhasa secret entrance. In hereis stored stolen goods fromthe Thieves' Guild, bronghtvia their underground tunnels, and left untilithas "cooledoff" orcanbe smuggledont hidden amongstold junk. Herethe Beggarmaster, "Alf" Drumly, keepshis storeof wineand liquor. The Thieves' Guild paysa small amonntfor hiding stolen goods here, that pocketedby Drumley, and hiresthe Brotherhood's memberstospyand serve watchersto give warningto thievesat their nefarions work. Thereisa secret doorinthe west wall that opens ontoa passage that runs generally northwest some 1,800 feettothe Thieves' Underground (see Yggsburgh Encounter 52, The Thieves Guild).

**The **Upper **Floors Thisis wherethe membersofthe Brotherhood meetand have quarters. Thetwo fireplaceson each floor servefor such cookingasis done, and onlythe lowestofnew membersdonot havea palletof sortsto sleepon where thereis some warmthin timesof cold. These unfortunatesare senttothe loft high aboveto make their beds.

Individual beggars have from 1-10spin various coinon their person. The chief's henchmenand able-bodied beggars will havea purse with 1-4gpper levelorhit dice. The only portable wealthisinthe quartersofthe Beggarmaster. "Alf" Drumlyhasa small iron coffer witha poison needle trap (10-60 HP damage, halvedifa savevs. poison succeeds) onit. Itis keptina hidden spaceinthe wall concealedbya firewoodbox. The interiorofthe spaceis dark, andsix small poisonons spiders have their webs therein.

1. "Value Second Hand Market" orthe Thieves Guild

**Location: South sideof Craft Street between Middle Thoronghfareand Crossgates Avenue

**Reason: Whenthe partyis seekingto rootont evil, recover stolen goods, or fence some they have purloined

The Value Second Hand Marketis locatedinthe middleofthe blockonthe South sideof Craft Street between Middle Thoronghfareand Crossgates Avenue. Itisinthe alley adjacenttothe building that runs northto South from north Wall Avenueto Hammer Street. The buildingisof ordinary brick, is three stories tall plusa loft, andhasa frontageof 90 feet, the eastern 30 feetof whichis dividedoff.

The Value Second Hand Market occupiestwo thirdsofthe entire buildinguptobut excludingthe loft. Many folk shop here because they believe that theyare getting really expensive stolen goodsat bargain process. Seldomis thatthe case. The basementhas used itemsofa largeand durable sort suchas metaland wood containers, furniture, and bigger sortsof tools suchas axes, picks, shovels, and sledge hammers. Thereisa back room usedforthe receptionand sortingof used items purchasedfor resale. Another much larger roomis usedto refurbish those items. The ground floorhas clothingand smaller furniture, hampersand baskets, with tableand kitchen waresinthe back. The first floorhas various piecesof larger furniture including tables, chairs, stools, benches, cabinets, cupboardsand cases. The second floorhas lighting, bedding, draperies, curtains, mirrorsand decorative objects.

The Thieves' Guild properhas onlya curtained front windowanda small sign besidethe entrance door withthe following inscribed uponit: "Benevolent Societyforthe Bettermentofthe Masterless." Even thoughthe town allows licensed theft, receivinga 20% "tax" fromall such "income," the Thieves' Guild doesnot wantto flaunt their activitiesand enragethe citizens, soithasthe Value Second Hand Marketasa front. Thieveryin Yggsburghisa complex matter, andthe Castle Keeper should read Part I, The Cultureof Yggsburgh, Crimeand Punishment, for more detailsonthe operationof thieveryasa whole. Sufficeittosay, muchofthe stolen propertyin Yggsburgh passes thronghthe Value Second Hand Market, for resale hereorin Dunfalcon City.

All floorsofthe Thieves' Guild have concealed doors accessingthe adjoining second-hand store. These doorsareinont-of-sight placessothe thievescan slipinandont without being seen. Thereisa secret entrancetothe Thieves' Undergronndinthe basement. Thereisa concealed panel that accessesthe adjoining buildings' rooftops.

**Ground Floor** Upon enteringthe Benevolent Societyforthe Bettermentofthe Masterless thereisa receptionand office areaof 27-foot widthand 20-foot depth. Insideisa bench underthe

windowanda long tableinthe middleofthe back halfofthe room, withtwo chairs beforeitandaman seated behinditwho greets entrants. Thereare three doorsinthe wall behind this desk table; theoneinthe left corner openstothe basement staircase, the centeronetoa hallway leadingto offices, andtheoneinthe right corner leadstothe stepstothe floor above. Member thieves entering thisway givethe recognition signand password, andmay passon thronghanyofthe doors their status allows. Only higher ranksmay enterthe ground floor offices. Ordinary folk calling hereare askedtobe seatedatthe desk table, soasto state their nameand business. Accordingto their wants-recoveryof stolen goods, purchaseof some specific typeof stolen goods, to giveatipona likely prospectand gaina "finder'sfee," ortoaskhowto becomea member-the Ollie Compolli (trusted lieutenant, see stats hereafter) manningthe reception desk escorts themtoan office, orinthe caseofan applicantfor membership, sends themtothe basementtobe grilledand testedbythe thieves thereinthe Thieves' Cant.

Thetwo rooms behindthe reception roomare fair sized, andthe "Rum Fixer," headofthe Racketeers, andthe "Lord Protector," headofthe Extortionists, are usuallyin their offices partof eachday. Behind these officesisa large lonngeandbarforthe higher- up thieves.

**Firts **and **Second **Floor The firstand second floorsofthe buildingare lodgingsformid-rank membersofthe guild. Thereare four roomson each floor. The loft flooris very large, of course, hasa large practice room, and dormitory sleeping spacesfor 30 persons.

**Basement** The basementhasabar, refectory, and kitchenforall members. A storeroom adjacenttothe kitchenhasa falsetun, its spigotin front yielding wine, buta secret panelinits right rear openingtoa spiral staircase leadingtothe Thieves' Underground (see below).

Thereare 21 chief membersof this guild. Eachisa headofa criminal activityas noted. A bossof this sortmay have onlyafew personsinhismob, or there mightbe many. The total membershipof this organization exceeds 1,000 persons including prostitutes. Ofthe membership, 80% are 1st level thiefs, 10% are 2nd level thiefs, 5% are 3rd level thiefs, andthe remaining 5% areoflow-level dual class fighter/thief 2/3or 4th level.

The Castle Keeper will note thatthe Thieves Guildcanbe developedin much greater detail. This detailingis leftinthe Castle Keeper's hands, soasto allow personalization accordingto your visionofthe Thieves' Guild. A helpful guideto adding great depthtothe complex workingsofthe underworldis "The Canting Crew," pennedbymeand publishedby Troll Lord Games. Thereare many underworld activities thatcanbe usedassub-plotsforthe characters' adventures, or eventhe adventures themselves. For example, slaveryandthe clandestine movementof captives intoandontofthe Thieves' Undergronndcanbe developed intoa major adventure involvingthe characters.

**The Thieves' Underground**

This placeisnot easily discoveredbythe characters. The most likelywayto discoverits existenceisifoneor moreofthe characters become membersofthe Thieves' Guild. They might visitthe Green Dragon Innand, by bribingoneofthe mainnon- player characters, learnofthe undergronndand evenhowto accessit fromthe Lower Gardens park. Thereare other means, though. The party couldbe doing detective work, watchingfor smugglers, noting themat night moving goods froma bargeor boat intothe town thronghoneofthe secret entrances nearthe gates. Asthe arbiterofall, the Castle Keeper might also decideto allow other means. Someoneatthe Bureauof Records might know aboutthe placeand reveal information. Perhapsa particularly wild college student might have seen some thieves usingthe secret entrancesinthe parks. Evena drunken memberofthe guild mightbe pumpedfor informationandlet slip that thereisa systemof hidden passages. Whateveryou decide uponis whatis right, asitis your campaign.

The tunnelsinthe complexaresix feetin width, witha heightof seven feetatthe sidesand 10 feetata barrel archinthe center. Themapisnotas fully developedasit couldbe. Critical areasare shownand explained, buta more extensive systemof passageways could existand shouldbe detailedasperthe Castle Keeper's wishes.

1. **Circular Chamber** These chambersare 12 feetin diameter. The central partisan iron grateof three-foot diameter. Halfofitis hingedsoastobe raisedto allow accesstothe sewersviaa shaftof aboutsix feet depth. Iron rungs enable descenttothe sanitation tunnels, witha standard secret door (see S, below) leading from this shafttothe sewers proper. All aroundthe grateare stone flags that serveto triggerthe releaseof some hazard. Each circular chamberhas, at random, oneofthe hazards, trapsor Encounters listed below.

Inthe next round, the other armed spriggan usesits tonch whilethe other attacks witha weapon. In this manner they willbe ableto strikeat leasttwo unopposed blows.

A character attemptingtowinby cheatingis problematicalforthe Castle Keeperto manage. The odds differencefor cheatingcanbe greator small. Thereis alwaysa chancea cheating player willbe canght. The Castle Keeper mightuseoneofthe following systems.

1. Cheating character makesa d20 roll, addingall intelligenceand dexterity modifiers. Thiefsor assassins receivean additional +1to theirdie rollper level. Thisisthe cheat roll.
1. A single Opposing Cheating rollforthenon-player- character participantsis comparedtothe cheat roll. Ifthe latteris higher, the cheaterwonthe gameand nobody suspects. Ifitisatie, orthe opposing cheat rollis higher, thenonenon-player characteris suspicionsand willbe watchingthe character. Onthe next cheating rolls, theone watchingthe character receivesa +1to their roll. Ifthe opposing cheat rollis greater thanthe character's cheat roll, thenthe character failedto properly cheat, andthewin goestooneofthenon-player characters.
1. A cheat rollof 1, regardlessof bonuses, means automatic failureandallthe other playersare suspicions. If another cheat rollis madebythe character, the opposing cheat roll willbeat +1xthe numberofnon-player characters playing, witha minimum bonusof 3inany case.

If onlyonenon-player character seesand accusesa characterof cheating, the lattercan only denythe chargeandaskfor satisfactionina duel. Being canght cheatingisas goodas being expelled fromthe club, so disconrageit. A cheat permanently losesall status withthe upper classandis ostracized fromall social contact.

Any attemptat cansing tronbleor pickinga fight here will resultin disasterforthe characters. The Castle Keepercan assumea forceof fighters (including knightsand guards) tobe three timesthe numberof characters involved, and with twiceas manyhit points collectively. If thereare spell castersinthe party, have more potent ones (whoare club members) on handto negateand counterthe character's castings. Donot makea fightofit, simply informthe players that their charactersare swiftly subdued, bound, gagged, and removedtothe city gaol with 10% of their normalhit points remaining. They willbe triedonthe followingdayfor Criminal Trespassing, Disturbingthe Peace, Battery, Disrespecttoa Nobleor Ecclesiastic, Assault, Assault witha Deadly Weapon, and possibly Endangering Propertybythe Careless Useof Magic. Atthe very leastthe characters will eachbe fined 500gpand havetopayforall damages they causedinthe club (See Part I, The Cultureof Yggsburgh, Crime & Punishment). Alternately, the Castle Keepercandothe battle, but much preparation wouldbe necessaryand referencetothe Ordersof Battle Appendix requisite. Inall likelihoodthe result willbethe same.

fingersare tipped with rather longand horn-like nails. Hehasa wispy beard similarto thatofanold mandarin, andhis eyebrows risein bushy wings above bright green eyes. His luxuriant eyebrows seemtobe attemptingto moveuphis domed foreheadto takethe placeofhis lost headof hair. He moves with feline grace despitehis years, andhis voiceis softbut strong, like thatofa youngman. His typical greetingis: "What bringsyoutomy worthless little shop, O Esteemed One?"

The Castle Keeper must manageallthe sellingand trade that takes place here. Junker sellsand buys strangeand curions objectsofoldand/or exotic sort thatarenot found elsewhere. These include weird picturesand figurines, strangely bound books, curios, small boxes with complex locks, stones with carvings upon them, insects trappedin amber, shrunken heads, mummified bats, small mechanical items, etc. He willpay from 5spto 50gpor more, asthe Castle Keeper decides, basedonthe item profferedfor sale.

When asked about magical items, he responds: "Afew I have kept safely away. Theyarenotfor sale, but I will trade themfor like items that have more appealtome. Whatdoyou wish, and what willyou offerin trade?" Of conrseany trade here willbeonein whichthe character concerned must give over moreto obtain lessin total value. For instance, Master Junker will tradea +3 longswordin returnfora +2 bastard sword, ora +3 short swordfora +2 dagger. Again, the Castle Keeper mustusehis ingenuityinall such bargaining. Several potionsand scrollsdonot equalany substantial magical object, buta potent wandand ring might. Remember, Waldo Junkeris shrewdand will alwaystryto profit fromany trade, asking initiallyat least three timesthe worthof whatheis willingto trade fromhis cacheof dweomered things. Heis never fooledby fakesor cursed items. He doesnot identify unknown magic items, buthe will offerto accepta valuableonein tradefor somethingof minor value-a magical draught, a scrollof spells, or some like item.

It goes without saying that this shop doesnot have every imaginable enchanted object. Which oneshe does possessisuptothe Castle Keeper. Wherea desired itemistoo potent, have Waldo offer something useful, but less powerful, in tradeforthe collectively more valuable magical objectthe characterhas offered. Wishing objectscan neverbehad from this shop.

The gronndand upper floorsare each half-occupiedbythe business, each shop havinga rear office, storage roomand back entrance. The onter door leadstoan interior staircase goinguptothe second story, wherethe proprietorofthe religions items store lives withhis familyofsix. The entire first flooristhe lodgingof Waldo Junker. Hehastwo vicions guard dogsas pets. Herehehasa locked strong room with magicaland mechanical traps, andinitare storedall enchanted itemsnot otherwise keptonhis person.

The basementis accessed only from inside Junker's shop, throngha trapdoorinthe back opening onto stairs. Thisisthe place Waldo storesallofhis excess inventoryof curiosand some larger items, suchasa dozen bizarre statuesand several very unusual golems. Heisnot averseto tradinga golemfor some more potent magical item, of course. Itisnot contemplated that successful lootingof this placecan occur, but should some foolhardy character attemptit, the Castle Keeper must devisethe most devionsand deadlyof trapsand dweomers aboutthe establishment which mustbe navigated. If attackedand hard pressed, Waldo Junker doesnot engagein handto hand combat, but summonsa genieto fightforhimand teleports awayas many hostile creatures fromhis shopas possible.

This plaintwo-story buildingis occupiedbya colorfuland loquacions gnome businessman withan unusual magical item. Unlessit'soneofthe days Gnigul Butterbotham makeshis regular Dunfalcon journey, thereisa 50% chance Gniguland Bork Craigs willbeinthe residence; otherwisea thinbut rather comely halfling woman named Samantha Pangia willbe thereto serve customers.

Gnigul Butterbotham doesn't adventure anymore, nor willheor Bork Craigs servein this capacity other thanto transportand defendhis boatand passengers.

Hehastwo regular weekly scheduled trips fromthe Yggsburgh area.

Outsideof this, heis openfor special deliveriesand travel services. Inthe Yggsburgh area, aristocratsand wealthy gentry tendto hirehis services frequently.

Gnigul offers customersthe services described below. He chargesa fair pricefor this extremely convenient service, althoughhe also sometimes does charity workforthe peasant classeswho liveinthe area, along with some favorsforthe gnomesinthe vicinity.

Gnigul doesn'task many questions, although activities that carrya severe legal penaltyand/or conflict withhis personal moralityhemay refuse-for instance, no slave trading. He doesnot travelat night, soany trips mustbe done within sunupto sundown. Thus, ifhe's hiredfora "day trip," the farthesthe willgois about 300 miles. He doesnot offer himselffor long-term excursions.

The bank will loanno more than 50% ofthe actual valueofthe security given over, that basedonthe owner's equityinthe security. For example, a property worth 50,000gp, for whichthe title deed holder still owed 20,000gp, would havean equityof 30,000gp; a loanof 30,000gp against that equity wouldbe questionable, so most banks would allowno more than 15,000gp. Onthe other hand, a valuable magic item given overtothe bankis consideredas 100% owner equity, so 50% ofits cash sale value willbe loaned.

He alsohas several spell books, whichthe Castle Keeper should fleshont, bearingthe following advicein mind: the Castle Keeper should supply this malign fellow with whatever other magical thingshe might needto makehis defeatbythe characters most difficult. But, inall such cases, remember thatifheis overcome, the characters will gainthe benefitof such thingsif theyare multi-use, so keep those kindsof thingstoa minimum.

#### Mound Island **Location: Mound Islandin Bigfish Lake

**Encounter **Chart: Lake Encounters

**Zagyg Adventure Reference: Big Fish Lake, Garham

The characters will undonbtedly learn that Mound Islehasabad reputation. Fishermen willnotply their trade neartoit, and onlyafew youngand daring folkso muchasset footonthe island during daylight hours. Itis well known that thereare dangerous things dwelling there. Talesof rashand foolhardy treasure hunterswho venturedto Mount Isleto findthe River King's Tomband lootit, nevertobe seen again, are commonly toldin many places-the town properandinthe tavernsand innsof smaller communities aroundit.

**Mound Island**

This islandis aboutoneanda half miles longanda quarterofa mile across. Ithas rocky shores that rise from sevento 12 feet abovethe water surronndingit, and thereare onlytwo placesonthe isleto beacha boat. The main areaisatits western (downstream) end wherethe landis lowest. Here, thereisa V-shaped beachof large pebblesand small bonlders thatis about 50 yards deepand 100 yards across whereit meetsthe treelineofthe islandtothe east. There, the bedrockof Mound Isleis inclinedand only aboutonetotwo feet abovethe beach, so moving fromthe open beachtothe island interioris easy. Thereis alsoa small coveon South shore, it being abouta thirdofa mile fromits eastend (upstream) end. The coveis half-moon shaped, 100 feet acrossand indentsthe shoreline about 50 feet. Its center portionhasa muddy beach some 40 feet long, this giving ontoa shallow ravine running inland, northwardsuptothe spineofthe central ridge. In heavy rainthe ravineis flooded, and anyone conghtinit will likelyby swept underthe torrentand drowned.

The whole islandis thickly overgrownby trees. Atits shore thereisa profusionof smaller foliage-grass, weeds, small shrubs, bushes, and small varietiesof trees ringingthe central woods. The islandhasatits centera long ridge witha rounded crest, andthe trees growupits sidesand atop this prominence, saveinafew places where formationsof bare rockjutont. becauseofthe heavy vegetationand rongh ground, movementonthe islandis slowand difficult. It takes three honrsor more from move fromoneendtothe other, and nearlyan honrto crossits breadth becauseofthe central spine.

**History**

Thisis what they will discoverin their research regarding Mound Isleandthe River King.

Three centuries beforethe lands here were civilized, a numberof fierceand barbaric tribes dwelledin this region. The most powerfuland fearedof these tribeswas calledthe Cnobrii, and their lands encompassed mostofthe territory that surrounds Yggsburgh. The Cnobrii were able river sailors, and usedthe Nemoand other streamsto carry their warriorsfarand wideto raidand plunder. Their lastand greatest chief styled himselfas 'the River King." His actual nameis lostto history, buthis wealthand crueltyare legendary. The treasurehe amassedbyhis cruel raiding made rivals mount campaigns againstthe Cnobrii, sothe wealth bronghtno peaceor prosperitytohimandhis people. although manyofthe slaves capturedbythe tribe were sacrificedtoa malign deity their great chief honored, the bloodshedwastono avail, andin timethe lossof Cnobrii warriorswas such thatthe tribewas near extinction. In desperation, the River Kingandthe lastofhis folk made Mound Islea fortress, and thereisit said they constructeda placefor performingthe darkestof evil ritesto evoke demonicaid. Atthe last battlethe River King tookallofhis hoardof wealth, and withthe wholeofthe tribe entombed themselvesin this subterranean place. Those foeswho attemptedto enter afterthe Cnobrii were thrown back, and then great rocks closedthe entrance. Thus endedthe dreaded Cnobrii tribeand their terrible ruler.

No search sincehas discoveredthe locationoftheso-called tomb, although many expeditions have searchedforiton

Mound Isle. Fewof thoseso engaged have livedto tellof their undertaking. It seems that some curseis activein that place, and surely some fell guardianor guardiansare activein keepingthe buried place inviolate. Asthe treasure buried thereis beyond imagination, thereare still occasional forays ontothe islandby treasure hunters, the last knownone conducted onlya year before this entrywas written. Ofthe 50 persons involved, three returnedto Yggsburgh. They were discovered floating downthe riverina rowboat. All died withinafew daysof their rescue. The only words spokenbythe strongestofthe three, a ranger, wereas follows:

_"(Moaningin semi-conscions nightmare recollection)_ _'The shadowsare alive! They hide things worse than _they _are, _lads-retreat! _If _they _catch _us _we _are doomed... _Gods, _the _dead _ones _can _follow _us _into _the sunlight. _There's _no _hope. _Every _man _for _himself_

**Yggsburgh Library**

The following what character's will discoverin their research regarding Mound Isleandthe River Kinginthe Natural History Sectionofthe Yggsburgh Library.

_"Thereis saidtobea most unusual speciesof Kobold dwellingon Mound Isle. Therehas beenno proofof their existence, but locals claim that these humanoidsare especially elusiveand dangerous. Supposed Encounters withthe Kobolds include incidents where they wereinthe river, swimming like otters, attacked from below without warning. Lacking actual physical evidence, one must conclude thatthe attacks were actuallythe workof otters, and strong drink._

**Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh** _The samecanbe saidforthe intelligent raccoons _of Mound Isle, supposedly creatures thatuse bowsand arrowsto attack trespassersinthe island. No such _species _has _been _discovered _or _even _seen _bya reputable person, sowe must conclude thisis another tall tale spunforthe amusementofthe yokelsand credulons folk."_

**College Library**

Ifthe characters havea member ableto utilizethe College Library, that individual willbe ableto discoverthe following information regarding Mound Isle froma student's paper regarding unusual local fauna.

_Much mystery surrounds Mound Isle. Of interestin regards aberrant local faunaare reportsof raccoon-like creatures inhabitingthe island. Several verbal reports assert that these unusual raccoonsare intelligent tool users witha deadly bent, plying bowsto attackand slayany humans_ _who _trespass _upon _their _island. _There _might _be _some_ _correlation _between _the _raccoon _stories _and _claims thatan unusual speciesof Kobolds inhabit Mound Isle. Itis unfortunate thatthe actual factscannotbe determined becauseofthe dangersof exploringthe island. Whether these perils spring from some ancient _curse _related _to _the _legendary _River _King's Tomb, aberrant raccoons, humanoid inhabitants, or some combinationof theseand other factorsis immaterialtothe dead researcher..."_ **Mound Island Dungeon**

The characters searchingforthe underground area will needto attainthe central portionofthe north shoreof Mound Isle, then begin exploring inwards some distanceto reachthe vergeofthe ridge that runsits length. As this occurs, they will notean areaof tumbled rockand stunted trees that enablesa clear viewofa sheer stone faceonthe ridge, it being some 300 feet long northeastto sonthwest, 30 feet highinthe central portion, slopingto about 20 feet heightat eitherend. Inthe central portion thereisan area clearedof detritus. Thisis shownonthemapas 1, the entrancetothe underground excavation.

For complete statisticsofnew monsters found hereinthe Game Masteris referredtothe Appendix G, Monstersof Yggsburgh. The keysto various dungeon localsand specificsare detailed below.

The stoneis dampanda strange formof lichen growsin scattered patchesonthe floors, ceilings, and wallsof these tunnelsat intervalsof around 30 feet.

They canse 1-3 pointsof damagebutare also slathered witha poison witha challenge level 2 that canse 2-12 pointsof damage unlessa save versus poisonis made, in which case they canse 1-6 pointsof damage. These bowsare suitableforuseby halflingsor gnomes, buttoo flimsyfor other racesto employ.

Each degenerate pygmy warriorhas 12 poisoned arrowsatthe beginningof each Encounter, so some unused ones mightbe recoveredifthe characters reachthetopofthe cliff, searchfor bodiesand find them. They possess nothing elseofuseor value.

1. **Rocky Bluff (described above) The cleared area allowsthe viewofa tunnel openingto broad stairs down running east intothe solid rock. Beforethe entranceare piled bones, skulls, and skeletons-a heapas wideasthewayinand about waist high. Theseare nothingbut remains, althoughthe characters will likely expect that theyare goingto become animated skeletons.

Inthe foliageatthe edgeofthe cliff above thisare concealedsix degenerate pygmy warriors armed with short bowsand poisoned arrows.

Anyone familiar with masonry will note thatthe mortar holdingthe stonesisoldand crumbly. Thereisa holeof some half-foot squareatthe left sideofthe baseofthe wall. This openingis sufficientfora degenerate pygmyto wiggle through, but small demi-humans willnotbe likely ableto pass unless theyare slenderandnot taller than three feet. Of course, the wallcanbe broken downby proper toolsor blunt weapons, butthe noiseof this activity will bring pygmy warriors from areas 3, 7, and 12-13.

Thereis much miscellaneons personal gear (woven baskets, gourds, etc.), and various foodstuffs (dried fishand meat, some rootsand berriesin skin bags, woven basketsandbig clam shells containers). Thereare 30non-combatant juvenile pygmies herein additiontothe maleand female warriors. These young pygmies will havein their possession 12 large freshwater pearls, all badly chippedand valueless.

Theisa shaman also. Hehasa small skin "medicinebag" aroundhis neck. It contains bonesand teeth from undead creatures (see belowfor effects).

When hearing intruders breaking downthe stone barrierinthe tunnel, ten pygmy warriorsandone chief will hasten forthto attackthe enemy, as another like force stays backthe angleofthe passage, their numbers strungontso thatthe lastisinthe antechamber areato relay informationtothe chiefandthe othersinthe main area. Ifthe intruders beatthe attacking forceof pygmies, these warriors holdthe passageway, whilethe shaman opensthe secret doorto areas 8and 9, summons forththe inhabitantswho arrive 10 rounds after theyare called.

The shaman needsno spell books, but behindthe secret doorto area 10inthe east wallhe keepsa small wicker hamper. In this containerhehas four potsof poison (2d6per application) that have sufficient substanceto applyto 36 weapons each. He makesupthe poisonona regular basis, asit losesits potency afterone month. To gainthe main ingredient, the shaman mustbe underwaterforan extended periodof time gathering slime fromthe underground "lake" in areas 14-19. Thus thereisa gourd flaskinthe hamper that containsa concentrated water breathing potion, the eight onncesof fluidit containsare sufficientto enable eight personsto breath normally when underwaterforuptotwo honrsof time each.

1. **Small Underground Lake The main bodyofthe water (14) is about 180' widetothe east, 90' across northto South, and from 20' to 70' deep. Itisfed from underground springsand flowsonttothe River Nemo through area 19. Thisis wherethe degenerate pygmiesdo fish "farming."

Inthe wateratthe edgeof area 13are what appeartobesix small floats like those usedfor seine nets.

#### The Salt Mines **Location: Serpent Ridge

**Encounter **Chart:** Hills

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Serpent Ridge, River Nemo, Purple Tower Road, Dunfalcon, Yggsburgh College

The first Lord Yggs, Franz, discovered salt alongthe westendofthe Serpent Ridge. He ordered diggingto commenceand soona whole stratumofthe mineralwas uncovered. The mine produceda fair quantityof pure sodium chloride. The income from this enabled Lord Yggsto become wealthy. Sincethe initial discoverythe minehas been enlarged, and continuesto produce excellent saltin large quantities. The operationisa monopolyof Yggsburgh. The minenow produces about 10 tonsof salt eachday, mostof whichis sent downthe River Nemo, for salein Dunfalcon Cityor export from thereto other urban centers. The saltis mainlyforusein preserving food, andsoisin high demand.

The mineis workedby convicted criminals sentencedto penal servitude. If they perform wellin their labors, the time spent miningis conntedas donble, effectively reducing their sentenceby halfif they work hard. Thereare some 30 felons laboringinthe mine. These convictsare underthe supervisionoftwo gnome mining engineers, and guardedby soldiersand prisoner trustees. The gnome supervisorsareon duty during working hours, asarethe trustees. Thereare alwaysat leasttwo halberdiersand crossbowmenon duty.

**Adventure Hook**

Sagesat Yggsburgh College have found mentionofthe Serpent Ridgeinanold text. The work claims that ancient peoples dwelling hereabonts worshipeda serpent deityand thus heldthe ridgeas sacred. This account mentions that primitive shamans builta secret placeof sacrifice somewhere alongthe ridgeand sacrificed many innocent peopleto honor that malign serpent. Itis claimed thatthe spiritsof those sacrificial victims cannot rest untilthe altar stoneis broken.

The detailsof this adventureareuptothe Castle Keeper, but ghostsand other manifestationsofthe departedare likely actorsinthe drama created. Therearetwo possibilities. First, the altar stone couldbe hiddenina mound nearthe salt minesand protectedby evil worshipersofthe serpent deity. Recent encroachmentsbythe miners have causedthe current worshipersto take action, orthe miners have disturbedthe spiritsofthe sacrificial victimswhonoware taking their tollonthe miners. Another possibilityis thatthe miners have uncoveredan altarinthe salt minesand have thus releasedthe sonlsof those victims. Further, a cabalof evil worshipersinthe surrounding area, or Yggsburgh, has also cometo investigate.

#### The Hidden Message **Location: The four Tors

**Encounter **Chart:** Hills

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Yggsburgh College,

More thanone scholarhas wonderedatthe four strange round hills comprisingthe four Tors. Noting thatasone progresses fromthe highesttorinthe northtothe smallestinthe South, the height differenceof eachis 45 degrees less thanthe previons. Isit coincidence, ordothe number four, the direction north, the height differences, and their individualor collective elevations, have some arcane meaning? Conple their noted qualities withthe fact that lightning strikes them with inordinate frequency, and many seeking occult lore believethe four Torstobeof special importance, a mystery waitingtobe solved, hidden knowledge revealed. Itisnot mere coincidence! Oneofthe portalsofthe Hidden Portal Nexusis locatedonthe highestand northernmosttorina cave

The Hidden Portal Nexusisan extraordinary gronpofsix portals thatall accessa nexus dimension. These portalsare virtually undetectable, savefora faint shimmeringof colorinthe areaas noted hereafter. The portalscanbe fonndatthe following locations. The colorof each dimensional door's radiance noted afterits location.

1.1. 	Nearthetopofthe highesttorofthe 4 Tors, ina small cave-azure.
1.1. 	Ina small groveofash trees very near Castle Zagyg- ochre.
1.1. 	Ina stony gulley behindan onthonseina peasant villageinthe Westfields-ruby.
1.1. 	Deep withinthe Wychwood forest, nexttoa deadyew tree-emerald.
1.1. 	Ona small, rocky isletin Bigfish Lake, about 800 yards fromthe shoreof Garham-mauve.
1.1. 	Deep withina gnome mine undergronndinthe Goldwood-amber.

Eachof these portals leadstoa circular chamberof 20-foot diameter-likely another dimensional matrix-withsix archways, all glowing withthe colors indicated above. Whenan individual, or gronp entersoneofthe portals, the archway they came thronghis inactive, leaving themto chooseoneofthe other five ways. The usercan stayinthe chamberfor five minutes only; otherwiseall withinthe chamberare sucked intooneofthe portalsat random.

Magiccan work herebutitis unableto escape this spacevia dimensional travel, sendor receive communications ontsideit, summon creatures, or damageor alterthe wallsor portalsinanyway. This leadsafew sagesto believe this spaceisa pocket plain composedofa conceptual dimension.

The chamber also seemsto have some sortof time isolation effect. Peoplewho spendafew minutesinthe chamber, then entera portal appear exactlyatthe time they went thronghthe first portal. Thosewho have experimented with this have found thatiftwo people enter different portalsatthe same time, theydonot meet each otherinthe chamber, andthe same thing occursifone person entersthe portal, andthe second person enters aftera minute passes.

The portals were initially discoveredby young studentsat Yggsburgh College about 50 yearsago, and today thereisa small clandestine fraternityonthe campus whose secret includes knowledgeofthe portals. becauseof this, the college facultyin general, and someofthe town aristocratstoo, know about these portals, though they keep thisin strict confidentiality. Itis likely thatthe Thieves' Guild, afew bandit gronps, and perhaps some other individuals might know about these dimensional portals, but thatis uncertain.

Nobody knowswho created these portals, thoughafew sagessayit doesn't seemtobea creationof Zagyg, as theyare predictableand ordered.

**Adventure Hook**

Ifthe characters find referenceto this loreinthe library's special reference roomor discoverit through Yggsburgh College, perhaps theycan discoveran answeror eventhe locationofthe hidden portal nexus. The Castle Keeper must determine what answerthe characters actually find. Is this mere chance? Is there ironorein these great hills? Are hidden artifacts buried beneath them? Are there portalsto other planes hidden atop them? Isita combinationofallthe above? Theseare onlyafewofthe many possibilities opento development.

Therearetwo possible waysto prevent their depredations. Theycanbe attackedand eliminated, or theycanbe parleyed with, perhaps convincedto return northwards witha promise thatthe monster which drove themont willbe slainbyan adventuring party.

The typeand numberof humanoidsis leftuptothe Castle Keeperto decide. Referencingthe Ordersof Battle Appendixfor goblins, orcs, gnolesor others allowsthe Castle Keeperto createa goblinororc tribe whichcan thenbe usedfor this adventure. Likewise, the typeof monster that chasedthe humanoidsontof their homelandis best leftuptothe Castle Keeper, butitis suggesteda green dragon (whohasno lairbutis, rather, in searchofone) or bandof hill giants (also havingno lair) be used.

Yggsburgh cannot take direct action against Edgar, as that wouldbe sufficientfor Talworthto declarewar, and thenallofthe free town's foes would descendon Yggsburgh.

22. Invasion

The Dire Forestisa most dangerous place, asis impliedbyits name, especiallyinthe western portion. Theold hardwoods havea thick canopy, makingita dark place evenin daylight. This darkness allowsforfew normal plantsor common animalsto grow hereor graze beneathits bonghs.

Its sonthwestern edge (that portion visibleonthemap) marksthe westernand sonthmost bonndaryofthe landsofthe Marquisof Talworth. This areais underthe controlofoneofthe Marquis' leigemen, the darkand malign Waldgraf Horst Reindmann. Even thoughhe maintains clearings, and sends forth partiesof woodcutterstocut treesin certain partsofthe forestandto clear places such that they become more hospitable, the Waldgraf's portionofthe forestis scarcely more hospitable thanthe rest. The Waldgrafhasa stronghold adjacenttoa small thorp deepinthe Dire Forest. Itis difficultto access from anywherebutthe Marquisof Talworth's lands. He maintainsa small garrisonatthe fortress.

This latterisa dangerous assignment. Fell creatures resistthe intrusionofthe woodsmenand other travelers, playing havoc withaxe-men, armed guardsand others. Also, some unnatural force seemstobeat work, cansingthe undergrowthto springup quickly. Even saplings have been knownto growto become thigh- thick treesina yearor less. This, anda fearofthe sentient treesand plants saidto inhabitthe woods, makesthe whole placeone thatis shunnedby preference.

Ifhe continues with this masqueradeand succeeds, the wholeofthe area will fall underhis sway. Whatthe ranger doesnot know, is that Reindmann then plansto assassinatethe Marquisof Talworthand take overthe wholeof that march. Whenhe commandsall this, the fateof Yggsburghandits territoryis certain.

The adder alders makeupan onter ring aroundthe cave entry. They stand about 20 feet apartor more. Between eachisa 10x 20-foot patchof grabgrass.

The Glittering Knobsare richin minerals. Thereare many minesinthe region takingont gold, silver, copper, lead, garnetand quartzgem crystals. The oldestofthe minesareinthe northern, unforested portion, where such operations have been operatingfor several centuries, and mostofthe diggings thereare playedontand abandoned. Onlyafeware still workedby dwarfand gnome miners ableto findanddigont small veinsoforeand other minerals.

Thereare four large minesinthe region. Each produces, ona monthly basis, an average 50,000gpin ingotsand worked gemsat market value. These yieldsare carted, loadedon barges, and sent downthe River Nemoata costof 10% ofthe market valueofthe minerals, and bonghtby five factors (gold, silver, copper, lead, and gems), inthe townat 60% value. The factors' operating profitis only about 10% after overhead costsand taxes, but that leaves 5000gp monthlynet income, divided between them, for onlyoneofthe demi-human mines.

Elsewhereinthe Glittering Knobs, various minersand pannersare takingont reasonable amonntsof gold, silver, copper, lead, andgem crystals. about 20 minesanda handfulof lone panners producean average monthly incomeof 20,000gp eachfor their minerals, at market valuefor their refined/finished material. That comesto 400,000gpin value whenallis done, twicethe demi- human mines' yieldin finished product. Gold dustand nuggets, uncut crystals, andraworeare carted from hill locationsto river barges that carrythe mineralsto Yggsburghfor refining, casting into ingots, coins, and other working suchas cuttingand settingforgem minerals.

The Castle Keepercan assume that manyofthe minersare able combatants-fighters, rangers, and thievesof moderate level. Hereisa rosterfor dwarven, gnomishand human miners.

**Mines**

Assume thereare 40 minesand mining operations, halfof whichare active, and that halfofthe active onesare producing gems, gold, or silver. That givesa 1in 4 chanceof findinga minein which there willbea hidden repository containing 100-400gem crystalsof base 50gp value each, or else goldoreof 10,000to 80,000gp value, or silveroreof 5,000to 100,000gp (d20x 5,000gp) value. Unprocessedoreis basicallyalotof broken-up rocks, of course, and will needtobe transportedtothe River Nemoand soldtoa factor's agent there. Ifthe copperand lead minesare considered, their minedore willbe even bulkierandas heavy, witha valueof 5,000to 40,000gpand 5,000to 30,000gp, respectively.

**The Cursed Mine**

This mining complexis designedfor charactersof moderate level. A partyof 4th-6th level adventurers should fare well. shoulda higheror lower level party enterthe mines, simply reduceor increasethe numberof opponents encountered, theirhit points, armor classes, or evenhit dice.

The Cursed Mineisfar from playedont. Onthe contrary, itis fullof veinsof goldore. Itis also filled with gray dwarves, various monsters, anda connivingand unscrupulons elder xorn thathas 'mind powers' like thoseofthe Gray Dwarves, only superior. The exact locationofthe mineis leftinthe handsofthe Castle Keeper. The diggingsare generallyinthe north central portionofthe Glittering Knobs, ontof sightofthe River Nemobutnottoofar distant fromit. Whatis aroundthe minecanbe whateverthe Castle Keeper wishes. Information regardingthe Cursed Minecanbe gainedbythe adventurersin many ways. Severalare listed below.

Meetingand conversing withany residentsofthe Glittering Knobs/Goldwood area will reveala great amonntof information.

**Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh**

In conversing about prospectingor mining opportunities withany mining-connected businessman, much informationcanbe gained. These include bankers, any officialofthe town that deals with revenues, anore hauler (barge owneror hand), ora chance-met prospectoror miner (especiallya dwarfor gnome).

The Yggsburgh College libraryhas some informationinthe section containing works that deal with local folkloreand legends. Also, ina text dealing with mineral resonrcesisthe following information aboutthe Cursed Mine:

_Thereare no_ _working minesinthe northern portionofthe Glittering Knobs, that sectionofthe hillsnot coveredbythe Goldwood. Thisisnotto _say therearenot valuable mineral resonrcesin this place. Onthe contrary, some _two _decades _back _a gold strikewas made thereby dwarven miners. They _named _their _shaft _the Abounding Lode because _ofthe nearly pure veinof gold they were following. about _three _years _later _the dwarves disappeared, and whenitwas apparent theyhad abandoned _their claimand werenot coming back, gnomes _moved _in _to _exploitthe _mine. _They _bronght _onta considerable amonntoforeinthe several months they _worked _the _digging,_

_then _they _too _disappeared. _When _it _was _apparent_

_that _the _gnomes _had _also _pulled _up _stakes _for some reason-no evidenceof fonl playwas ever discovered, andin both casesthe minewas simply abandoned-human miners steppedinand began work _there. _They _lasted _only _a _week, _then _vanishedashad those before them._

_Rumors aboutthe Abounding Lode mine were common afterthe original crewof dwarves went missing. _When _the _gnomes _also _vanished, _the _stories proliferated _and _became _more _gruesome. _After _the third mining team disappeared, _leaving _not _a _clueas _to _what _happened _to _them, _the _place _receivedanew name: the Cursed Mine. Supposedly several other partiesof would-be minerswho songhtto exploitthe diggings overthe nextfew years were never _heard _from _again. _This _made _the _new _name_ _takeonan even more ominons tone thatwas sufficient _to _disconrage _even _the _hardiest _of _miners. The whole areahas been shunned ever after. Prospectors avoidthe bald knobs there, swearing that _something _dark _and _dreadful _now _makes _themits home, issuing forth fromthe abandoned mine _to creep thronghthe darkness, huntingforany trespassersand carrying themoff without leavinga trace._

Inany friendly dealings witha knowledgeable memberofthe Thieves' Guild, especiallyonewhois involvedin smugglingor other river-connected activities, informationofa different typeis yielded. To loosenthe tongue, several drinks shouldbe bonghtand coins exchange hands. If doneso properly, the following informationcanbe learned:

_Thereare still dwarvesinthe supposedly cursed mine. Howdo I know? Ah, that's easy. One-Eyed Billy takesa loadof suppliesupthe Nemo every month, he does. Heandhis boys packsthe stuffup intothe hills, leavethelotatthe mine entrance, where some mean-lookin' dwarf pays' emoff with gold ingots. They pays triple valueforthe grain, hops, livestock, and ordinary stuff like flour, salt, and vegetables, plus 50gppermanfor delivery- donble thatfor Billy's services._

**Background**

A companyof dwarven prospectors discoveredan exposed veinof goldinthe northern Glittering Knobs some 38 yearsago. They wentto work diggingont excellentore. Soon theyhada lateral mine shaftdug, and discoveredthe vein playedont. They werenot disconragedby this, asthe mineral matrix promised more gold. They were encouraged, and actually used mostof their accumulated wealthto recruit moreof their fellows, and kept digging. Aftera year their activities were notedby othersinthe region, promptingthe leaderofthe dwarvesto registera claimin Yggsburgh. This meantthe miners would haveto send their goldoreto Yggsburgh, but wouldnot haveto worry about claim jumpers stealing their mine. The official operationsinthe "Abounding Lode" thus beganabit overa year afterthe dwarveshad actually begun work there. Their increased numbers meant thatthe miners could expand their work, andso multiple tunnels were hewn fromthe rock, all mainly lateralasthe veinsofore were thus positioned.

However, one veintothe east northeast angled downwards, soa shaftwasdugto followit. Aftera yearit playedont, but traces were fonndtothe north. Following those, the dwarves fonndthe vein resumed again, now angling downandtothe east. This they followed. Eventually they broke intoa natural cavernin whicha large poolof waterwas discovered.

This great grottohada natural passage leading eastwardstoa whole complexof passages, caves, and caverns. The dwarves sealedthe natural passage with rocks, thinkingto keep whatever denizensofthe subterranean maze thatlay beyondontof their prosperous mine. That effort succeededfor onlya relatively short time. The workofthe dwarveswas discoveredbya clanof gray dwarves. Thesesly consinsofthe miners removed mostofthe rocks, soasto enterthe diggingsand investigate.

Using their mental powersto blindthe ordinary dwarvesto their presence, the gray dwarves soon assessedthe mineasa great prizeandone well worth some killingto gain. Wordwas sent backtothe clan, andthe warriorsofthe Dark Delvers infiltratedthe diggingsto attack. They made sureto pickoff gangsof miners separatelyto avoid fightinga large pitched battle. Inafew hours they managedto slaughter everyoneof their consins. The gray dwarves deemed enslaved workersnot likelytobe efficientbut likelyto canse tronble. Ifa singleone escaped, their game wouldbeupand other dwarves would cometo drive themoff. Asa result, none were spared.

Thus, the dwarves "disappeared" andthe gray dwarves wentto work diggingontthe veinsof goldthe former ownershad

**The Environsof Yggsburgh**

discovered. Their chief, Druganthe Hammer, was much pleasedas little ingotsof bullion accumulatedinhis personal hoard. Therewasno grumbling fromhis clansfolk either, asthe minewasso rich that eventhe avaricions chief couldnot begrudge ample sharesof this vast wealthtohis clansmen.

Beingso greata prize, these thieves were carefulto guard against other robberswho might come fromthe ontside worldtolay claimtothe mine. That precantionwas well-founded. Inafew short months, a gangof gnomes came trudginguptothe entranceofthe mineand sent scont teams insideto exploreit. Being suspicions (becauseofthe disappearanceofthe dwarves) the gnomes werenot takenby total surprise. Warnings from sconts enabledthe gnomesto ready themselvesfor invisible opponents. A fightwashad. Itwasa longand bloodyonebut, intheend, the gray dwarves slewthelotof them, taking some considerable losses themselvesinthe process.

Rather than seek replacements, the gray dwarves decidedto keepthe mineto themselves, thus having larger sharesof gold. Again, their chief, Druganthe Hammer, stationed lookontsfornew intruderswho might steal into their mine.

When gronps cameto claimthe "abandoned" mine, they were each less numerons thanthe gnome explorershad been. These gronps were allowedto penetrate well intothe diggings before being ambushedand slaughteredbythe gray dwarves. Afew prisoners from each unfortunate party were takenandputto workas slaves. Thus, things seemedtobe going well indeedforthe murderons interlopers. In time, there werenonew would-be claimants appearing, the slaves diedoff from overwork, andthe malign dwarves were alone with their ever-growing hoardof gold.

Then things changed. An aberrant elder xorn, burrowingfor tasty minerals, came uponthe underground lake, sensedthe rich aromaof pure gold, and began exploringthe cavernsandthe mine shaft leading fromit.

The elemental creaturewas filled with muchjoy (as muchasits kindis capableof feeling) whenit detectedthe thonghtsofthe gray dwarves. They were easily managedbythe xorn'sown mind, asthetwo possessed similar mental prowess-butthe gray dwarves' powers were inferior. Thus, they were subjecttothe xorn's illusionsand suggestions, and quite incapableof discovering that they were being manipulated.

After observing them unseenfora time, the mineral elemental workedonta plan. The elder xorn appearedtothe chiefofthe gray dwarvesinthe forma golden deity, naming himself Thaarl Goldhandand claimingtobea mighty gray dwarfof supernatural powerand awesome majesty. The xorn workedhis illusions. Druganthe Hammer becamea believerina hurry, andall donbts were shredded whenthe disguised aberrant elder xorn introducedhis "servants," earth mephitsand small salamanders.

Since then, the gray dwarves havehadan easy time smeltingore, thanksin large parttothe salamanders. These elemental creatures have even been heatingthe gray dwarves' brewing vatsto boilingto help makeale. As orderedby their chief, and under supervisionofthe earth mephits, the gray dwarves bring their ingotsof gold

**Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh**

tothe shrineof Thaarl Goldhand wherethe "deity" blesses them that they might growin weight. The bullionis then cast intothe depthsofa great pool ontsidethe shrinefor safekeeping.

That's whatthe gray dwarves believe, anyway. In actuality, whenthe ingotsare placed beforethe idol, the "blessing" consistsofthe xorn sequesteringthe metalfor later consumption. Needlesstosay, this creaturehas grown very largeand what wouldbe called corpulentforan animal. The only goldthe gray dwarves have gainedfor their laboristhe tithe theyare permittedto keepas immediate reward.

**The Mines**

All 10-foot-wide shaftsinthe mines have rongh-hewn floorsand walls, and arched ceilings that, at their apex, are 10 feet abovethe floor. The stoneis dampanda strange formof lichen growsin scattered patchesonthe floors, ceilings, and wallsat intervalsof around 30 feet. This stuffis knownas glowlichenandit emitsa faint blue light that enables visiontoa distanceof about 10 feetfor normal characters (similartothe light froma glowstick). Tunnels thatare 20 feet wide have ceilings that reachan apexof 15 feet.

An "E" indicates wherea shaft endsand digginghas stopped. Thereare obvions signsof drilling, chipped stone, cracked wall faces, anda litterof broken stoneonthe floor nearthe endsof these tunnels. Whenina deadend, the party willbe attackedbythe bats dwelling there.

Cave Bat x1-10+20 _(These creatures' vital statsare: HD 1d2, HP _1, _AC _12, _neutral. _Caee _bats _attack _by _swarmiug _exposed_ _portions _of _the _body. _Their _attacks _are _iu _gronps _of _fonr, _and _they_ _receiee _1 _attack _for _each _fonr _bats. _If _a _hit _is _scored, _1 _poiut _of_ _damageis iuflicted from scratchesand bites.

1. **Entrancetothe Abounding Lode Mine** From ontsideofthe minesto just beforethe tunnel jogs sontheast, thereisa foreshorteningofthe passagewayfor 90 feet. Afterthe party proceeds some 60 feet intothe mine entrance, theyseea flicker ahead, something like ghostly dwarves. Then suddenlythe partyhas crossbow quarrels whirring amongst themasthe gray dwarves unleasha volley. When they look again, theysee nothinginthe tunnel save darkness. After their initial volley, the attackers immediately retreat aroundthe bendinthe passage, become invisible, and separate.

Twoofthe gray dwarves then head northeastto alert their fellowsin that sectionofthe mine, while three head Southtodothe same there. Theone left behind peers aroundthe cornerand generatesan illusionofsixofhis kind. These reappearinthe passage firing crossbowsatthe party. Whenthe illusionis destroyed, he runsathis best speedtothe entranceto area 2, peers around that corner, and generatesthe illusionofsix more crossbow-armed gray dwarves. These illusions attackthe partyasthe previons onesdid. When these phantom imagesare destroyed, he hastensto joinhis fellowsin area 4.

Gray Dwarf, miner x6 _(HD _1d10, _HP _6, _AC _16, _Equipment _crossbow,_ _short sword, banded mail, iugot worth 10gp.

Of course thereisno traceofany "body" wherethe illusionwas thus destroyed.

1. **Inclined Passageway** The tunnels indicatedbya lineinthe middleofthe passageare inclined downwardtothe eastata gradientof abouttwo feet over five. Itisa noticeable slope. Running hereinbythe characters risksa chanceof stumbling, trippingor falling. A dexterity checkat -3is necessary when running downthe slopeto prevent falling. No damage will accruetothe character that falls, but anything heldin handhasa chanceof being dropped. Another dexterity check mustbe made, with failure indicatingany items heldare dropped. Anything droppedmay rollor scatter downthe hallway, requiringat leasta ronndto recover.
1. **Chamber This 30' x 30' chamberhasa 15' high ceiling. Thereisno glowlichenin this room. Waitingin this placeisan earth mephit-a lumpy, thin, and gangly gnome-like beast with wings. Itwas stationed herebythe aberrant elder xornasa remindertothe gray dwarvesofthe powerof their "deity." Of course this creature attacksthe party when they enterthe chamber.

The earth mephitis hovering abovethe floorat 10' height, just insidethe entry. It allowsthe first person enteringto pass unless theyseeit. It then attacksthe most likely targetinthe second rank withits breath weaponor whomever looksupatit. It then summons additional mephitsand flies downto attackthe initial character enteringthe chamber.

1. **Ledge This stone ledgeisof varying width, andone foot abovethe poolof watertothe east. Thereare patchesof glowlichen spread around this chamber. The entire cavernis approximately 80 feet acrossand 170 feet longatits greatest. The entranceto area 5 cannotbe seen fromany position exceptthe ledgeatthe entryor froma location abovethe waterandtoits north.

Thereare 15 gray dwarves waitingin hereto ambushthe party. Thereisa gronpof three waiting nearthe entry. The othersare divided intotwo gronps, with 5 minersanda leaderin each gronp. Theyare 20 feet fromthe entrance passage withone gronpon each sideofit. Whenthe whole partyisonthe ledge, they attack.

Asthe intruders have threatenedthe sacred placeof their "deity," the gray dwarves attack relentlesslyand without fearof death. They remain visibleand pressin from both sidestotryand forcethe characters intothe waterinthe hopes they will drown.

They will fight thustothe last. Anyoneof themnot engagedfora round will concentrateon creatingthe illusionofany fallen fellows jumpingupand returningtothe fray.

Ifthe party breaks thronghtothe South, the gray dwarves concentrateon creatingthe illusionof anaconda-like snakes emerging fromthe poolof water that then attackthe characters.

**4A. Underground Pool** This poolis 70' east-to-westand 150' north-to-South. The gray dwarves catchandeat many fish from this bodyof water. Phosphorescent plants growinginthe water enablethe observertosee some 40 feet intoit. Itis filled with fishof varying size. The largestof theseare mostlyred sunfish, platter crappie, and golden perchoftwo-footand more length, and weighingsixor more pounds. Smaller fish, the sizeof normal panfishon downto shunsand minnows, are also abundant.

The glitterof goldcanbe plainly seenbyany character looking intothe water fromthe entranceto area 5. It appears that thereisa small monntainof gold ingotsatthe bottomand just belowthe ledge. Thisis actuallya strong illusion createdasa permanent semblanceof bullionbythe aberrant elder xorn. The "ingots" are rocks. Onlyifa dispel magicis cast upon them, or when theyare takenontofthe mine, will their true naturebe revealed. Otherwise, it appearsasif thereare 10,000 little ingots each weighing 20 onncesand havinga presumed valueof 500gp each.

The supplies smuggledtothe gray dwarvesbythe Yggsburgh Thieves' Guildare kept here, along with other things gathered from ontsideor taken from victimsof this malign bunch. Thereare also small carts herefor movingoreto, and bullion from, the smelterin area 13. Thereare normallyno gray dwarves here, butthe aberrant elder xornhas placedan earth mephit hereto keep tabsonthe materialandthe dwarves.

Includedinthe cache willbe clothingofall sorts, and adventuring gear suchas backpacks, canteens, belts, belt ponches, coilsof rope, etc. Rations, wine, liquor, torches, oil, blankets, and like things will have been takenand usedbythe gray dwarves.

If alertedbythe chieforsub-chief from area 10, these dwarves willbe further alongin their arming process, possibly fully readybythe time anyone arrives here.

When pouring gold, the channelis openedtoruntothe westto filla mold thathas many small cavitiesfor formingupto 16 small, 10-ounce ingotsof gold. Any surplusand splashed goldis pickedupand tossed back intothe crucible. The floortothe westof this operationis littered with heapsof slag nearthe walls.

Presently, they have cast 16 ingotsandare ponringthe last batchof molten goldto make eight more. Two gray dwarvesare standingbyto carrythe cooled ingotstothe chief, whoin turn conveys themto Thaarl Goldhand, the aberrant elder xorn.

1. **Mine Thisisan areaof current active digging. A veinof goldis being followedbythe gray dwarves.
**Concludingthe Adventure**

Ifthe characters wishto claimthe Abounding Lode mine, the Castle Keeper should allowit, if that suits their plans. The characters will needto finda boss minerand crewtodothe digging, unless they planto mineit themselves. A boss minercanbe locatedin Yggsburghand will insist that, before takingonthejob, the claimbe registeredin Yggsburghto prevent continual attemptsby claim jumpersto take overthe diggings.

Registering their claimcan cost anywhere from 1gpto 25gp, atthe optionofthe Castle Keeper. The locationofthe claimand nameofthe mine willbe recorded along withthe owner's nameand placeof residence. The recording clerk will explain thatall gold-nuggets, dust, bullionorrawore mined-mustbe senttothe refineryin Yggsburghtobe handled. Paymentfor shipments willbeat 90% of valuefor.999 fine gold, less additional processing costs, ifany. Thiscanbeas highas 50% ofthe valueforrawore, oras littleas 10% for nuggetsand dust. Ingots willbe assayedand paidat 90% of their actual gold content. Failureto senda monthly shipmentof goldtothe town will resultin cancellationofthe claim rights, andthe town then owns those rights. Otherwise, Yggsburgh stands readyto enforcethe owners' rights whenever needed, usingits militarytodosoif necessary.

The mine yieldstothe owneranetof 40-160gpper monthfor every miner (uptoa maximumof 15) workingit. The mine boss steals onlythe moderate amonntof 25gpa month. The miners steal much less, perhaps 1sp worth each. It seemingly playsontin 5d10 monthsof time. Onlya mining engineer, or dwarfor gnome miner, willbe ableto locatenew veinsofore. If hired, theycan returnthe mineto 50% normal yieldfora periodof 6-60 years-it beingan excellent mine overall.

#### Settlersand Burrows **Location: Lonely Valley

**Encounter Chart: Open Grasslands

**Zagyg Adventure Reference:** Lonely Valley, Menhir Hills, Yggsburgh, Green Ridge, Urt River, The Gnome Burrows, Garham, Jolly Fisherman, Green Friends Clan, Yggsburgh College Library

**Villages **of **Note: Garham

The lonely valleyhasno roads leadinginorontofit. Its landsare unsettledbythe farmersof Yggsburghandfew humansare likelytobe seen here. The only folk that dwellin proximitytothe Lonely Valleyare (were-see below) a clanof gnomeswho have their burrowsinthe hillsatthe valley's north central edgeanda tribeof elvesinthe woodsatthe Southend. Neither gronp welcomes humans, forif settlers come intothe place everything will change drastically. The lord mayorof Yggsburgh would haveit otherwiseifhe could thinking thatthe additionofa roadandafew villages, twoor three knightsand Yggsburgh becomes that much strongerand more wealthy.

**Adventure Hook**

What bringsthe characterstothe Lonely Valley? Perhapsthe Lord Mayor requests thatthe characters surveythe Lonely Valleyfora likely spotto begin buildinga village, or sends themto make arrangement withthe gnomesand elvesfor settlement rights? Whateverthe case, the charactersare unlikelytobe received wellbythe elves, oratallbythe gnomes (see below).

**The Gnome Burrows**

The exact locationof this placeis leftinthe handsofthe Castle Keeper. The burrowsare generallyinthe hillsatthe west edgeof Lonely Valley. Whatis aroundthe locationcanbe whateverthe Castle Keeper wishes. Thisis very mucha dungeon crawl, with littleinthewayof role-play, and very much exploration with some hackand slash thereafter. What heroic party would really wantto spend time chatting witha bunchof murderons goblins anyway? Solet your players haveatitin this action-filled scenario.

**The Environsof Yggsburgh**

Information regardingthe Gnome Burrowscanbe gainedinanyofthe following ways:

**Lonely Valley:** When meetingand conversing withany persons dwellinginor familiar withthe Lonely Valley, the person will comment thatthe tribeof friendly gnomes that dwelledinthe west central hills borderingthe valley seemsto have gone elsewhere, and that wild animalsnow makethe area dangerous.

**Jolly Fisherman:** Whenin conversationinthe Jolly Fishermanale Housein Garham, andthe subjectof gnomes, herbs, orthe Lonely Valley comesup, informationcanbe gained. An individual comments thatthe gnomeswho inhabita burrowatthe valley's western verge have become hostileandwon't allow anyone near there anymore, soitis dangeronstogo there. They think somethingis definitely wrong.

**Green Friends Clan:** Ifthe charactersare friendly withany gnome dwellinginthe area, they express concern that somethingbadhas happenedtothe Green Friends Clan that dwellsinthe Lonely Valley. Why? becausethe gnomehas heard whispered remarks amongsthis fellows thatthe Green Friends would never have willingly ceased trading their herbsand mineralsforthe many goods theygot fromthe town.

**Yggsburgh **Herb **Suppliers: When discussing rare herbs withany supplierof samein Yggsburgh, that individual will complain that sincethe gnomesof Lonely Valley have stopped tradinginthe town, itis difficulttoget some kindsof rare herbs, and qualityisnotas highas those fromthe local gnome growers.

**Yggsburgh Spell Component Suppliers:** When discussing spell components withany supplierofthe samein Yggsburgh, the proprietor muttersin passing that sincethe gnomesofthe Lonely Valley quit sending their mineral componentstothe town, magnetiteand pyriteare difficultto comeby.

**Yggsburgh College Libray:** If researchinginthe Yggsburgh College library regardingnon-human occupantsofthe area, the following entry willbe discoveredina text dealing with demi- human gronpsinthe vicinityofthe town:

_Of _fairly _recent _introduction _into _the _region _is _a _clan_ _of gnomeswho call themselvesthe Green Friends. They _are _mainly _agriculturists _that _cultivate _herbsofall kinds, butare especially knownfor their abilityto grow rare herbsof exceptional potency. The _clan _is _small _and _reclusive. _The _location _of _their burrowis northwestofthe Townof Yggsburgh, inthe area knownasthe Lonely Valley._

**Forthe Castle Keeper**

The gnome clanofthe Green Friends numbered only 12 families, with 56 membersanda bachelor associationof 24 members. With their chiefandhis family, the clan priestandhis familyand warrior guards, the total number cameto around 100 clansmen. Despite their small number, the clanwas prosperousand lived well. In additionto their herbal crops, the gnomeshad discoveredan excellent sonrceof magnetite (lodestone) and pyrite, so they became relatively wealthy trading these goods.

**Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh**

Being insularin their ontlookand averseto general fraternization withany personsnotof gnomish heritage, the Green Friends enjoyed their isolated locationand keptall strangers, including other gnomes, away. Thisledto their undoinginthe recent past. A tribeof wandering goblins made theirway thronghthe Menhir Hills undetectedby humansor gnomes, and notedthe rich conditionsofthe Little Hillwoodand Long Forest timberlands, as wellasthe lushnessand gameinthe Lonely Valley. In seekinga hidden placeto make theirown, the goblins discoveredthe burrowsofthe Green Friends Clan. Asthe leadersof these humanoids were clever, they spiedonthe gnomes carefully before making their move. When they struck, the goblins ambushed sentries, taking prisoner many gnomeswho were workinginthe herb gardens, and then used their captivesto gain entrancetothe burrows. The gnomes were soon totally subduedand then killed.

The goblin chiefwasso pleased withhis success thathe namedhis bandthe Green Slayers, and their emblemisnowa gnome skull dyed green. However, becausethe goblinsarefewin numbernow, the chiefhas electedto enlist many wererats intohis force.

The shamanwas also quite happy, ashe discoveredthe meansof summoninga will-o'-wisp amidstthe booty taken fromthe demi- humans. A special potionwas discovered that gavethe shamanthe meansto controla summoned will-o'-wisp. Itisa gnomish potion made from rare herbs. He regrets being unableto makenew batchesofthe magical draughtbut keepson experimenting, the only resultssofar being three dead membersofthe band.

The main objectiveforthe partyis rather straightforwardand violent. Get intothe complex, and wipeontallofthe goblinsand their associated number. To makethe victory complete, they needto make known what they have done after accomplishingthe exterminationofthe vile goblins. This will gainthe party some renownand make them popular withall demi-humans, and gnomesin particular.

Ifyou wish, the scenariocanbe modifiedto allowfor dissension withinthe goblin clan, thereisasub-chiefwhocanbe establishedasthe headofa rebel force that will possibly fight withthe characters againstthe other goblinsif they play things correctly. This optional approachis introducedand explainedin pertinent Encounter areas. youare freeto employitornot, butifthe partyisnot particularly strong, itisthe bestwayto providea fair chancefor their succeedinginthe challenging seriesof confrontations they face.

Ifthe partyisof relatively high level, simply increasethe numberand/or levelof goblinsand other denizensof this place. Inall cases where goblinsare receivinga bonusto damage, that same bonus appliestothe attackdie roll.

**The Burrows**

**Compositionofthe Burrows**

The Green Friendsdug their home intoa hillside composedof limestone with pocketsof soil. Those areasofthe underground complex excavated from earthare indicated hereafterinthe Encounter areas. **Tunnels:** All five-foot-wide shafts have rongh-hewn floorsand walls, as wellasan arched ceiling eight feet abovethe flooratits apex.

**Doors:** Single doorsareof iron-bandedoak, two inches thick. Eachistwo-and-a-half feet wideand five feet high. All open inwardand havean iron boltto lock them. Donble doorsare studdedand iron-bandedoak, two-and-a-half inches thick. Eachis three-and-a-half feet wideand seven feet high. All open inwards, havean iron bolt, anda woodenbarto lock them.

**P: Theseare privy rooms with several accommodations. The waste shaftsrun some 40 feet downtothe channelofan underground stream.

**Approachtothe Entrance** The area surronndingthe entranceis sparsely wooded, with clumpsoflow foliageand bushes. The terrainis somewhat rockyand hilly, with many small ridgesand swales thatcut lineof sight considerably. Asthe party moves through here they notice small pathsinthe dirt, something like deer trails, butnot madeby hoofed animals. A ranger notes small footprintsof demi-humanand humanoid sort. The various paths lead awayto nothinginthe westand north, to overgrown garden patchesinthe east, andtoa slightly broader path leadingoff sonthwards intothe open landofthe valley. Backtracking alongthe paths leadsto Area 1.

1. **Entrance **to **the **Gnome **Burrows The well-beaten path leadstothe location whereit seemingly dead ends againsta sloping rockset intothe sideofalow hill covered with scrub. The rock slabis counter-weighted, so thata strong pull uponits lower edge cansesitto swing upwardsto revealan openingsix feet highand five feet wide, and stairs leading down intothe rock beyond.

The party will arrive either duringthedayor night. Each arrivalis described separately below.

**Daylight Arrival**

Asthe party comes closeto examinethe slabof stone, four gnomes concealedinthe bushes flankingthe rock standup with short bowsatthe ready, demandingto know what strangers dareto trespassonthe landsofthe Green Friends Clan.

The charactersmay notice that these demi-humansare rather beady-eyedand sharp-facedfor gnomes, and that theyare nervonsand twitchy. Observant characterssee that somethingis wrong.

These sentriesarenot eagerto engagein conversation, butifthe party appears tonghand determined, they will speakat some length. In general, they demand thatthe intruders leave, that their clanisin mourning overthe deathofits chief, andnoonenotofthe clancan enterthe burrows.

Theyare lying, of course. These gnomish wererats attackifthe partyis aggressive. These creatures will fight untiltwoare dead, thenthetwo remaining fleeat their fastest speedupthe hill intothe scrub. If they escape, thetwo enterthe escape passageonthe north sideofthe hill, whichis disguisedasafox'sden (see Area 2). They willnot alertthe goblins, because theyare cowardlyandnot loyalinthe least.

Thereare eight small bunk bedsin this room, each witha pairof wicker hampers stolen fromthe gnomes. The goblins keep their clothingand personal effectsin these containers, so thereis nothingof valueor interestin them other than 1-4 daggers each.

Tactics: The guards fight until dead evenif unarmored, as they knowthe penaltyfor failure. When noise alerts these goblins they will hastentoputon their armor, then leavethe roomonthe donble, and head directlyforthe guard postat Area 3, or else towardsany noiseor intruderswhoare visibleto them. The serjeantof this squad hurlshis caltrops down before advancing enemies, so thatany characters moving intothe area while attacking suffer 1d4 pointsof damage from steppingon them. A character suffering damage thus must spendthe following round pullingthe caltrop(s) ontor risk additional damage.

Rebel Faction Plot: Ifthe rivalryisput into play, you should assume thatthe shaman's apprenticeisin league withthesub- chief. In such casehe willdohis bestto seem activein fightingthe intruders, but actually withholdshis spellsto determineifthe rebel gronpis involvedinthe attack. Onlyif threatened with harm willheusehis spells againstthe party without knowingifthesub-chiefis allied with them. Ifhe seeshis fellow rebels fighting againstthe other goblins, he will then attackthe shaman.

Tactics: If fightingthe party, the apprentice will cast command, then magic missile againstthe most threatening enemy, anduse hold personon another. He will cast cure light wounds upon himself when badly wounded, and attack with daggerifin extremisand unableto escape combat.

The Shaman will cast mirror imageand then playhis magical whistle until onlyone duplicate image remains.

1. **Dining Hall This roomis 55' x 20' witha 10' high ceiling. This placehastwo rowsof three trestle tables. Eachis flankedby benches, with smaller benchesat headand foot, running eastto westinthe westerntwo-thirdsofthe hall. Each table seatsupto 12 small diners. Atthe easternendaretwo tablesina T-shape, the upper stroke nearthe east wall. These tables have small chairsof gnome construction. Thisis wherethe leaders, their special guards, andthe officersnow dine. The head table accommodates eight, the loweroneupto 12. At this time noneofthe dinersare seatedatthe head tables, the officer sitting withtwo serjeantsata table separate fromthe corporalsand regular goblins. The table service consistsof plates, bowls, and cups madebythe gnomes. The food being eatenis typical goblin fare-slumgullian stew. Thereare hunksof half-roasted boaron platters, from whichthe dinerscut slices with their belt knives, boiled turnips, and nutsand hard cider thatthe gnomes storedupand piledonthe tables.

The hallis illuminatedby torches burningin wall sconces, this ambience enjoyedby boththe gnomeswho constructedthe placeandthe goblinswho wrestedit from them. The dinersare enjoying their repast, those finished gorging themselves idly talkingor playing dice.

Wheneverthe party entersthe burrows, there willbea certain numberof goblins here. Forthe sakeof drama (andif usingthe "rebel faction" plot), the Castle Keepermay wishto make this gronpthe adherentsofthe clan'ssub-chief. That beingthe case, these diners willnot assistthe other goblinsin their resistancetothe intruders. They will indeed callonttothe adventurers that they will assist themifthe humans (and such demi-humans thatareinthe party) will sweartonot harm them, and allow themand their familiestogo free whenthe chiefandhis followersare disposedof. Ifthe rivalryand treacheryofthe goblinsub-chiefandhis factionisnot employed, the Castle Keeper must assume thatthe humanoids eatinginthe hallare loyal subjectsofthe clanand will instantly attackany intruders.

Tactics: Assuming thatthe goblins aboveare treatedas faithfultothe chief, when theyare attacked they will fight vicionslyto destroythe party. If they heara commotioninthe passage ontsidethe dining hall they will openthe doorsand moveontin formationto attack. They will formupin ranksof four, regulars first with spearsto hurl, crossbow-armed regularsintwo ranks behind them, the corporalsinthe fifth rank readyto moveupto melee whenthe soldiers before them fall. Beforethe serjeants joinsthe formation, though, the officer will sendone runningtogetthesub-chief unlessthe party enters from that place. The officerandthe remaining serjeant will stay back, readyto moveto where theyare most neededto sustainthe attackonthe enemy.

The same tactics will generallybe followedifthe goblins hereare rebels followingthesub-chiefand fighting againstthe others. Onlytwoofthe goblin servantsare active, the other eightare seatedata corner table nearthe doortothe kitchen corridor,

eating their meal. These goblins will flee attackers, headingforthe nearest door that will allow themto escape.

#### Brothersof Giant Regard **Location: Norvale

**Encounter Chart: Open Grasslands

**Zagyg Adventure Reference:** Buckswood Hills, Yggsburgh, Bigfish Lake, Deerwood, Menhir Hills, Garham, Lord Mayorof Yggsburgh

The Lord Mayorof Yggsburghis even more covetonsof Norvale thanheisofthe Lonely Valley. A road leading thronghit would enable enfeoffmentof fouror more knights with estates there. This would serveasthe basefor further expansionof town lands, and also bring Garham under Yggsburgh's rule. However, the free forestersand wild elves that dwellinthe woodlandsof Norvaleare determinedto preventthe expansionof Yggsburgh's dominions here, knowing that knightsand settlers will devastatethe natural ecology, destroyingitand theirwayof life. Thus, they driveont surveyorsand turn back wandering families seekingto settleinthe valley.

**Adventure Hooks**

1. A partyof four hunters from Garham meetthe characters. They warn them that they have seentwo forest giants lurkinginthe Lakepens Hills, hidingatthe fringeofthe Lake Woods, where they have managedto corrala dozen aurochs. Themen fromthe hamletare sure that these giants would rather dineon humans than wild cattle, sothe adventurons strangersare warnedto stay well away from wherethe hulking brutes have concealed themselves.

Therearetwo olive-green-skinned giants ranging aboutthe Lakepens Hills seeking something bettertoeat. Their namesare Bolgrudand Rutlarg, and this "conple" enjoys feasting upon human, elf, dwarfand gnome.

1. The Lord Mayorhas heardofthe exploitsofthe characters. He summonsthe characterstoan andienceand charges themtogoto Norvaleand encampatits southernend, thereto establisha baseforan engineer, surveyor, and forceof soldiers. Theyare supposed to guardtwomen chartinga ronte thronghthe Buckswood Hillsandthe Deerwood, foranew artery leading eastand north fromthe Menhir Hills Road into Norvale.

Ifthe characters refuse this demand, they willbe considered enemiesbythe Lord Mayor, andhe willlet thatbe knowntoallhis officialsand henchmen. Ifthe party acceptsthe charge, they willbe faced with hostile woodsmenand elvesif they encampinthe valley. These woodsmenareledbya druidwho demands thatthe charactersnot assistthe town forcesin their scheme, warning that warfare will resultif theydo.

Of course, this placesthe charactersina worse quandary than they facedin acceptingor decliningthe missioninthe first place. The likely tactto taketogetontof this dilemmaisforthe charactersto convincethe free folkto demandthe areabe made their fiefin return swearing fealtytothe Lord Mayor, promising paymentsto Yggsburghin natural produce fromthe area (pelts, hides, nuts, and timber) along with military serviceif Yggsburghorits domainsare threatened. Of course, anall-ontwar will bringthe enemiesofthe town intothe field, seekingto attack when thereisa civil conflict raging! The Castle Keeper must decidehowto manageallthe nuancesof this scenario.

Therearetwo listsof forces below. The first contains those forces enconnteredinthe first phaseofthe adventure. They includethe humanand elven woodsfolkthe characters willbe interacting with, as wellasthe troopsand engineers from Yggsburgh. The list following contains those troopsand leaders that willbe called upon shouldwaror confrontation result, andthe Lord Mayorof Yggsburgh decidesto invadethe valley.

should open warfare result from this adventure, the Castle Keeper will havetodo some preparationto allowforthe ensuing battlesand Encounters.

Thereare onlytwo thorpsinthe Broadview Valley, and theyare locatedinan exposed position alongthe River Nemo. The thorpssit uponthe River High Road, which offers easy travel through this area. This fertileand partially unsettledand unclaimed valley posesa thorny (andnota little tempting) problemforthe Yggsburgh's rulers.

Onlythe western halfofthe Broadview Valley acknowledgesthe authorityof Yggsburgh. should settlers from Yggsburghbe encouragedto move intothe placeby granting them land freeholds? shouldthe free town assistin buildinga communityasfar eastas possible? The latter would allowthe knightingoftwoor three eligible wealthy gentlemenwho, with manors populatedby prisoners released from confinementand made villains, could build castlesand help defendthe valleyandthe town.

However, sucha move would surely aronsetheireofthe free minersofthe Glittering Knobs, allthe independent folkin, andfor miles around, the Broadview Valley including Garhamandits allies. As withthe Lonely Valleyand Norvale, eastward encroachmentonthe free borderlands brings angry reaction fromall. Civil strife invites invasion, something being easily accomplishedin this area...

The party will needto alertthetwo knightsof South Pastures, and convince themto callupall available troops, freemen included, to facethe hordeof barbarians. Ifthe adventurers succeedin this, they will needto havea good plansoasto ensurethe raidersare beatenand driven back west, ifnot virtually eliminated. Possible tactics include ambush, theuseofwar engines, and recruiting miners fromthe Glittering Knobs (as their diggings willbea targetfor barbarian attacks oncethe South Pasturesare cleared). The likelihoodof getting demi-human assistance requires that boththe dwarfand gnome leaders agree, forone gronp willnot leave their mines unguarded fromthe other.

In preparingfor this adventure, shoulditbe chosen, useofthe Ordersof Battleis necessaryto developthe demi-human contingent, ifany. The Villagesofthe South Pastures details those troops availabletothetwo lords rulingthe South Pastures. A suggested hordeof barbariansis supplied below.

**Background**

The Archdruid named Dycott Groverwas borntoa familyofthe faithful, his fatherand mother both beingofthe calling. Hewasa precocions child, only 12 whenhe entered intothe First Circle. Thereafter, he advanced rapidly, spending scarcely more thana yearin attaining initiation into eachofthe higher circlesofthe Druidical faith. Whenhewasan ordained Druidatage 27, hewasthe yonngestto have ever achievedso higha rank.

This made Dycott Grover proud, somewhat overlyso, and that pride madehim haughty. The Hierophants detected these flawsand actedto eliminate themby slowinghis advancement thereafter. Hewas sentto work amongstthe Elven folkin remote areasandwas pasttheageof 40 beforehis elevationtothe rankof Archdruid. although bitter aboutthe delay, thenew Archdruid Dycott threw himself intohisnew duties with singular dedication, greatly excelledinhis tasksandwas clearly more effective thanall like personsofthe rank. Itwasat this time thathis Elven wife, a Druidessofthe Seventh Circle herself, lefthim. Divorcewas grantedtoher becauseofhis neglect. Therecanbeno donbt that this affected Dycott Grover more thanthe Hierophant's purposeful suppressionofhis advancement. Bitterness turnedto inner rageanda monomaniacal determinationto risetothe highest rankofthe faith.

Despite somewho cantioned againsthis further advancement, Dycottwas made Archdruidofthe lands that includethe Townof Yggsburgh whenhewasage 45 becauseofhis absolute dedicationand vast ability. To provehis detractors wrong, thenew Archdruid determinedto builda great placeof worship using massive stone monoliths, aswas donein ancient times. Then, he reasoned, thousands would flocktothe monumentfor worship, makinghim firsta Great thenthe Grand Druidand perforcea Hierophant becauseofhis following. Then there wouldbe nonewho could preventhis risetothe firstofthe Cabal. No longer wouldhe, Dycott Grover, be held downby jealons rivals!

Of course, the constructionofthe sacred circleof stoneswasa slow process. It tooka full yearforthe first menhirtobe quarried, shaped, bronghttothe dellhehad chosenasthe siteforthe monumental complex, andset upright. At that rate, Dycott calculatedhe wouldbetoooldto enjoyhis triumph. Many questions botheredhim. Why hadn'thea lifespan comparableto thatofanelf? Whywas thereno natural spell that would speed construction? Extendhis years? Inhis growing frustration, the Archdruid began seeking meansfor fulfillinghis desiresin writingsnotof Druidical nature. Inhis quest, he turnedto forbidden worksof blackest sort. Itwas withina grimoireof this kind thathe discovereda summoning ritual promisingan entity that wouldbeof servicein building vast edifices. The most ancient entity called uponin these summonings wouldbeone that could commandthe greatestof elementals.

Dycott Grover, inhis hubris, thonghthe could deal with such evil without risk, andso after much preparationhe performedthe dreadful ritual that summoned this malign deity. Tohis surprise, the being that appearedtohimwasno terrible monstrosity fromthe Nether Planes. The summoned entitywasa fatherly figureof powerand vitality. Rather than threateningor demanding, the entitywas pleasedat being called forthbyso wisea personasan Archdruid, expressed keen interestinthe reasonfor being summoned, listened attentivelyand gave wordsof connselin return. Cautioning against haste, the being, who identified himselfas Aldforent, noted that Dycott Grover might losehis powersifhe proceeded rashly. Then, beforehe disappeared, he instructedthe Archdruidto consult withhim weeklyby further performanceofthe summoning ritual.

Of course, each further summoning placed Dycott more firmly underthe malign deity's influence. Itwasnot long beforethe Archdruid swore eternal fealtytohim, and thereupontheso- called Aldforent caused earth elementalsto appearand buildthe wholeofthe monumental structureof menhirs, anda secret underground complextoo, ina single night. Therewas amazement amongstthe faithful flock when they beheldthe miracle. Dycott Groverwas thrown intoa rage, however, when mostof those seeingthe place fledin terror. Thenit cametohim thathewasno longera trueand faithful Druid. Whilehe still possesseda semblanceofhis former powers, hehad changed, and this changewas apparentto mostof thoseofhis former faith.

Summoning Aldforent, the once-Archdruid furionsly demandedtobe returnedtohis former state. The evil entity laughed, fornot evenhe could undo what Dycott Groverhad willingly done. Stillin paternal guise, the malign deity played uponallofthe human's weaknesses-lustfor power, desirefor unending life, unquestioning obedience from othersandthe desireto punish thosewho offendedhim. Beguiledinhis despair, the former Archdruid tookthe last stepinhis damnation. Her performedthe ghastly Ritualof Penumbrate Shadow, and became whathe

remainsnow: a horrible travestyofhis former self, a vile lurkerin shadows that consigns otherstothe unspeakable stateheisin.

Asthe penumbrate shadow thatwas once Archdruid Dycott Grover gloats overhis unholy domain, he also rages that therearenot moreofhis kindto servehim. The ancient evil elemental deity couldnot stopthe forcesof nature from confininghisnew protégétothe ringstones whilein shadow form. For Dycott Grovercan moveno more than 14 miles fromthe ringof stones. That beingthe case, the wicked entitywasnot quite satisfied withthe sonlofhis dupe. Forthe deity, whose realmisin that place between Chaosand Order, isas bitterand limitedinhis freedomasisthe former Archdruid, whomhehad hoped wouldbe ableto move about more freely.

althoughthe penumbrate shadow Dycott Groveris awareofthe desiresand disappointmentsof Aldforent, hehas takenall possible measuresto protecthis physical remains, continuehis existenceinthe Planeof Shadowand periodically roamthe material world, albeitin most limited range. Hehas used other forbidden booksto encourage ghonlsto cometothe area duringthe honrsof night, and prey uponany persons living nearthe ringstones. Involuntary penumbrate shadows have been placedto guardthe menhirs, to slay thosewho tonch themand keep intruders fromthe inner partofthe circle. The altarsare protected with deadly devices, and havethe keysand magical aids thatthe Lordsof Nature have placed thereto keepto keepthe cursed hereticin place, sohecanbe discoveredinhis underground lairand then destroyed.

The main objectivesforthe partyare several. First, they must finda meansof defeatingthe guardiansofthe menhirssoastobe ableto enterthe circle. They must then discoverhowtogettothe keysand magic items containedin eachofthe four altars, soastobe ableto enterthe central cairn. Thirdly, they needto openthe four false tombs, defeat their occupants, and gain more magical devices. Next they needto discoverthe

donbly secret meansof enteringthe cryptofthe former Archdruid, and finally they must confrontand besthimin penumbrate shadow form, soastobe ableto destroyhis physical remains.

**The Dellofthe Ringstones**

The exact locationof this placeis leftinthe handsofthe Castle Keeper, butthe Unholy Ringstones (a circleof menhirs) is generally locatedina valley dell abouta bowshot distance northof Hiddendale. The preceding text regardingthe difficultyof locatingthe area, and what lies withinit, appliesand stems from that which createdthe monumental stone complex knownasthe Unholy Ringstones.

The area surronndingthe Unholy Ringstonesis heavily wooded with massivebut strangely twistedoak trees. Inthe hollow surronndingthe ringstones, only sickly weeds spotthe barren, ash-gray dirt. The terrainis hilly, with

Entering fromthe east, the charactersareina corridorof blood- red stone that seemsto have been fusedand smoothed, givingita polished surface. The compositionofthe entire areaisof this nature.

A great burial vaultof black graniteis located nearthefar (east) wall. Itis 12' long, 8' wide, and 6' high. Ithasa 1' thick slab servingasthelid.

A throne-like chairand ornate tableareset beforethe vault. Therearea gold ewer, cup, and plateonthe tabletop worth 1,2500gp, 750gpand 500gp respectively. A small human bone lies besidethe plate.

Alongthe South wallisa deskand plain chair. Uponthe desktopare severalink bottles (inkof black, sepia, blue, green, andred), 10 quill pens, anda stackof what appearstobe 20 vellum sheets. These latterare madeof human skin thatno characterof good alignment will tonch whenso identified. A sand cellar, candle, and sealingwaxare also here.

During those times that Dycott Grover returnstohis body, he castsan animate rock spell uponthelidofthe burial vaultandhasit moved aside. Arising fromthe conch therein, he goestothe tapestry uponthe east walland speaksa command word, after whichthe tapestry becomesa portal. He steps intoitby tonchingthe twistedoak embroidered thereon. Heis then transported intothe tree, stepsont, andis ableto roam about ontside. Sofar into evilhashe sunk that when activein human form, Dycott Grover performs unspeakable acts, including murderand cannibalism. The ghonlsand ghasts hauntthe area becausehe leaves them fine meals. The wicked humanoids regardhimasa quasi-deity, bringinghim captivessoasto keephim from killing them.

shouldthe party findawayto removethelidofthe vault they findthe following:

The unnaturally preserved bodyof Dycott Grover, dressedin Druidical robes, is lying uponan upholstered conch, a scrollinone handanda small crystal ballinthe other. The scrollhasthe druid spell 'transmute rocktomud' writtenonit. The transparent quartz ballis enchanted, so that when squeezeda magical flame like thatofa large candle burns withinit, shedding light accordingly. This effect ends whenthe sphereis squeezeda second time. These were placed hereas safety measuresbythe former Archdruid, to ensure that wheninhis bodyhe could leavethe vault.

The Dunfalcon Pikeisa well-maintainedand patrolled highway stretching from Yggsburghtothe cityof Dunfalcon. It passes thronghthe Baronyof Redfort, Conntyof Kallent, Conntyof Herdleyand thence intothe territoryofthe Free Cityof Dunfalcon. Since aristocrats dependonitfor traveland income, they actually maintainitand sendont occasional patrolstosee that robbersdonot makeittoo hazardonsfor commercial traffic. Thereare sufficient settlements alongthe roadto make travel alongits considerable length possible without great hardship. Thereare five hamletsand numerons thorps between Yggsburghand Dunfalcon. The hamlets have coaching inns, makingthe overall trip comfortable. However, travel alongthe roadisnot withoutits problems. Robbersand highwaymendo bravethe effortof taking loot from unsuspecting merchantsor nobles, despitethe chancesof being canght. Travelers alongthe roadarenot alwaysthe most pleasantof individuals.

Thisisan agreed-upon rusebythe Lord Mayorandhis ministers. A gangof highway robbershas been plaguingthe pike, and they seemto know whentolielowand avoid patrols. However, the Lord Mayor thinks thata teamof tongh characters traveling unbeknownsttothe ontlaws should draw themont.

The Menhir Hills Road winds thronghthe Menhir Hills past Utford Ferry, Hawfair Greenand Stonewyck, the latter beingthe manorof Sir Alecof Gaxhill. Asone might expect, the regionand roadare fraught with danger. Travelcan occasionallybe perilons, so care mustbe taken while moving along this road. The inhabitantsare themselves careful, as thereare often deadly beasts that stalkthe nightandtheday. **Adventure Hook**

At Hawfair's public House, the Leaping Tront Tavern, the proprietor, Stanley "Stont" Shepard, assessesthe characters when they arrive. Heis tryingto decideif theycanbe depended upontoridthe townof some beast. If Stontis impressedbythe party, he mentions thatthe communityhas been paralyzed with fearat night because some sortof creatureis prowling about killing watchdogsand livestock. The folk have takento locking their doorsat sunsetandnot comingont until dawn. Thisisbadfor farmingandforhis business. Unlessthe problemis solved, he explains, there willbeno fairinthe autumn. Ifthe characters agreeto find this creature, Stont offers them free lodgingand foodfora week. Willthe adventurers accepthis hospitality, stayand venture forth after darkto findand destroy whatever monsteris haunting Hawfair Green?

The Castle Keeper needsto decide whatthe prowling creatureis, by determining what wouldbe most interestingor challengingtothe characters. The followingare some possibilities. Noneofthe creatures below will haveany treasureonits person. Ifthe Castle Keeper wishes, a ranger mightbe ableto trackthe monster backtoits lair, and some formof valuablesbe discovered there (and perhaps other dangersas well).

**Werewolf: A gigantic werewolf fromthe Ashwoodis roamingthe countryside eating livestock. Isita memberofthe villageor from some nearby community, andhow long beforeit takesa life?

**Adventure Hook**

Any party insistingon forging aheadon this overgrown pathwayisinfora rude awakening. Random Encounters shouldbe checkedat least oncean hour.

Duringany combat, rollfor another random Encounter. Minimally, three Encounters will occur along this track.

The regionis sparsely settledandthe eastern portionisnot underthe controlof Yggsburgh. Beyond Bowbridgethe River High Road becomes knownasthe March Road, and thenthe King's Highway. **Adventure Hook**

The Lord Mayor desiresa reconnaissanceofthe River High Roadandits extension eastwards. Willthe bold adventurers undertake sucha trek? They must rideforas many daysasit takes themto reachthe borderofthe kingdomtothe northeast, and make notesofall theysee-boththe usualand unusual. If they agree, they willbe furnished horsesas mounts (or spare monntsas applicable), a cook with provisionsona pairof pack mules, and 500gp eachin coinfor expenses incurred.

Besides random Encounters, itis suggested that humanoidsof various sortsbea probleminthe wilderness beyond Bowbridge. The Castle Keeperis encouragedto create details suchas tribal affiliation, territoriesand encampmentsfor these humanoids. Further, the Castle Keeper must create many detailsto feedthe mindsofthe characters with informationfor this portionofthe trek.

about halfway alongthe March Road, the partyis stoppedbya patrolofa scoreorsoof mounted soldiers serving Francois, Dukeof Lorrez. The march theyare riding through belongsto Lorrez. Being considered spiesisthe leastofthe likely ontcomesof this chance Encounter.

Thisisan excellent opportunityfor some clever roleplayonthe partofthe players, and perhaps some derring-doas well.

**Adventure Hook**

When traveling along this trackand passing thronghthe Lake Woods, the party detects faint, tinkling laughterandthe sonndof high-pitched voices. To investigate, they haveto move about 100 yards westward thronghthe trees before they come upona small glen, witha spring-fed pool some 15 feetin diameter. A rivulet runsoffof this pooltothe sontheast witha pleasant plashing sound. Dappled with sunlight, the ground soft with bent grassand thick moss, many flowersand herbs makingtheair here redolent with fragrances, this placeis quite lovely. Thereisnoonein sight, but thereare unusual ripplesonthe surfaceofthe pool.

Ifthe charactersare aggressive, have drawn weaponsor seem threatening, they willbe attackedbythe convocationof "Little People" watching invisibly fromthe surrounding flora. If theyare

restrainedand seem friendlyand accommodating, oneor anotherofthe bolder "Little People" appearsand queriesthe gronpastowhy theyare here.

Ifan attackis made, the partyis peppered withthe "Little People's" arrowsof sleeping until theyall fall asleep. They will awaken backonthe lane, with their clothing insideontand switchedto others, possessions likewise. If this incites themto seek revenge, the next time they nearthe pool, theyare again attacked, this time damagedinthe processof being sentto sleep. They awake with their weapons missing. The "Little People" have removed themand hidden themfar awayinthe woods. Inthe meantime, the "Little People" will have departed this area permanently.

If amicable communicationsare established, the "Little People" frolic aroundthe characters, make rude jests about them, tweakand pinch themina friendly, but most likely irritating, manner. Ifthe party remains good-natured, their "hosts" give eachof thema magical "favor." The followingare examples, but shouldbe expanded uponas necessary.

**Dust **of **Invisibility: When sprinkledona person, thisbagof magical fairy dust makes them invisibleasthe spell. Thereis enonghfor 4 medium-sized persons.

The pool whichthe fairiesare gathered aroundhas accrued some fairy magic. Whena full draughtis taken, it heals 6-24 pointsof damage. Ifthe characters have been friendly, the "Little People" allowthe charactersto takeas muchas they want fromthe pool. One must drinka full flaskofthe waterin orderforitto impartthe healing onceithas been taken more than 50 yards fromthe pool.

Traveling thronghthe hills alongthe East Hillway, the party Encounters three hill giants-a male, female, and half-grown offspring. The male comes rushing forth with ferocity, but holds back from hurlinga bonlder-he simply stopsand shakeshis great club menacinglyatthe party. If theycananddo attemptto parley, they will learn that this familyof giantshas fled Southto escapean ancient black drake that drove them from their home cave. shouldthe partybe willingto attackthe black drake, the male hill giant will certainly assist theminso doing, providing they promiseto allowhis mateandsonto dwellinthe cave afterthe drakeis slain.

The Castle Keepercan play this sceneforallit's worth, but Voolbar willnot risk dyingat this juncture, sointheenda sternly greedy partycan carryoff whatever they wishandare ableto manage.

If Voolbarhas been slain, Shulditand Urjato willbe wailing with grief, beggingthe partyto restorehimto life, and meanwhile crying alondhow little chance they will haveto survive without vast wealthto offerto another giantto protect them.

**Shrineofthe Unknown Paladin**

Thisisnota shrinefor regular worship. The inhabitantsof Stonewyck attend religions servicesinthe castle chapel. However, itisa special sortof shrine. The buildingis only 12 feet wide, 14 feet deep, andhasa peaked timber roof that rises five feet abovethe 12-foot high whitewashed walls. The interioris unfurnished savefora lone vigil lightanda memorialto this venerable martyr. Tothe rightofthe entry thereisa contributionbox hung fromthe wall. Thosewho stop here generally leavea small coinortwo towardsthe upkeepofthe shrine.

Wheredid this shrine come from? Itwas 112 yearsago thata powerful demon lordwas accidentally released froman imprisonmentand began wreaking havoconthe lands around. It

**The Environsof Yggsburgh**

engagedin actsof unspeakable crueltyasit pressed along. At this very site, a lone wandering paladin choseto stand against this vile fiend. Nobody knowswhothe herowas, ashe didn't giveonthis namenordidhe wearor bearany coatof arms. Perhapshewasona secret mission, took somevowof humilityorwasan ontcast. Knowone knows. Whateverthe case, this valiant warriorwas ableto destroythe demon lord's material formbutatthe costofhisown life.

The celestial forces intervenedand destroyedhis body withhis sonl ascendingtoa heavenly peace. This noble sacrificeand subsequent interventionwas notedbythe populaceandthe local clergy erecteda small shrineof whitewashed field stoneto this unknown paladin.

The shrineis maintained oncea weekby Rolandd'Argent, Sir Alec's chaplain. Its exteriorand grounds caredforbythe local residents. Otherwise, itisa placeof quiet reflection. Holymenand pilgrims tendtopay tribute here when traveling thronghthe area. The siteis protectedbythe higher powers. The locationis automatically hedged witha protection from evil effect, andis considered hallowed ground. Anybody attemptingto vandalizeor destroythe vigil light will automatically summona devawho attack instantly those attempting such desecration.

For anyonewho praysor meditates here, the Castle Keepermay award thema unique gift (or generally, a 1ona d20 indicatesa divine gift). If that personis pureof heart, is battlingan overwhelming evil that threatens innocentsandis willingtolay downhis lifeto protect others, a miracle willbe granted thatcan turnthe tideinthe character's favor.

This giftis akintoa wish, butitcan't vanquishthefoe itself. Itcan onlyaidthe character. For instance, ifa noble fighterwas battlinga powerful devil, the miracle wonldn't banishor destroythe creature, butthe fighter might find himself withthe temporary abilitiesofa paladinandhis sword transformed intoa paladin's holy sword. Whereasan actual paladin might gain temporary levels, a spellcaster might havehisorher spells replenished, gainthe assistanceofa summoned celestial being, or havethe abilityto penetratethe fiend's spell resistance. The castle Keeper shoulduse theirown judgmenton this. This boon should only workone timeforthe individual (or entire adventuring gronp).

Otherwise, any characterof good will stopping hereand meditatingforan hour gainsthe benefitofa blessing spellforthe following 24 hours. Clerics gainthe capacityto casta single additional blessing spellon othersinthe 24 hours following.

Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

## Appendix A Developing Yggsburgh

Yggsburghisa large town, of which onlya small portionis developed. This leaves much roomforthe Castle Keeperto fleshontthe city's details accordingto their needsor desires. This section provides muchofthe requisite informationto begin doing that. Copions notesandnota small amonntof work mightbe necessaryto accomplish this, but developingin small portions

should makethe task easier.

### Building Examples

Afew floor plansfor standard typesof buildings fonndinthe townare presentedforusebythe Castle Keeper. Thesecanbe usedas templatesto create specific building plansor serveasa basefor playing withouta formal building planforan exact location, the Castle Keeper altering descriptionsto suitthe locationand purposeofthe structure.

The plans show buildings thatare constructed with walls tonching their neighbors, allthe larger ones having light wells. Only about 20% ofthe town's buildingsare built thus. The majority havea spaceof about four feet between them, with only portionsofthe building tonchingthe neighboringoneinbay-like manner, with side windows looking down uponthe gangway. (See Gangway below.)

#### City Villa

Notethe fencedand gated light wellsof approx. seven-foot depthat frontand back. Thesearefor servantsand tradesmento enter, and they allow light intothe basement. Inthe caseof such mansions being built with walls tonching their neighbor, the gangway entrance willbe accessed fromthe basement-level well, passing under frontand back ground floor extensions that tonchthe next building, the central portionofthe narrow passage opentothesky above, so that upper floorscan have side windows thatletin some lightandair.

**Entrance:** The ground flooris four feet above sidewalk leveland reachedbya broadand shallow flightof stone stairs. Allofthe entrance doors will have barred grates thatare closed, asare window shutters, and lockedat night. There willbe bell-pullsat each door. All windows will have stont shutters thatare closedand latchedat night.

1. Entrancetothe staircasefor serving stafftogotothe first floor.
1. Entrancetothe main staircasetothe basement, useableby staff.
1. Rear lawnand garden area, possiblya stable beyond themonthe alley. There willbea high wall alongthe sidesofthe propertynot walledoffbya neighboring structure, andthe backofthe property will also have sucha wall with spikes atopit, or else buildings that serveto walloffthe alleyinthe same manner. 1. Optional dumbwaiterfor bringing foodup fromthe basement kitchen. If this existsit will ascendtothe first floor, openinginthe master bedroom parlor.

**Basement** The rooms here willbeas follows: large-kitchen, servants' hall (diningand lounge), store room; moderate-buttery, pantry, wine cellar; small-general food storage, furnace room, root cellar, silver vault, two water closets. Also: Moderate- butler'sand honsekeepers bedrooms; very small bedroomsfor other staff (four).

**First Floor** There willbe four bedrooms with parlors, a ladies' sitting room, a children's play room, and three water closetson this floor.

**Second Floor** There willbe four bedrooms with parlors, two bedrooms, and three water closetson this floor.

**Loft On this servants' floor there willbe four moderate bedrooms, six small bedrooms, a large dormitory room, an upper servants' lounge, and three water closets.

This plan will also servefor somewhat larger structures. Room dimensionsarenot given, asthe overall sizeofthe structure mightbe larger, but general proportions will remain constant. For example, ina larger building where there weresix feet added, there mightbe closetsfor onter garments includedon either sideofthe Foyer, asthe Water Closetsare amply largeas shown. In that casethe Lounge wouldbesix feet wider. Beyond thatthe greater width would enhancethe Passageand Hallway breadthtosixand sevenandone-half feet respectively, as wellasthe east- west dimensionofthe Family Dining roomandthe Officeby three feet each, or optionallyall addition accruetothe Great Hall. Of conrsethe Atrium wouldnot lengthenin this case. Ifthe increase were from 90to 120 feet, adding 12 feettothe Atrium's breadth would make sense, asthe sides would eachbe nine feet wider. In such casethe foyer wouldbesix feet wider, have three-foot closetson either side, that adding 12 feettothe breadthofthe Lonngeto matchthe enlarged Atrium. The Dining Roomand Salon would eachbe nine feet wider, the Game roomand Librarysix feet broader, andthe Passageand Hall three feet more broad. Atthe rearofthe mansionsix feet additional width mightbe giventothe Family dining room, sixtothe Office (with three more feetforthe Water Closet there) andallofthe remaining 18 feetbe includedinthe Great Hall dimensions.

Asis usual, thereisan assumption made thatthe wealthy will have such "modern" conveniencesas some limited central heating, indoor plumbing withhotand cold running water, and waste disposalto community sewers. Similarly, someofthe indoor lighting willbe accomplishedby magical means, candles servingad muchfor ambienceasfor illumination.

**Large Building**

This structure might haveanyoneofthe following sortsof uses:

**Town Office Bureau** Floor planas shown, with reception desks immediatelyin frontofthe entrance doorways, railingsto either side, with waiting benchesand gatesto leftand right. Front space occupiedby various clerks. Stairsup leadingtothe most

important bureaucrats' offices above, andontoa second flooror loftin whichold recordsare stored. Underthe staircasesupare like ones leading downto lowest level workers desksand storage vaultsforthe most important records. Inthe central front area willbea small water closetina corner. Desksfor supervisory assistants, and behind themthe officesofthetwo main supervisory clerks. Repeat thisinthe rear portion wherethe Hallways leadtothe backfor intermediate level bureaucratsanda clerks' lounge. Each floor will havea water closet nearthe rearas wellasa frontone.

**Major **Guild **Hall A large reception desk willbe betweenthetwo entry doors about nine feet intothe interior. This front entrance area willbe walledto makethe space 27 feet wideand 19 feet deep. There willbea benchon either sideofthe entry roomandinthefar corners doorsto offices (of 15' x 19' size) that occupy each front corner. One willbefora master memberofthe guild that certifiesthe credentialsof persons seeking permitsor employment situations. The other willbefora master member that issues permitsand noticesfor guild members. There willbe donble doors behindthe reception desk that leadonttoa cross-hallway beyond, this passage also accessedbythe corner offices. The donble staircase willbe whereitis, stepstothe basement beneath them,

In this space willbetwo small corner water closets, anda formal seatingfor members meetingon business, whileatthe back willbea restaurantandbar, the kitchenonthe basement level where thereis also storageand roomsfor guild servants. Onthe first floor willbea front grand assembly hall, flankedby records storage roomsand staircasestothe space abovetothe leftand rightofthe central light well. 12-foot-wide passageways leadingtothe backofthe hall will accessthe guild's large chapelandits shrines, with small side roomsfor vestmentsand altar service. Onthetop floor willbethe officesofthe guild masterandhis assistant, and apartmentsfor master membersin needof lodging space.

**Large Craftsman's Shop** Replacethetwo door entries witha donble gateof 12-foot width between their location, andputina small side door about 12 feettothe sideofthebig entryway. This place mightbe where wheeled vehicles suchas cartsand wagonsor carriagesand coachesare built. It mightbea cooperage making barrels, ora factory producing small watercraft. It might also serveasa wire-drawing factoryora metal foundry. In most cases, the very frontofthe building willbe where finished examplesofthe

**Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh**

The staircases willnotbeas shown, therebeoneoff againsta wallandonthe opposite wall there willbe ramp leadingup. Under both willbe like ways downtothe basement. The remainderofthe interior willbe open exceptfor posts supportingthe floor above. Workmen willbe scattered aboutat wall benchesor laboringon partially completes products restingonthe floor. The basement willbeforraw materials storage. The upper floorfor moreofthe same sortof work thatis goingon below. If thereisa second flooror loft, this willbe reached from streetand back doorsatone sideorthe otherofthe building, not opening intothe main building area, rather accessing long flightsof steps leadingup, unlessthe apartmentsand rooms abovearefor shop workers only. Ifthe upper spaceis rentedont generally, then narrowthe interiorby three feetfor 18 feetin frontandinthe rear. Atthe rearofthe building willbea paved yard, this fencedor walled fromthe alley, with gatesfor entryof materialsand exitof finished work.

Random Encounters Appendix

For purposesof this setting, the communitiesof free folkare classedas "thorps," settlementsof some 100 persons, and "hamlets," communitiesof 200or more persons, but under 1,000 (where "town" becomes proper name). The Castle Keepercan assumeone craftor trade businessfor every 50 inhabitants over 100 personsina community. So, a thorpof 150 persons might well havea blacksmithoranale House, whilea hamletof 250 population would have bothand perhapsa general storeas well. The business fief doesnot includeallof that, butthe workersare employedatthe whimofthe vassalandhe dispenseslow justiceto them, including lifeand death, and might havethe powerof taxation.

Thereare four themesand plots thatcanbe usedif this Encounter occurs. The listcanbe expanded uponand developedas desired.

**1:** The agents attemptto convincethe charactersto assassinatethe town mayorora counsel member. They claimtobeinthe serviceofa Council member, nobleor eventhe Lord Mayor.

**Adventure Hook**

The Castle Keeper must create moreof theseifthe characters remain longattheinnand several passenger gronpsaremet thus.

Of conrsethe whole party shouldgo along, most aboardthe coach, but some ridingis okay. Attheendofthedaythe bandits strike. The melee might involvethe characters being capturedand havingto free themselves, thenget their damselin distress loosetooand deal harshly withthe kidnappersinthe process.

Whileattheinn, the vampire feeds, attacking female guestsin preferenceto males-especiallythe courtesan, heiress, and/or noble lady. although, a lone female coachor riverboat passengers, or evena serving maidofthe staffare fair preytohim. The Castle Keeper should makea pointof havingthe characters notea victim before being slainif thatis practical.

**Rich, Exotic Aristocrat & Entourage** Herethe Castle Keeperis lefttohisown creative devices. This partyof 7-12 individualsis likely from some distant place akintoonrown Persia, Chinaor Japan, or possiblyan American Indian-like gronp suchas Aztecsor Incas. The compositionof sucha gronp will certainly have potent charactersof fighter, cleric, and wizard classes. Togetsofar distant from their homeland they mustbe very ableand tongh.

**Adventure Hook**

Wherethe gronpis fromandwhy theyareinthe areaarethe keysto determining what sortof adventure possibilities, they might provideforthe characters. Perhapsthe exotic travelersare seekinga sacrificial victimof unusual sort, or their being here mightbe more prosaic, sightseeingand gathering knowledge. Whatever suitsthe natureofthe gronpasthe Castle Keeperas devisedit will provide suggestionsfor involvingthe party with them.

**Rich Foreign Aristocrat & Entourage (actually Bandit Highwaymen)** The "Lord" and leaderof this band _(neutral _4th-7th _level _fighter, _HP _8 _per _level, _AC _19, _Significant Attributes _str _17, _SK thespian)_, his chamberlain _(neutral 3rd-6th level wizard, HP 4 per_ _level, _AC _13, _Significant Attributes _dex)_, his herald _(neutral _3rd-6th _level _thief, _HP_ _4perlevel, _AC _13, _Significant Attributes _dex _18) and 2-5 servants _(2nd-4th _level _fighter,_ _HP 6per level, AC 17)_are staying here.

**Adventure Hook**

More opportunityfor roleplay hereandthe options abound! This partyis seekinga rich prize, so manyoftheinn's guestsareof interestto them, includingthe agent partiesas wellasthe exotic aristocratsandthe other foreign ones (vampires). The Castle Keepercan assume this gronpis ontgoingand sociablesoasto learnas muchas possible. They gladly interact withthe partyand consider themas potential marksif theyare flashing wealthand seem relatively vulnerable. Onthe other hand, ifthe characters seem very able, the highwaymen either give thema wide berthor attemptto enlist themina grand robbery scheme, planningto donble-cross them, of course, soasto keepthe swagfor themselves. Alternately, this bandof thieves mightbe clandestine supportersofthe local government becauseitislaxin protectingthe roads, or they mightbe like partisansofoneofthe nobleswho schemeto conquer Yggsburghand makeita provinceof theirown domain.

Thatiswhythe clericis always nearbysoastobe readytouse magicto keephis lord from fainting. Their storyis that theyare stayingat Outs Innto rest before goingonthe Dunfalconto seeka cure there. Thetwo vampires willnot takeany victims fromtheinnand leaveas bats lateat nightto sconrthe area aroundfor such feeding. This local vampiric killings quickly becomethe talkoftheinnand, ifa vampireis present there, the "chaplain" will, athis master's behest, pointa characterontfor beinga vampire. That willnot stopthe killings, andthe party willbe suspectand needto findontwhoisthe culpritor else!

**Riverboat Travelers As with coach passengers, thisisa gronpof assorted travelersof unremarkable sort suchas businessmen, merchantsand well-to-do craftsmen. The leaersare stayingina single room, the others require threeto five single roomsand about halfthe remainderofthe gronp lodgedin dormitory accommodations.

**Adventure Hook**

The Castle Keeper must create moreof theseifthe party remains longattheinnand several passenger gronpsaremet thus. An adventurons passenger, likelya youngman, whohasa treasuremapinhis possession willaskthe partyto accompanyhimona side excursion, soasto findand loota long-lost treasure trove. The location shouldbe nearthe Nemoor Urt Riversanis best managedasa portal takingthe partyfar distance, or elsea cave leadingtoa subterranean place, or bothin combination.

**Ship Owner Captain Captain Ivar Hannes _(lawful _neutral,_ _7th _level _fighter _HP _49, _Significant Attributes _, _str _16 _and _dex _16,SK _business, _nautical)_is stayingina single room here.

**Adventure Hook**

This marineris returning froma river cruiseupthe River Nemo, a sortof busman's holiday. Nowonhisway back downstreamto Dunfalcon City withhis shipthe Silver Wind, the captainis enjoyinga lastbitof recreation before getting backtohis tradingonthe vast inland thathe plies. Soheis drinkingand gamblinganda perfect markforthe card sharps that frequenttheinn. Ifthe party takeshis sideina dispute over cheating, Captain Hannes offers them berthsas marinesonhis ship, forthe watershe sailsare plagued with pirates. shouldthe team accept, they willbeoff downriveranda week laterontonthe open watersofthesea-like bodyof fresh wateron whose shores Dunfalcon City stands. Ona trading cruise that lasts from 4-6 weeksthe characters certainly Encounterat leastonesea monsteranda gangof pirates also. If successfulin overcoming those adversaries, they come backto land with some mariner's skillsand 500gp each plusany loot captured fromthe corsairs theymetand bested. The Castle Keeper might wishto supply this character witha magic item appropriatetohis profession.

The Castle Keeper must devisea reasonfor themto returntothe Outs Innifthe partydidnot leave monntsand excess baggage there. One suggestionis that Innkeeper Gundersonhas lefta messagefor thematthe warehouse where Captain Hannes leaveshis cargo. This noteisa pleafor themto returntotheinnin orderto helpin solvinga mysteryora murderorto prevent further murders.

**Successful Traders Company Three traders _(2nd level_ _fighter, HP 10, AC 13, SS business, Equipment leather armor, short sword_ _and _dagger) and 2-5 servants _(HD _1d6, _HP _4) are stayingin three single rooms withthe servantsinthe dormitory.

**Adventure Hook**

Thesemen noteand seekto hirethe adventurer teamto serveas special guardsfor their planned excursion intothe northeastern Menhir hills. They intendto followthe Quarry Track pastthe place where stoneis taken, for they have intelligence that further along thereisa thriving villageof huntersand trappers witha great storeof peltsand hides just waitingthe traderwho comes with goodsto swapfor them.

Of course there willbe plentyof Encounters alongtheway, andthe villagein whichthe fursaretobe gainsis peopled with rather savage folk. A successful expedition, though should gain each character with 500gpin coinaspay fromthe traders when they returntothe Out's Inn.

**Touring Noble & Entourage This noble _(lawful _neutral,_ _5th-7th level fighter, HP 7per level, AC 18)_, his guard _(lawful good_ _5th _level _fighter, _HP _35, _AC _18)_, his ladyand madam, four servants, twomenandtwo maids _(all _HD _1d4) are staying here. The nobleandhis ladyare stayingina suite, the guardand four servantsareinone room whilethe remainderareinthe dormitory.

**Adventure Hook**

Perhaps this apparently rather foppish gronp cametotheinnvia theirown coach, thetwo noblemen riding their steeds, in which case there willbea coachman stayingtoo. While seemingly just enjoyingan onting, the noble might wellbe spyingontthe area, carrying secret communicationsforthe lord mayor. Not wantingto reveal that, the noble would then engagethe partyto delivera special gifttothe masterof Yggsburgh, paying each personinthe gronp 50gpfor their tronble. Ifthe gift containsa secret communication, the cabalof counsel members will attemptto have their bully-boy minions interceptthe characters. Onthe other hand, the gift couldbea deadly sortof magicalor mechanical trap meantto killthe lord mayor. Inthe latter casethe noble gronp willbe departingthe Outs Inn abruptly, withthe knight remaining behindtoget wordof successor failure before spurringonto catchup withthe othersinthe gronp.

**Tronpe **of **Famons **Performers This companyof actorsis composedof twelve actorsand performers _(HD _1d6, _HP _variable,_ _SS thespian)_.

The tronpehas stoppedattheinnto restafew days before appearingin Yggsburghto performforthe lord mayor, counsel, and other important personsofthe town. Thereafter, they performinthe Outs Playhonseforas longas they fillthe House, then travelon downthe Nemotosee aboutan engagementin Dunfalcon. Whileattheinn they perform amusing skits, songs, and minstrel entertainmentsinthe lonngeand thusget free mealsand drinks. As actors, the membersare 50% likelytobe ableto spotinn patrons using deceptionand pretendingtobe something other than what theyare. Ifthe party becomes friendly withthe tronpe, slips coinstooneor more members, the performer(s) mention their observations regarding posing gueststothe adventurers, thus giving them solid clues. Of course, someofthe assumptions madebythe actors willnotbe correct... The Castle Keeper might wishto supplythe leader witha magic item appropriatetothe tradeofthe gronp, likelyit belongingtothe headofthe company.

**Wealthy **Merchant **Gronp four merchants _(lawful _neutral,_ _HD 1d6, HP 5, SK business)_, each witha servant _(3rd level fighter, HP 16, AC 13, daggerand spetum, SK business)_are staying here. The merchantsarein single roomsandthe servantsareinthe dormitory.

**Adventure Hook**

Highway robbery! hat's what this gronp willbe complaining londly about, for they were heldupon theirway hereby bandits (afootor mounted). Ifthe characters inquire, the merchants offera rewardforthe captureofat leastoneofthe robbers (the rest preferably dead) andthe returnofthe personal propertyand lettersof credit stolen from them. The rewardis 2,500gpasthe lettersof creditare worth several millions. Ifyou supplythe bandit gronp with some other lootandany magic items, this scenario couldbea great conpfor surviving party members.

**Well-to-do **Pilgrim **Band This gronpof pilgrims consistofa priest _(neutral _good, _3rd _- _6th _level _cleric, _HP _5 _per _level)_, two assistant priests _(neutral _good, _1st _- _2nd _level _cleric, _HP _5 _per _level)_anda provost _(neutral good, 4th - 7th level rauger, HP 6per level)_and 5-12 pilgrims _(HD _1d4, _human _sereauts)_.

**Adventure Hook**

The chief clericofthe pilgrims urgesthe charactersto joinhis gronponits pilgrimagetoa holy siteinthe monntainsfartothe west.

The following informationis suppliedfor those Castle Keepers that desireabitof "difference" in otherwise familiar things suchas livestock seen-riding horses, dogs, farm animals. A casual mentionof something different fromthe normal seeninonr world addstothe fantasy natureofthe setting while increasing verisimilitudefor those concerned withthe mundane.

**Dogs** Most dogs encountered willbe mixed breedof moderate size. The following examplesare givenfora description basefor other sorts keptfor various reasons: Belgian Shepard (draft, guard, herding), Border Collie (herding), Greater Swiss Mountain Dog (draft, herding), Irish Wolfhound (guardingand hunting), Mastiff (guarding, hunting, andwar), Norwegian Elkhound (guardingand hunting), and whatever sortsof hunting dogsyou careto include-honnds, pointers, setters, spaniels, terriers.

**Horses** The GMcan referto known breedsin describing horses, especiallywar horses. The destrieris akintoa Shire horse, the chargeris similartoa Percheron, anda conrsercanbe likenedtoa Morganora Saddlebred horse. Coloration described shouldbethe normal rangeof white, gray, dapple gray, bay, sorrel, chestnut, and black. Setting specific breeds:

Uplands: Coursers, racing horses, riding horses, coach horses; coloration tends towards blue roanor strawberry roan.

Valebred: Chargers, riding horses, coach horses, draft horses; coloration tends towards dark grayor black.

Westfields: Destriers, draft horses, work horses; coloration tends towardsbay, withthe best animals usually cremeloor buckskin.

**Cattle For general flavorin description, the Castle Keepercanuse standard breedsof earth-Aberdeen Angus, Galloway, Hereford, Red Polled, Shorthornfor beef; Ayrshire, Dutch Belted, Guernsey, Holstein-Frisian, Jersey, Kerryfor milk; Brown Swiss, Charolais, and Retintafortri-purpose (draft, meat, milk) cattle.

**Meadland** A large dual-purpose animalfor meatand milk, with long, lyre-shaped horns, anda vertically striped coatoftanto buff with thin bandsof brownorred.

**Sheep **& **Goats Usethe modelsofthe Rambonillet sheepandthe black & white Bagotand Valais Blackneck goat.

**Sonthdowns A largeand hardy breedoftri-purpose (wool, meat, milk) sheep. A full-grownram will weigh between 250and 300 pounds, aewe abouttwo-thirds that. Despite selective breeding, about halfofa typical flock will have black, dark brown, of sorrelred wool. Rams have large, curling horns, eyes small ones.

**Menhir **Hills A very large breedof hairy dual-purpose (meatand milk) goats witha full-grown billyinthe 150 pound range. The front halfofthe animalisred-blackor black, the hind part whiteor ivory. Malesand females have long horns forminga Y-shape above their head, billies having longerand thicker ones. **Swine Chosethe modelor modelsyou prefer-Berkshire (medium sized black with white muzzleand socks, meat producer), Durok (large sized light goldento mahoganyred meat producer), Gloncestershire (large sized white with black spots lardand meat producer), or Tamworth (smaller sized goldenredto deepred, bacon producer).

**Hillwood** A large dual-purpose animalfor lardand meat-less lardif allowed rangeinthe open. These swineare long-leggedand high-bodied, their coat dark brown withtwo horizontal bandsof sandy coloron their flanks. An adult boarcan weighas muchas 800 pounds, butthe averageis around 650.

**Swans, **Geese, **& **Ducks Swansare either blackor white; no more needsbe said. The white Embden gooseandthebig gray Tonlonse (white hindquarters, blackish backand wings) are sufficientfor covering geese. One must have both white (Pekin) and colorful (Ronen, a large, Mallard-like species with more readinthe drake's breast) ducks.

**Turkeys, Peafowl, Chickens, & Guinea Fowl** As thereis commerce betweenalthe continents, itisnot unreasonableto include turkeysinthe rosterof farm ponltry. Those raised will look likeonr domesticated wild turkeys, withno white variety seen. The same appliesto peafowl.

As chickens willbe seenin many places, the following breedsare suggestedfir varying descriptions: Andalusian (speckled blackand gray), Hondan (white), Brown Leghorn (rooster: whiteear, red neckand back, lower body green fadingto blackat legs, upper wingred, middle green, end buff, tail green; hen: whiteear, brownand black speckled neck, throatand breast rosy brown fadingto rosy buffat legs, brown lower body below brown-black wingsand tail), Minorca (black) Buff Orpington (buff), and Rhode Island Red (bright rustred with tailend feathers green).

Guinea fowl looka good deal like small, combless chickens with coloration ranging froma near white through light grayto medium brown gray, no distinction between maleand femaleis apparent. The cockis aggressiveand will fightoffa hawk, givingoffa warningcry whenso threatenedor whenany feral animalor strangeris detected. The meatofoneof these fowlsis gamyin flavorand much appreciatedby thosewho enjoy wild game.

**Doves & Pigeons** Both dovesand pigeons willbe keptfor food. Homing pigeons will alsobe raisedfor carrying messages. The Game Master should haveno problem describing these well- knownand common birds.

**Rabbits** Angora, Belgian Hare, and Flemish Giant rabbit breeds will serveas modelsfor domesticated rabbits. Appendix F, Magic Itemsand Spells

Shaman mummiesare fonndin enclosed burial chamberand have usually been sanctifiedby ritual magics upon internment. Theyarean undead creature wrappedin divine bandagesand urgedto existence through prayerand ceremony. Mummiesare bonndto their tombsandare enconnteredin their vicinity. Any creature that defilesor lootsthe tombofa mummyis doomedto facethe mummy's wrath. Their connection withthe artifactsof lifeandthe resting placesofthe deadare tremendons, and they punish grave looters with unmediated violence.

The process requiredto createa mummy givesthe creature powerful protections against physical damage. However, the most terrifying aspectofa mummyisnotits abilityto withstand damageor doggedly pursueits quarry, butits lingering effects upon those that managedto escape. The tonchofa mummy instillsa disease that cansesa victim's bodyto slowly wiltingand rotting away intoa useless massof pulpy flesh. These creaturesare often createdin pairs, butthe most unholy sanctumscanbe guardedbyupto eight.

**Combat:** Mummies enter combat without fear. Theydonot take prisoners, anddonot bargainor communicate. They batter their foes until victorions, orthe mummies themselvesare destroyed. Sleepand charm spells, as wellas poisonand paralysis, haveno affecton mummies. Theycan onlybehitand damagedby magical weapons.

**Despair:** The mere sightofa mummy cansesan opponentto become unnerved, shakenand repulsed. This affectis identicaltothe spell fear. In addition, an additional wisdom saveis requiredbyall opponents. Ifthe save fails, that victimis paralyzedbythe mummy's presence, and remainssofor 1d4 rounds.

This bonusis cumulativetothe bonus givento humans. For example, iftwo mummiesare present, 12 gronp membersare requiredto gaina +1 bonus, giving humansa totalof +3. **Mummy Rot:** A victim strickenby this horrible affliction contractsa dreadful disease that resists natural methodsof healing. Onlythe spell cure diseasecan remove Mummy Rot. Each timea victimis struckbya mummy, a successful constitution saveis requiredto resistthe mummy's scabrons tonch. Failure indicates thatthe creaturehas been afflicted withthe Rot, andno further savesare allowed. While afflicted with Mummy Rot, magical spellsand effects that restorehit pointsdonot functiononthe victim. Methodsof natural healing, including regeneration, are 10 times slower. In addition, a victimof Mummy Rot losestwo pointsof charisma each month, permanently, culminatinginthe victim's death 1d6 months after exposureand contraction.

Otyughs thrivein filthand decay. Theyare fonndin most climates, but always live undergronndin dungeons, city sewers, or reeking cesspools.

**Combat:** An otyugh's attackis very forthright: it will attemptto drag victims intoits offal-filled lairto killand devour them. They alsomay attemptto asphyxiate their victimsby thrusting them into heapsof refuseand holding them there.

Penumbrate shadowsarethe semi-corporeal spiritsof humans, demi-humans, or humanoids that have voluntarilyor involuntarily been drainedof their life energyyet retaina shadowof life. They appearas translucent chiaroscuro imagesof themselvesas they appearedin life. Theyarenot undeadinthe true sensedueto this tenuons link, but since they feedonthe energyof neutral shadowstuff, druidscan affect themas clericsdo undead. Theyarenot easily turned, their resistanceto such being equaltoa 7hit dice monster (or theirownhit dice, whicheveris higher). A successful confrontationof penumbrate shadowsby druids will send them either backtothe Planeof Shadowortoanon-corporeal stateif theyare bound (doomed) toa material location.

The voluntary attainmentofthe stateof beingasa penumbrate shadowcanbe achieved onlybya druidwhohas embraced eviland through enactmentofa dreadful ritual fonndin certain forbidden textsof blackest malevolence. Those voluntarily becominga penumbrate shadowareof utmost strengthand achieve eternal existenceonthe Planeof Shadow, that existence ending onlyif their semi-corporeal formis totally annihilatedonthe Material Plane from whence they came.

Furthermore, voluntary penumbrate shadowsare abletore- animate their physical remains whenever theyso desire, thus gaining normal physical existence again. Re-animationcanbe accomplishedfora numberof days equaltoor less than their total numberofhit dice, and eachdayof physical existence thus essentially canse damage equaltoonehitdie. When this damageto their shadow strength equals zero (0) remaininghit points, penunbrate shadowsare forced back intothe nether worldsto recuperate lost strengthatthe rateofonehit pointperday.

The numberofhit dice possessedby penumbrate shadowsisthe sameasthe total they possessed when living, butthe potential maximumhit pointsperdieisa constant 10 becauseof their altered state, no constitution bonus accruing. Voluntary penumbrate shadows havea minimumof 12hit diceand 60hit points. If involuntary ones attain such power, 12hit diceand 60hit points, theyare freeof their creator, no longer doomedtoa single location, but otherwise unchangedin regards their state. Knowing this, voluntary penumbrate shadowsare generally carefulto createnew (involuntary) ones that have fewerhit dice thanthe 12 they possess. Appendix G, Monsters

**Immuneto normal weapons:** becauseof their semi-corporeal state normal weapons affect thembut little, anyhit inflicting onlya single pointof damage. Only Magical weaponsand attackby spells canse full damageto penumbrate shadows.

**Other Immunities:** Penumbrate shadowsare immuneto mind- affecting spells including charming, confusion, and sleep. Fear, paralysis, petrifaction, and poisondonot affect them; while cold, electricity, and fire inflict only 1hit pointof damageperdieof potential damage.

**Vulnerabilities**: Penumbrate shadowsare subjectto damage from bright lightand direct sunlight. Beingin direct sunlightora _light_or _contiuual light_ spell cast directly uponone inflicts 1 pointof damageper round. A _suuray spell affects theminthe same mannerasit does undead.

**Combat:** The penumbrate shadow willuseits semi-incorporeal formto move through shadowed walls, obstacles, and other solid objectsto deter attack while striking from unexpected directions withits Strength draining ability.

**Create Spawn:** Living victimscanbe dupedor forced into becoming penumbrate shadowsbya druid turnedto evil enactingthe forbidden rite upon them when theyare captivesor pawns. Eveninthe latter case, the resultisa penumbrate shadow thatis enslavedtothe voluntary memberof this ineffable stateof existence that created them. Evenifthe "master" (i. e. voluntary) shadowisnot present, they must obeyany other voluntary shadows thatarein proximityand command them; so longas such commandsarenotin conflict with prior orders from their creator.

The creator penumbrate shadowcan consign themtoone place which theycannot leaveor have them followhimas servants. Whenever this "master" is within 100 feetofoneofhis created lesser penumbrate shadows, whateverhe commands mustbe obeyed. In sucha case, whenever more thanone penumbrate shadowis encountered, one willbea "master" shadowandany others their unwilling vassals. Itis quite rareto Encounter more thanone master type shadow together, as they jealonsly guard theirown powerand slaves againstall interlopers.

**Strength Drain:** The tonchof penumbrate shadowsor their weapons draws fromthe target subjects' strength energy, that energy being consumedbythe attacking shadessoastoaddto their totalhit points, asit makes them stronger thus. When penumbrate shadows attain their maximumhit dice total, they become more powerfuland gain anotherhitdie.

Theyare nearly always fonndin deep subterranean places. Bizarrein appearance, xorn resemblea stony cylinder with three legs, topped witha gaping, voracions month. Spaced evenly arounda xorn's bodyare three arms; a singleeye occupiesthe space between eacharm. Their skinis hardand rock-like. Xorn feed upon gems, rare minerals, and precions metals, and questfor them constantly. Upto 4of these creaturescanbe encountered.

Xornare rareonthe mortal realms, for theycannot travelthe planes themselves. Theyare occasionally summonedtothe primeby powerful wizards that desiretousethe xornfor excavating. Xornare abletodig through earthand stone rapidly, and when pressedcan move even quicker through stone, without leavinga traceof passage. Being highly intelligent, oneof these creatures will certainly escapeby merging intothe nearest earthor stoneand burrow away whenitshit pointsareator below 50%.

**Combat:** Xorncan blend with stone, bothin appearanceand molecularly, and this enables themto take opponents unawares. Theyuse their illusionsand suggestionsto surpriseor otherwise catchan potential opponentsoff guard, particularlyif those individuals carryany sortofgem, precions metal, or rare mineral, which xorncan smellata rangeof 20 feet. They will demandtobe given these materialsto devour, andif this demandisnot honored, a xornis likelyto attemptto take these materialsby force. In combat, xornuse their clawsand powerful biteto attack. Ifthe fight goes poorly, a xornmay meld into stoneby alteringits molecular structure, and escape.

A move earth spell castonan area containinga burrowing xorn flingsit back 30 feet, stunningitfor 1 round unlessthe creature succeedsata physical save. If phase dooris castona xorn thatis gliding through rock, itis slain instantly.

**Essenceof Stone:** As creaturesof elemental earth, xorn share qualities withthe stone they live withinand tunnel through. These qualities give them advantages, likea tongh onter shell (armor class) andthe abilityto move through rock rapidly. However, any spell thatcan affect stonecan havean effecton xorn. Spells suchas move earth, transmute rocktomud, or stoneto flesh will softena xorn, cansingit great painand givingitan effective armor classof 15forone round. Xorn cannotuse their earth glide ability while suffering from these effects.

**Illusions/Suggestions: All aberrant elder xornare ableto generate illusion magicby concentration duringa round. This includes "invisibility" to creatures around them. Theyare also capableof making suggestionsofuptosix wordsin length.

**MOVE: **60** **ft.**

**AC: 15**

**ATTACKS: **Weapon **(+5)**

**SPECIAL: **Energy **Drain, **Create **Spawn, **Dark **Vision **60 **ft.** **Significant AttributesVES: M**

**INT: **High**

**ALIGNMENT: **Chaotic **Evil** **TYPE: Undead (Unique) TREASURE: 5**

**XP: 200+5**

The wretch wight appears similartothe more common wight (_please referto Monsters & Treasure_), but these creatures' utterly black eyes seemto havered flamesin placeof irises. They residein burial cryptsand tombs, emerging onlyto pursueand consumethe life forceof their living prey.

**Combat**: Like their lesser consins, the wretch wight engagesan opponentto maim, hurt, and cripple. They delightin takingthe life energyand possessionsof their hapless victims, andin returning themtothe same unlifeasthe wretch wight "enjoys". They despiseall living thingsand will attack withno provocation. They tear into their opponents with clawed fingers, rending fleshand boneas wellas drainingthe very life from their victims.

**Energy Drain**: The fonl tonchof wretch wights cansesthe lossofthe victims' energy, this reflectedbythe lossofone experience levelper tonch. The draining imbuesthe wretch wight with power, increasinghit pointsby 1perhitdie, and whenthe maximum numberofhit points (12) is reached they gainan additional overallhitdie-withthenewhit points total being averaged. For example, a wretch wight going from 60 Hit Pointsand 5hit diceto 6hit dice, the totalhit points would remainthe same overall, withthehit point averageperdie reducingto 10.

**Create **Spawn**: Any victim totally drainedof energy thus becomesa wretch wight withthehit dice average indicated above, thenew creature underthe controlofthe wretch wight that slewit. The slaying wretch wight must wanttouse this ability; itisnot automatic. A creature affected losesall abilities, and gainsthe statisticsofa wretch wight. Spawn createdin thiswayare only half strength; they have 3hit dice, insteadof 5, and losethe abilityto create spawn, butare otherwise identical.

# Appendix H

## Optional Rules

The following section contains optional rules whichthe Castle Keeper should consider usingin keeping withthe original intentofthe setting's designerandthe mannerin whichthe current Castle Zagyg campaignis being played. All these optionscanbe ignored, exceptforthe dual classing rules. However, the latter rulecan pertain onlytonon-player charactersin this settingandnot necessarilytothe characters. Reviewthe rules carefullyand makea decisionasto whetherornot theyare applicableto your game's needs.

### Socio-Economic Class Standingfor Characters

When beginning playin Yggsburgh, the Castle Keepermay wantto allowthe charactersto randomly generate their character's socio-economic standingand, thereby, their starting wealthand possessions. The followingis offeredasa guideline.

To determinea character's socio-economic background, rolla d10andthe number generated equalsthe socio-economic class rankor standingofthe character's family unless otherwise stated. A rollof 1 indicatesthe upper-upper tier, a 9the lower-lower tier, anda 0the underclass-a former vagabons, serf, or criminal (see chart below). This representsthe character's background thoughnot necessarily their current status. For that, seethe Character Class Social Standing chart below.

#### Background Class

D10	Social Class 1. middle lower class
1. upper lower class 1. upper middle class
1. lower upper class **Classand Level	Social Class**

**Cleric, Bard, **Fighter, **Monk, **Ranger, **Druid** 7th - 12th	lower-upper class

13th - 18th	middle-upper class

**Appendix H, Optional rules**

**Knight, Paladin** 10th - 18th	middle-upper class

19th +	upper-upper class

**Wizard, Illusionist** 7th - 12th	lower-upper class,

13th - 18th	middle-upper class, **Thief, Assassin, Barbarian** 7th - 9th	middle-lower class (middle criminal underclass)

10th - 12th	upper-lower class (lower-upper

criminal underclass) 19th +	upper-middle class

The character's actual socio-economic standingis adjustedbythe character's classand levelatany given time. Dualor multi-classed characters, usethe averageofall applicable rolls. As characters progressin class levels, their socio-economic standing increasesas indicatedonthe chart above. Characters generally never move downin social standing exceptat Castle Keeper discretionandasa resultof nefarions deedsor actions.

Withina demi-human societyor communities thereisno adjustment. In human societies other than thatofthe Underclassand Criminal Underclass, all demi-humans except elvesare viewedasone socio-economic class lower than their human equivalent. This doesnot affect their initial funds (see below).

**Player Character Initial Funds**

The initial fundsfor characters beginningin Yggsburghis based upon social standingor class rankingandnotthe character class. The following chart shouldbe usedto determine beginning moneyand someofthe equipmentforthe character. **Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh**

1. 80gpand choiceof horse, armor, upto 6 weapons
1. 70gpand choiceof horse, armor, upto 5 weapons
1. 60gpand choiceof horse, armor, upto 4 weapons
1. 50gpand choiceof horse, armor, upto 3 weapons
1. 40gpand riding horse, chain mail, upto 2 weapons
1. 30gpand riding horse, chain mail, upto 2 weapons
1. 20gpand riding horse, studded armor, and 1 weapon
1. 15gpand leather armor, 2non-sword weapons
1. 10gpand padded armor, 1non-sword weapon

0	2gpand leather armor, 4non-sword weapons

Assume that characters witha mount saddleand tack, including saddle bags. Other equipment desiredbythe character mustbe purchased withthe starting money.

**Player Characters Starting Above 1st Level**

In orderto reflect gains acquired from adventuring activity that mustbe assumedto have occurredinthe processof gaininga levelor levels above 1st, the Castle Keeper should adjustthe resonrcesof each characteras follows:

The character gains 50gpper level plus 10% of starting moneyfor each level above 1st level. For instancea 2nd level characterinthe 1st rankof socio-economic class adds 50gpfor 2nd leveland 200gp (10% of starting moneyx 1) to starting funds, whilea 3rd level characterofthe 10th rankof socio-economic class adds 100gpfor 3rd leveland 10gp (10% of starting moneyx 2fortwo levels above 1st) to starting funds.

Multi-classedor dual classed charactersusethe levelofone classasa basefor added starting money; then conntthe levelsofa secondor third classat half value when adding level bonus. For examplea dwarf cleric/fighterof 4th/3rd levelofthe 7th socio- economic class rank wouldadd 125gp (30% ) to starting moneyfor being three levels above 1st, and thenaddforhis combined levels above 1st, 150gpfor cleric level (50gpx 3) and 50gpfor fighter level (50x 2x.5).

**Equipmentfor each Level above 1st**

Assume thatall ordinary equipment other than horses, armor, and swords have been acquiredinthe conrseof adventuring, sothe playeris freeto list whateveris desiredin this regard. If 3rd levelor above, allow characters lacking choiceof horse, armorand weaponto selectoneof eachfor personaluse evenifofthe lowest socio-economic class.

### Armsand Armors

#### Wearand Tear

Weaponsand armorcan takea severe beatingin combat. Armormay eventually simply ceaseto functioninits original capacityand become uselessas strapsare shorn away, clasps become unworkable, rents, dentsand holes makeit less capableof deflecting weaponsor absorbing impacts while more serions dentsand holes makeit simply unwearable. Likewise, weaponsmay breakanddo become duller over time, heads loosen from shaftsandthe effectsof rustcan take their toll. These rules reflect these occurrences. Itis contemplated that armorand shields suffer damagein relative proportionto that sufferedbythe individual possessing them. All armorhashit points that mustbe trackedashit pointsfora characterare. The gradethe armor's manufactureis important when makinga purchaseas that effectsthe amonntofhit points that armorhas. Additionally, salvaging armor from dead opponentsis alsoa concernasittomaybe destroyedor weakened. This added consideration means that Player Characters should haveto have their armorand shields repaired from timeto time, and that salvaged armor, shields, and weapons willnotbe worthwhilein many cases. Of conrseit also enconragesthe charactersto seekontthe best quality (Fine Grade) armor, shields, and weapons.

Armor'shit pointsare determinedby rollinga 1d6 multipliedbyits armor class bonus (1+) and then multipliedbythe qualityofitsof make (1-5). For example, a character purchases chainmail armorof superior quality. The player rollsa d6 (assumea 3), multiplies thisbyits bonus (+5) fora 15. This resultis multipliedbyits quality multiplierandfor superior armorsitis 3 givinga finalhit point totalof 45forthe chainmail.

Eachhit pointof damage receivedbythe characteris also appliedtothe armor. Whenthe armor reaches zerohit points, its effectivenessis reducedandits modifieris reducedbyone point. After thisthe process begins again withthe armor taking twicethe amonntof damageasthe character wearingit receives. Onceitshit pointsare lost, its effectivenessis reducedby 2 points. At this pointthe processis repeated againbutthe armor takes damageat four timethe ratethe characters does. Oncethe armor reachesitshit point maximum, its modifieris reducedby 4 points. After this, the processis repeatedbutthe armor takes damageat eight timesthe ratethe character does. Oncethe armor reachesithit point limit, its effectivenessis reducedby 8 points. The process continues like this withthe reductions donbling each time. Once armor reaches +0forits armor modification, itis considered destroyed.

When determining what degreeof wearand tearany armorhas, simply compareits original armor modification withits current armor modification. Dividethe current modificationbythe original modificationandthe resulting percentageisthe amonntof wearand tearithas suffered.

Repair restoresthe loss, andthe shieldis alwaysin needof repairtooin such cases. Costsfor thisis giveninthe detailsof Yggsburgh Encounter 62. Elite Arms & Armor. Outsidethe town, youcan assume that smithscan repair metal armor, leather workers restore that sortof armor, at costsin timeand money equalto those indicatedforthe weapons shop's.

Armorand shields comein four qualitiesof workmanship labeled 1-5or poorto fine. Further, each quality categoryis associated with certain gronpsof peopleor creatures. 1. Superior armor/shields	Military-type
1. Fine armor/shields	Elite units **Weapons**

Similarto armor, weaponsmay wear down. Like armor, weapons comein four categoriesof quality (see below). Thus beforea combat takes placethe Castle Keeper will needto establishthe gradeof armorand weapons being employed. As with armor, the category establishes purchaseand repair cost (see Yggsburgh Encounter 62. Elite Arms & Armor).

Thereisa chancefor weapon breakageonany attack roll witha natural 1. Dependingonthe qualityofthe weapon being used, breakagecan occur. Seethe chartto determineifthe weapon breaks.

**Weapon Quality	Chancefor Breaking** 1. Superior	Roll d20 again, it breaksifthe resultis 1-5
1. Fine	Roll d20 again, it breaksifthe resultis 1

Magical Weaponsare more difficultto break. Fora magical weapon, two confirming d20 rollsof 1 givea chancefor breaking. A third d20is rolled withthe following results:

**Weapon Type	Breaks** Sturdy Metal	Breaksona 1-2

### Noteson Dual-Classand Multi-Classing

It seems reasonableto this author that very able charactersbe ableto operateintwo distinctandnot incompatible classesatthe same time. Thus, a fair numberofthenon-player characters enconnteredin this setting have dual class statusandit wouldbe unfairnotto presentthe players withthe same options.

Therearetwo options whena player decideshis character should have more thanone class. The first optionis multi-classing. This allowsa charactertobe madeupof more thanone class when initially created. The second optionis dual classing. Dual-classing allowsa characterto acquire another class lateronin their career. Appendix H, Optional rules

#### Multi-classing

**Choosingthe Classes**

1. Any classcan combine withany other class barring alignment restrictions.
1. Upto three classescanbe chosenfor humansandtwofor demi-humans.
1. The classes chosen must correspondtoa prime attribute.

**Advancing Levels**

1. All experience pointsare dividedup equally amongstthe classes chosenforthe character. For example, ifa fighter/ rogue wereto receive 250 experience points, 125is appliedtothe fighter classand 125tothe rogue class. All fractionsare dropped.
1. Oncea character acquires enough experience pointsto progressinone class, theydoso. For example, a cleric/wizardhas 2,252 experience pointsin boththe wizardand cleric class (they must alwaysbe equal), that character advancesto 2nd level cleric while remaininga 1st level wizard.
1. When advancinga level, usethe Hit Dice typeforthe classone advancedinto determinethe numberhit points gained. Usingthe cleric wizard above, the player rollsa d8forhit points. Whenthe character acquires 2,602 experience points, a d4is usedforhit points.
1. The character levelisthe accumulated levelsofallthe classes. Soa 4th/4th level rogue/fighterhas 8 character levels. Atthe pointthe 11th character levelis gained, hit point accumulation changes. At this point, hit point accumulationis equaltothe advancementofthe character' classesat 10th leveland beyond. For example, a 5th/5th fighter/rogue gainsa levelof rogueso gains +2hit points, when that character gainsa levelof fighter, they gain +4hit points.
**Restrictions**

1. Multi-classed characters takethe besttohit bonusof their classes.
1. Multi-classed charactersusethe least restrictive weapons listfor their classes.
1. Multi-classed charactersusethe most restrictive armor listof their classes.
1. Multi-classed characterscannot combine abilities. For example, a fighter's extra attack means thatthe charactercan makean extra normal attackandnotuse that extra attackto deflect missiles, makea back attackor inspire.
1. Starting goldis determinedby rollingfor each class individually, combiningthe resultsand dividing thatbythe numberof classesthe characterhas. Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

### Dual-classing

Dual classingis similarto multi-classing onlyin thatthe characterhas several classes. The classesare acquired differentlyand progressionis slightly different. In dual classing, the player's character begins withone classand decidesto change careers (soto speak) andaddona different class.

#### Acquiring Classes

1.1. The character must start withone class.
1.1. The character must progressat leastone levelinthe starting class before addingan additional classtohis character.
1.1. Barring alignment restrictions, any classcanbe added. Prime attributesdonot restrict class choice. A charactercan havea maximumof three classesbut before adding another class, the character must progressat leastone levelinthe most recently added class.
1.1. Before addingthe classandits abilities, the character must undergo training. Before takingthenew class, he must earn donblethe numberof experience points requiredforthenew classto reach 2nd level. Only after this numberof experience points have been earned doesthe character acquire those class abilities. Furthermore, the character mustbe working with another characterornon-player characterofthe classtobe addedand they mustbeat least 3rd level. And finally, whilein this periodof training, they must obeyallthe restrictionof being dual classed (see below). In this case, all abilitiesand checks associated withthenew classare madeat -5andno magiccanbe used.

For example, a fighter decidesto becomea thief. After attaining 2nd levelasa fighter, the player decidestoaddthe rogue classtothe character. He then must gain 3000 experience pointsin cross-over training before adding 1st level roguetohis character. Additionally, this 3000 experience points mustbe earned whilethe characteris underthe tutelageofa 3rd levelor greater rogue. During this training period, the charactercanuse rogue abilities (suchas pick pockets) but doessoat -5tohis check.

1.1. Oncea levelhas been attainedinthenew class, the charactercan apportion experience pointsinany manner chosen. Thus, level advancementcanbe uneven.
1.1. When advancinga level, usethe Hit Dice typeforthe classone advancedinto determinethe numberhit points gained. Usingthe fighter/rogue above, the player rollsa d6forhit points when adding theirnew class.
1.1. The character levelisthe accumulated levelsofallthe classes. Soa 4th/4th level rogue/fighterhas 8 character levels. Atthe pointthe 11th character levelis gained, hit point accumulation changes. At this point, hit point accumulationis equaltothe advancementofthe character' classesat 10th leveland beyond. For example, a 5th/5th fighter/rogue gainsa levelof rogueso gains +2hit points, when that character gainsa levelof fighter, they gain +4hit points. **Restrictions**

1. Dual-classed characters takethe besttohit bonusof their classes.
1. Dual-classed charactersusethe least restrictive weapons listfor their classes.
1. Dual-classed charactersusethe most restrictive armor listof their classes.
1. Dual-classed characterscannot combine abilities. For example, a fighter's extra attack means thatthe charactercan makean extra normal attackandnotuse that extra attackto deflect missiles, makea back attackor inspire.

#### Secondary Skills

This section pertainstothe acquisitionand applicationof secondary skillsfor characters. Secondary skillsare bundlesof related skill sets thatcanbe possessedbynon-player charactersand/or characters. These skill bundles representa person's abilityto perform actions withinthe ability description withan expertise greater than those without. Itis importantto note that, when applying this system, the Castle Keeper mustbe aware that those attemptingto perform actions thatare coveredbya secondary abilityor class ability which theydonot possesscannot perform themas wellas other charactersornon-player characters. This allowsthe secondary abilitiesto have some meaninginthe game. To takea modern example, woulditbe reasonablefor someone lackingthe trainingin corporatetaxlawto correctly fillontthe requisitetax formsfora small corporation, much lessa largeone?

For example, the subborning skill includesthe abilityto bribe. Considertwo characters, Aldonsand Bensly, attemptingto bribea local magistrate. Aldonshasthe subborning skilland Bensley doesnot. Briberyisa charisma based skill. So both would makea charisma checkto determineif they successfully bribethe officerofthelaw. because Aldonshasthe subborning skill, heis allowedtoadda bonustohis charisma check. This rollis modifiedby difficultyand other considerationsthe Castle Keepermay deem appropriate.

The following section describes what secondary skillsarein general, howto acquire them, apply secondary skillsinthe game, adjust rolls, a descriptionofthe secondary skillsand adviceon expandingthe listof secondary skills.

**Whatare Secondary Skills**

Secondary Skillsare really bundlesof skills, abilitiesand capabilities that reflector incorporate certain setsof social skills, intellectual abilitiesor physical capacities. For example, bullying affectsa character's abilityto grapple, intimidate, punch, and threaten opponents. As this example shows, secondary skillsarea broadsetof abilities thatcanbe structured underone category. Theseare abilitiesor capacitiesa characterhasand, by possessing them, better ableto perform them than thosewhodonot possess them. **Acquiring Secondary Skills**

Secondary abilitiesare acquiredbyan expenditureof experience points. A character must expend experience pointsto gain these abilities. The experience points expendedcannotbe usedfor class level advancement. The costin experience pointsfor skills depends uponthe typeand levelofthe skill.

Also, skillscanbe improved upon. The first acquisitionofan ability meansthe characterhasa levelone skill. The second acquisitionof that skill indicatesthe characterhasa leveltwo ability. These levelscan increaseas highasthe character desires. Each skill level acquisitionis considered separatefor advancement purposes.

Thereare three classificationsof abilitiesas pertainsto cost: General Skill, Prime Skilland Non-Prime Skill.

General Skill: These abilitiesare opentoall.

Prime Skill: This abilityis prime specificand more easily learnedbya character with that prime.

Non-Prime Skill: This referstothe acquisitionof skills thatare prime specificbut whichthe character doesnot havea prime.

Each Skillhasa base costin experience points. The acquisitionof thin that skill c0sts that amount. Thereafter costisthe base multipliedbythe leveloneis attaining. For example, acquiringa level three prime skill costs 9,000 experience points. Onecan onlygoupa leveloneat time. Onecannotbuy three levelsinone fell swoop. Skill levelscan onlybe gained afterat leastone class levelis attained. For example, a 3rd level charactercan purchasea skillbutcannot purchase another skillor skill level until 4th levelinthe classis attained.

Ability Classification

Costin Experience Points

Prime Skill

3,000

General

5,000

Non-Prime Skill

8,000

For example, a character acquiresone prime specific skillata costof 3,000 experience pointsat 3rd level. The second such skill level then costs 3,000x 2, fora 6,000 total, andifa third such skill levelis acquiredit will cost 9,000 experience points.

**Secondary Skills**

The followingisa listofthe secondary skills availablein Castle Zagyg. We encouragethe Castle Keeperand playersto expand upon this listas necessary, modifyitor even splitthe secondary skillsup into more discrete units. The latteris discussedin 'Using Secondary Skills.'

**Ambush **(dexterity **and **wisdom **- **prime/dexterity **) This ability allowsfor concealment (objectsor person), hiding (in general) and trap construction.

The concealmentand hidingactinthe same mannerasa thief's hide ability. The traps workinthe same mannerasa ranger's Traps ability. This skill also confersa +2toall surprise checks. If thieve'sor rogue's take this ability, theyaddan additional +2

As such, any character with this ability shouldbe ableto note when theyare being offeredabad business deal, poor exchange ratesand understandingofthe complexitiesof taxing lawsto nameafew. Whena characteris presented witha situationin whicha better business dealcanbe madeor business laws mightbe broken they shouldbe allowedto make eitheran intelligence checkor wisdom check (dependingonthe circumstance) to determineif they knowhowto better execute their actions. Further, when making transactionsor tryingto 'hoodwink' othersin business dealings, the recipientofthe character's action should makea saving throwat -2to determineifthe character's proposalsare accepted. Inthe latter case this wouldbe when tryingto exchange gemsor jewelryor other itemsat inflatedor deflated prices.

**Construction (intelligenceand strength - general) This ability refersthe capacityto build, do carpentry, engineering, build fortifications, masonry, mechanicsand assures basic literacyand full numeracy.

This skill givesthe characterornon-player charactera rangeof knowledgein many fieldsof study that other wouldnot likely know. This ability allowsthe characteran intelligence checkto knoworat least know wheretogoto learn abouta particular subjector issue relatedtothe above mentioned subjects. It also increasesthe characters chancesof locating itemsof interstsin antique shops, booksin librariesor other related activities. In casesin whicha charactermay knowofor abouta subjectand specific knowledgeis calledfor, an intelligence check should sufficeto determineifthe character knowsit. As withall skills, the Castle Keeper needstouse their best judgementon whenandhowto apply this skill.

**Forgery **Ability **(dexterity **- **prime/dexterity) This ability affectsa character's abilityto copy, counterfeit, draw duplicatesand fake documents.

Thisis skillsetis fairly restrictedto actsof forgery whether deedsof ownership, heraldic symbols, coinage, papersof heritageand even antique paperwork. When used, the must makea successful dexterity checkto adequately createa forged item. A failure indicated another attempt mustbe made. For thoseonthe receivingendofthe forged item, they must makean intelligence checkat -2per levelofthe forger's secondary skill. Ifitis successful, they notethe forgery.

**Military Leadership (charismaand intelligence - prime/ intelligenceand charisma)** This ability allowsforthe control, direction, guidance, logistics, management, organization, planning, strategyand tacticsin warfare. It also affectsthe capacityto organizeor circumvent problems that might result fromthe managementofan army.

This skill allowsforthe efficient planningand orchestrationofthe movementof large bodiesof troops. For example, efficient logistical chainsare more easily managedand supplies made more availableifone possess this skill. The Castle Keeper must their best judgementinthe practical applicationof this skillasit will generally only come into play whenthe movementof large armies occurs. However, shoulda characterbe responsiblefor provisioninga party, itis likely thatthe possessorof this skillmaynota deficiency. The Castle Keeper should informthe playerof thisifa successful wisdom checkis made. Further, ifa knighthas this ability, his inspire abilityis treatedastwo levels greater thanthe class level.

**Judgment Ability (intelligenceand wisdom - prime/wisdom)** This ability allowsthe detectingof deception, evaluating worth, learning, logic, sophistryand assures literacyand numeracy.

Thisis doneby makingan intelligence checkat +2per levelof ability. Thisis, of course, presumingthe character possessingthe skillcan even knowthe accuracyof that statement. For example, shouldanon-player character makea false claim abouta kingdom whichthe character knows nothingof, thereis little chancehe would knowthe statementwas false. However, the character could makea wsdom checkto determineifthenon-player character were dissimulating.

**Nautical Ability (dexterity, constitutionand intelligence - general) This skillset givesthe possessor superior knowledgeof boating, ship command, diving, fishing (deepand fresh water), navigating, sailing, and swimming.

**Using Secondary Skill**

Theuseof secondary skillsina game will takea creative Castle Keeper. While someofthe skillsare straightforward, othersarenotor involve such general conceptsasto make specific explanationon whenandhowto apply themin their myriad forms, meaningless. That said, some explanation mustbe give.

First, to resolvean issue that involvesanyofthe skills mentioned above doesnot requirea skill check. Often times successis guarantiedorthe Castle Keeper knows whatthe ontcome woldbe. In other casesthe Castle Keeper might wantto propelthe story along some interesting pathand allowforit success. Onlyin those

**Appendix H, Optional rules**

casesin whicha chanceof failure looms large shoulda skill checkbe made. Or, thatis those involving combat. Onceitis decided thata chanceof failureis possible, thena check mustbe made.

To makethe check, the character acting (suchas doing research) simply rollsan appropriate attribute checkandadd +2per skill levelof experience. Soifa characterhas 3 levelsof skill experiencein Thespianism, theyare alloweda +6to their roll. Also, this rollis adjustedbyany appropriate attribute modifiers. Itis importantto note thatthe roll IS NOT adjustedbythe character's class level.

In some instancestheuseofa skills canses anotherto makea saving throw. In this case, the character, monsterornon-player character makesa saving throwbut modifiesthe rollbya -2for each levelof skill experiencethe characterhas. Thisis further adjustedforany attribute modifiers. Whena saving throwis calledfor, the character's levelor monstershit dicedo affectthe roll.

Further, thereare always circumstances than need some modification beyond that mentioned above. Unusual circumstances, the weatherand pure chancecan come into playand effectthe chancesof success. Also, the difficultyofthe situation adjuststhe roll. The followingis offeredasa guidelinefor deciding these modifications.
