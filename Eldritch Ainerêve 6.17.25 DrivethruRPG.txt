Eldritch RPG 2nd Edition represents over a decade of dedicated work by Dan Cross, its
primary author and developer. Building on the foundations of 1st Edition (2008) and
Eldritch Revised (2013), co-authored with Randy Petras, this edition refines the game
mechanics and lore, introducing the versatile Plyphyny System.

The Plyphyny System provides a flexible multi-genre framework supporting diverse
play                                                      styles while emphasizing narrative-driven 
storytelling. This edition serves as the
inaugural fantasy genre book within the Plyphyny system, incorporating and expanding
the Ainerêve setting. Originally enriched by Peter Schaefer in the 2013 Revised Edition,
the setting has been significantly reimagined and expanded by Dan Cross. Creature
entries, first developed by Jon Creffield, have been further expanded with new entries and
refined to align with the evolved system.

As a companion to this edition, a separate, free Player's Handbook is available,
providing                                            streamlined access to the essential rules.

This book is dedicated to my father, Richard Cross, whose rigorous dedication to craft
and                                            unwavering professional standards taught me that 
words, when wielded with care
and purpose, can change worlds - whether in the pages of an investigative report or in
the realms of fantasy. And to Gary Gygax, who showed me that imagination, when
structured with equal dedication, could create entirely new ways to tell stories.

Foreword

ldritch 2nd Edition expands on its
predecessors,                   Eldritch RPG 1st Edition and

Revised, while adopting the later-developed
Plyphyny                         multi-genre system. It streamlines
gameplay, emphasizing narrative and swift action,
while preserving innovative mechanics and
introducing more options and detail. This edition
melds core rules with the rich Ainerêve setting
within the fantasy genre called The Eldritch Realms.
A separate free player's handbook is also available
which provides easy access to the essentials.

The game is story- and action-focused rather than
tactical or “realistic.” The rules encourage
immersion where everybody gets into the
storytelling groove. They allow tremendous
flexibility in the creation of unique characters.

Although the book presents packages to build races
and                           character classes common to epic fantasy,
players will find it easy to build their characters with
any imaginable combination of skills and
background.

Players are not forced into strict archetypes but can
choose from character classes as presented in whole
or part, or may make up their own concept in
collaboration with the Game Master. Furthermore,
no rolled personality traits or moral “alignment”
dictates the players’ choices in gameplay.

As such, player character personalities and talents
evolve                       organically over time. Heroes start powerful
yet are vulnerable without good teamwork, and the
same goes for villains and monsters. The Game
Master (GM) will find that improvising random
encounters or implementing ideas during play is
easy.

The realms of Eldritch showcase the tropes of
fantasy                              and the epic fantasy milieu as a familiar
sandbox while allowing the GM to personalize the
experience.

Ainerêve is the official setting for the game and
further                          expands player choices with an exciting
setting for the GM to use, written by Peter Schaefer,
Jon Creffield, and Dan Cross.

Miniatures and a battle mat are not needed, and
narrative                               is emphasized, but the game is not diceless.
It may look like a lot to learn at first, but once the
mechanics are understood, they serve the story and
fade into the background.

Once familiar with the basic rules, the GM can drop
improvised events or opponents into the action
without a single reference to this book’s pages.

Some role-playing terms are probably known to
most people these days, but a full list of both
common terms and those unique to Eldritch are
defined in the glossary in this book in case you find
something unfamiliar.

Player’s Introduction

Eldritch is a fantasy role-playing game, a social
pastime                             where players assume the roles of
characters seeking adventure together in an
imaginary world. In fantasy, this will be a world of
warriors and wizards, dwarves and dragons, magic
and treasure. The Game Master (GM) describes the
situations that the characters experience. The
players tell him what their characters want to do,
and the GM adjudicates the results of their actions
impartially using the game rules and common sense.
The game proceeds like an interactive story or
screenplay where you choose the path to take.

Players do not need to know all the rules; the GM
takes                               care of that. It does help to have a grasp of the
basic game concepts and mechanics, though, so that
you can make better choices. That is what the next
section covers. Later chapters go into more detail,
and cover special cases, elaborations, and extra rules.

Dice galore

Polyhedral dice are a staple of role-playing games
used                               to generate numbers in certain ranges to

OVERVIEW

Abilities

In Eldritch, skills are divided into three basic
abilities,                           each of which has three specialties. Your


determine various outcomes. In Eldritch, dice are not
only rolled to produce random numbers, but are used
to define proficiency in a skill, the protective value of
armor, or the difficulty of a challenge or casting a
magic spell. The maximum value that can be rolled
on a die or dice for a skill defines several values in
the game as well, such as a character’s ability to
survive combat. Standard dice notation uses “d”
then the number of sides, such as d6 for a six-sided
die. d4+d8 means the sum of a four-sided and an
eight-sided die, 3d6 means the sum of three d6s, and
so on.

Character

In Eldritch you provide the personality and
motivation                                of the character you play in the game.
What your character can do well in game terms is
defined by his or her skills — whether brandishing a
bloody broadsword or wielding mighty magics.

These skills are chosen at character creation and
gained                                 or improved through play. Eldritch offers
bundles of skills and traits (advantages and flaws)
that define common fantasy races and classes for
fast character creation. Simply choose a race and
class then modify the skill set to suit the character.
Once familiar with the game, you may want to opt for
a custom character with whatever skills you think
suit the concept (if the GM agrees!).

proficiency in either is rated by die rank, from d4 up
to                                d12. When attempting an action, you roll the dice
suited to the task, from a basic d4 if you have
minimal skill in that area up to d12+d12 if you are
fantastically talented. There are also two focus areas
for each specialty that add a bonus if they apply. The
ability + specialty + focus applied to a task is called
an ability branch. Generally, the value thus rolled is
compared to another rolled value that depends on
the nature of the challenge or the opposed skill of a
foe. If you get an equal or higher result, you succeed.
Eldritch abilities, specialties, and focuses are as
generic as possible to cover the widest possible range
of actions, rather than having a huge list of specific
skills. They are supplemented by unique skills called
feats that are usually restricted to a class and have
special rules.

Character Points and
Levels

Character points (CPs) are used to buy or upgrade
skills,                            both in character creation and as a campaign
progresses. They are gained by adventuring.

Character levels are a measure of the character’s
overall                     capability and depend on the CP total.

Combat

Eldritch combat is divided into rounds (of about 10
seconds). Attacks within a round usually take place
in order of the basic Prowess ability, highest first.
The attacker rolls dice for the ability tree that applies
to the attack form. The value is the potential harm
(threat points) that could be inflicted. Shield and
armor can negate some or all of the potential harm.
The defender can choose active defense (subsuming
dodge, parry, etc.) to negate more threat points until
too fatigued in that combat. The defender’s passive
defense is affected last. This is how much
punishment the character can take before falling
unconscious, at zero hit points, or dying, at a
negative number equal to the basic Fortitude ability.
Active and passive defenses are the sum of maximum
values of several abilities and specialties, defined in
the Character Creation chapter.

Magic

In most cases, only the Gift of Magic advantage lets
one                               cast spells in the game. Practitioners of magic
fall into two categories, as defined by their focus:
magic-wielder (using magic from arcane sources)
and theurgist (using magic granted by the gods). By
default, a magic-using character can learn only
spells of his own level or lower, so a Level 1 mage
could normally only learn Level 1 (Common) spells
(from any path). You can spend character points to
overcome this limitation. Known spells and their
descriptions are listed in the Magic chapter. Once
familiar with the game, you can use the full magic
rules to have your character create unique spells and
magic items.

Equipment

All characters begin play with equipment appropriate
to                               the life of an adventurer. This includes backpacks,
bedrolls, belt pouches, utility daggers, flint & tinder,
lanterns (and oil), parchment or paper, a pack mule,
and rations that will last a week. Also, sacks, torches,
water skins, whetstones, and wooden poles. There is
more detail in the short equipment section in
Chapter 1.

Money

Monetary transactions in the game world use a
system                                like our modern-day currency; simply
substitute some number of “coins” or “crowns” for
dollars. Assign dollar amounts to items that would be
comparable to things in our own world. For example,
renting a car is not unlike renting a horse in the
medieval context, so charge 50 crowns a day for a
good horse.

Imagine what something is worth today, and
pretend                               that translates into the fantasy economy,
making all conversions easy and fun, even if
unrealistic. Coins weigh an ounce each unless the GM
decides otherwise. $1 is roughly equivalent to 10
copper coins; $50 is roughly equivalent to 5 silver
coins; $500 is roughly equivalent to 1 gold coin.

Glossary

Some terms are nearly universal to role-playing
games                             (PC, NPC, GM, etc.). This book uses these
terms in the conventional sense (defined below for
new gamers). Other terms and acronyms are unique
to the Eldritch Role Playing System. By all means

OVERVIEW

order of basic Prowess ability, fastest to slowest,
from                               d12 (first, in phase 1) down to d4 (last, in phase
5).

Branch Rank: This useful general guideline is a
character’s level of proficiency or power in a single
ability branch, determined by adding up the max-


read this glossary, but it is mainly there for when you
find a term puzzling in context in the main body of
the rules.

Ability: Any skill or trait possessed by a creature.
Most                         often one of the three basic abilities:
Competence, Prowess, and Fortitude.

Ability branch: A single branch of an ability tree: the
ability + specialty + focus applied to a task. A test is
made using such a branch and can incorporate at
most one die for the basic tier, one die for the
specialty, and a bonus for one focus.

Ability test: Most actions use this resolution system
to                           determine an outcome. A creature’s effort may
involve a physical ability or a test of skill; the
challenge may come from the nature of the action or
active opposition. A test uses one chosen ability
branch, with up to two dice rolled by the player to try
to meet or exceed the result of the GM’s challenge
die roll. See Challenge die.

Ability tree: The basic ability rank plus all its
branches.                         Each basic ability (1st tier) has three
specialties (2nd tier), and each specialty has two
focuses (3rd tier).

Advantages: These are useful traits not covered by
standard abilities. They tend to be something the
character purchases only at the time of character
creation. Each advantage usually costs 1 to 3
character points or 1 to 2 CPs per level for advantages
broken into levels. Some advantages are specific to
mythical creatures, and some rare advantages may
be obtained while adventuring.

Battle phase: Part of a combat round. A combat
round                             lasts roughly 10 seconds, divided into five 2-
second battle phases. Combatants act in descending

value of all of the die ranks in the branch.

Branch ranks are as follows:

Weak: 1–3

Average: 4+

Respectable: 12+

Skilled: 16+

Great: 20+

Phenomenal: 24+.

Challenge: The die rank of a test, rolled by the GM
against the player character’s action, ranging from
d4 through d12 depending on the nature of the
challenge. The GM may modify this for unusually
difficult situations, adding another die of equal die
rank for disadvantage. The player’s roll must equal
or beat the GM’s to succeed.

Challenge die levels: Easy: d4, Moderate: d6,
Difficult:                        d8, Demanding: d10, Formidable: d12.

Character class: Each character in Eldritch is
constructed                               by combining a race and an occupational
class typifying one of many adventurers of the land.

Character points (CPs): Points used to build up a
character’s                             abilities. All Player-Adventurer
characters begin with 10 points for customization
after race and class selection. Players can earn points
for involvement, good play, and in-game
achievements every time the game is played. Earned
CPs are used to buy or upgrade skills.

Class level: Class level measures overall capability,
measured                               by the total number of character points
possessed. Each level increases the character’s
proficiency at his or her class feats.

Combat statistics: The rolling of dice and various
number scores simulate combat, representing

4


offensive and defensive actions and resilience
against                     harm.

Different sizes of polyhedral dice representing
different                          abilities are rolled to determine the
outcome of attack actions and to calculate defenses.
The defense pools are scores derived from abilities,
each consisting of a number of hit points. See Die
rank, Ability test, and Defense pool.

Damage reduction (DR): Armor and shields grant
damage                            reduction in addition to the ablative hit
point-based defense pools. Shields reduce threat
points by 1 to 3 points (depending on shield type)
before the chosen active defense is reduced. The
armor reduces threat points that exceed the
defender’s active defense by a die roll depending on
the armor type.

Defense pool (DP): A defense pool is one of two
calculated                           numbers used to mitigate or negate threat
points. The active defense pool is the maximum
value of Prowess + Agility + Melee. The passive
defense pool is the maximum value of Fortitude +
Endurance + Strength. For example, a warrior with
d8 Prowess, d6 Agility, and d8 Melee would have an
Active DP of 22.

Defense, active: All willful and reflexive defensive
actions                            taken by a combatant, such as parrying,
sidestepping, or dodging. This first line of defense
uses the active defense pool, which is rapidly
depleted in combat (simulating fatigue) but is just as
rapidly refreshed once combat ends. Shields are
treated as a form of active defense when readied.

Defense, passive: Any protection afforded to a
creature                            without conscious activation or effort. This
includes armor and the passive defense pool. The hit
points of harm accrued by the passive defense
represent actual damage to mind, body, and soul,
and are slow to heal.

Die rank: This is the die type itself, referring to the
maximum value it can roll, usually equal to the

number of its faces: d3 (below average), d4 (average
human;                              default basic rank), d6, d8, d10, d12 (the
highest rank for standard characters), and d14, d16,
d18, and d20 (special monsters). Die rank refers only
to the value of a single die of any ability tree tier.

Energy points: Most activatable magic items use
stored energy points.

Feats: Maneuvers, powers, and spell-like abilities
unique                          to each character class.

Focus ability: The third and most specific tier of an
ability tree. Each specialty has two focuses. Where a
focus applies, it grants a fixed bonus for a test, or to
potential harm or initiative when attacking.

Focus Item: Focus Items are special items in Eldritch
RPG                             that can be possessed by characters, including
Spell, Battle, and Inspirational Foci. Spell Foci
channel and condense magical energy, while Battle
Foci are used in close combat for critical attacks.

Inspirational Foci can be any item of sentimental or
historical significance that aids spellcasting success.

GM (Game Master): This person runs the game and
has                               the final say over how actions are resolved.

Harm: See Potential harm.

Hit points: Hit points represent how much potential
harm                              a character or creature in the game can
mitigate, negate, or absorb before being killed. See
Defense pool for how this works.

Iconic Items: Iconic Items are special items that can
be                           possessed by characters. There are three types:
Iconic Weapons, Magic Foci, and Inspirational Items.
They aid characters in their abilities and spells
through their mastery die bonuses. Characters may
change which item they designate as their iconic
weapon, spell focus, or inspiring object once per
level.

Maintenance penalty: Maintaining a spell past the
first                            round imposes a penalty of 1 to 5 on other tests

5


OVERVIEW


(except attack rolls and resultant threat points)
while                      concentrating on prolonging the magical
effect. Maintaining more than one spell imposes a
penalty for each such spell.

Mastery die (MD): A character may be able to add a
mastery die to the roll when attempting a class feat
or a chosen path spell, allowing up to three dice
rolled before the focus bonus (if applicable) during a
test. The die rank increases with level (d4 through
d12). This mastery die can be used a limited number
of times per day in combat or challenging
noncombat situations. Any use beyond those limits
costs a number of spirit points equal to the mastery
die rank (see Spirit Points).

Maximum value (Max-value or MV): Each rank has a
corresponding die type, as explained under die rank.
The max-value of each die is simply the highest roll
possible. Thus, the max-value of d4 is 4, of d6 is 6,
d8 is 8, d10 is 10, and d12 is 12.

NPC (Non-Player Character): Any character
controlled                           by the GM and not a player.

Opposed roll (contested challenge): Tests in the
Eldritch                              RPG are resolved by rolling a die (or dice)
and comparing the result to an opposing die roll (the
challenge die or an opponent’s roll); the higher
result wins, with the defender winning a tie.

Opposed rolls are used in any contest of skill
against                                 an active, living opponent (contested roll), or
when making a test to overcome a situational
challenge using a skill or trait, or to cast a spell.

Attack actions are handled differently; see Potential
harm.

PA (Player-Adventurer): A character in the game
who                                is controlled by one of the players. Also referred
to as a Player Character (PC).

Potential harm (attack roll): A dice roll that
generates                             threat points against one or more targets.
A potential harm roll is not an opposed roll. Instead,

threat points ablate the target’s chosen defense
pools                            until the attack penetrates armor, hitting the
body and causing actual harm.

Prowess (initiative): Prowess determines the order
of                             actions during a combat round. Each character’s
turn in battle is determined primarily by his or her
Prowess rank, sometimes modified by weapon
bonuses or other class-based or magical factors. The
final, modified number presents the character’s
initiative score for that round. See Battle phase.

Rank: Level of skill, effect, etc. See Branch rank, Die
rank.

Saving throw: Some spells, innate powers, and
special                            combat feats allow an opposed roll by the
opponent. PCs and NPCs use whatever ability is
needed, adding together the rolls for each die in the
ability branch. Other creatures are assigned a saving
throw rank, a die or die combination that applies to
every situation requiring an opposed roll.

Specialty: The second tier of an ability tree. Each
ability                           has three specialties. In situations where a
specialty applies, it adds an extra die to the ability
die.

Spirit points: These represent a character’s inner
strength,                           hidden reserves, and luck. Characters can
use spirit point actions to gain an inspired advantage
in combat, fuel a complex magical feat or power,
quickly recuperate during battle, cast spells without
training, and invoke impromptu spells outside of
one’s spell repertoire, or activate magic items.

Static bonus: A number from +1 through +5 added to
a                           potential harm roll or test.

Status effect: Any condition caused by an affliction
spell,                         power, or special feat. Some status effects
other than afflictions can be beneficial.

Threat points: This refers to the potential harm
possible from rolling the dice in a specific ability
branch.

Chapter 1:
Characters


o play the game, you need a character
whose                  role you assume. This can be

any fantasy type in Eldritch—a knight in
shining                           armor, a sage grey-bearded wizard, a
nimble thief, a doughty dwarf warrior, a graceful
elven archer—anything that fits the milieu.

Eldritch offers standard fantasy race and class
packages                              for quick character creation, but you
can create your own or with the GM once you
understand how the game works. (Custom races
and classes are discussed in the Game Master’s
section).

To create your character, first get an Eldritch
character                           sheet. Copy the one in these rules or
download one from plyphyny.com (the official
website of Crossroads Games). Come up with a
general idea for the character. Then follow the
steps below, referring to later details as
necessary, and filling out the character sheet as
you go.

Character Points

When creating a character in Eldritch RPG, 2nd
Edition, aim for a well-rounded character with

abilities from different branches. Basic
abilities                    and specialties are ranked on a
scale of d4 to d12, indicating the

character's experience and training.

Characters automatically start with a d4 in
Competence,                         Prowess, and Fortitude. These starting
values are worth 12 Character Points (CPs) but are
assigned for free.

Begin by choosing your race and class. Each race
and                               class provides a bundle of skills, advantages, and
feats, along with automatic minimum die ranks and
focus bonuses.

After selecting your race and class, you receive 10
CPs                                to further customize your character. Use these
CPs to increase abilities and specialties. It costs CPs
equal to the maximum value of the next die rank to
increase a basic ability or specialty one step.

For example, moving from d4 to d6 costs 6 CPs.
Focuses                             grant a static bonus of +1 to +5 and cost 4
CPs per level. Purchase both the basic skill and one of
its specialties to increase your average dice roll
results. You can choose one of the available focuses
for a specialty to tailer your character to what you
envision.

There is no restriction on a specialty being higher
in                               die rank than its associated basic ability, allowing
you to focus on specific aspects of a broader skill.

Flaws are optional but can provide extra CPs for
further customization of your character.

Character Level

Character level represents a full-fledged character’s
overall                        capability, determined by the total number of
character points earned. New characters start at 10
CPs, reflecting the points for initial customization,
to give them a slight starting boost.

Level, CPs, and Mastery Die

Level 1: 10 to 100 CPs [Mastery d4]

Level 2: 101 to 199 CPs [Mastery d6]

Level 3: 200 to 299 CPs[Mastery d8]

Level 4: 300 to 399 CPs [Mastery d10]

Level 5: 400 to 500+ CPs [Mastery d12]

All characters are granted the use of a mastery die, a
roll                                that adds to an ability test during combat or
suspenseful situations. Its increasing die rank
represents the rising power and skill of the
adventurer at each level. The mastery die is limited
in use, invoked during crucial times of great
adversity, highlighting moments of great heroism or
aptitude.

Character Creation Steps

Step 1—Choose Race/Species and Ethnic
Background: Select the character’s species and
ethnic                           background if relevant in the campaign,
noting any advantages, flaws, sex, and age, and enter
the minimum die ranks of listed abilities on the
character sheet.

Step 2—Choose Character Class: Choose your
character                             class and enter the minimum die ranks of
listed abilities on the character sheet, unless the die
rank was already higher because of the race
selection. If a new player, you will see some terms in
the class listing you may not understand; do not
worry about deciphering rules at this stage.

Step 3—Advantages & Flaws: Advantages cost CPs,
usually                                a fixed amount, but sometimes at a cost per
increment, so you can increase that benefit for a
certain number of CPs per stage. The bonus character
points granted by flaws are already figured into the
costs for races, but choosing extra flaws lets you gain
more CPs to spend on other things.

Step 4—Calculate Defense Scores: Your defense
pools                             and spirit points are derived from the
maximum values for ability and one or more
specialties. Enter the values on the character sheet.

The Active defense hit point pool = Prowess + Agility

+ Melee MV.

The Passive defense hit point pool = Fortitude +
Endurance + Strength MV

Spirit Points = Competence + Willpower MV.

Step 5—Refine Character Concept: After those four
steps, it is time to flesh out the narrative concept
with input from the GM, and choose appropriate
equipment for your character’s adventuring life.

Duplicate Ability Ranks and Advantages: When
selecting a race and class combination, duplicate
minimum die-ranks in abilities or named
advantages listed for both can trigger a benefit,

8


granting an extra 2-point advantage or tiering up an
already possessed one. However, die-rank duplicates
cannot increase ability branches, and the benefit can
only be triggered once during character creation,
regardless of the number of matches. Players may
choose to swap a duplicate advantage for another of
equal or lesser value, but any character point
difference is lost.

1. Fantasy Races

Humans: Ainerêve’s most adaptable race is humans,
reflecting                            real-world cultures and societies. From
the bustling cities of Maedoen and Psarmorum to the
frontier settlements of Dalmavand and the Northern
Reaches, they are found everywhere. Their
resourcefulness, ingenuity, and survival skills
influence history across the realms .

Norse-inspired Dwarves: Dwarves are crafty and
resilient.                            These short, muscular humanoids are
skilled miners and smiths who thrive in the harsh
mountains and deep underground caverns of
Grimsete and the Northern Reaches, as well as
within the Sechdraic Mountains of Dalmavand. They
are known for their resistance to poison and
elements, perfect night vision, and martial combat
skills .

Elves: The Seelie elves, under Oberon’s rule, embody
elven                           grace, wisdom, and a symbiosis with nature.

The Unseelie elves, ruled by Mab, exemplify dark
magic                               and necromancy. The Cresylvadran elves have
a deep connection to Echoes Forest and a sacred
covenant with a powerful spirit called the Sylvadran.
The Woodshades, corrupted descendants of elves,
represent the forest’s darker legacy. They are skilled
warriors due to their agility, magic resistance, and
martial weapon skills. Note that all types of alfar are
generally hated in Psarmorum .

Gnomes: European folklore depicts small, clever
gnomes                               as smart and curious. Their superior low-
light vision helps them build intricate underworld

homes in Crossroads and Psarmorum’s labyrinthine
corridors                          filled with magical technology. Despite
their ingenuity, gnomes face hostility in Psarmorum.

Half-elves: Born from human-elf unions, half-elves
represent                      cooperation and diversity. In the
multicultural cities of Maedoen and Crossroads, they
combine the agility and magical resilience of elves
with the endurance of humans, merging the best of
both races. Their presence in Ainerêve suggests
cross-cultural harmony.

Half-orcs: Born from orcs and humans, half-orcs
exist                             between savagery and civilization. Taller and
stronger than humans, they have green skin and
tusks. Mostly found in Grimsete’s borderlands and as
mercenaries in Crossroads’ bustling cities, their
endurance and prowess make them great guards and
foot soldiers, but they struggle with social
acceptance.

Halftings: Small humans with childlike faces but
mature bodies, halflings are mischievous and
roguish. They thrive in both rural and urban areas,
especially in Crossroads and the villages of the
Fertile Glens, as well as in Avinoble. They bring
whimsy and cunning to Ainerêve, emulating the
halflings of classic fantasy role-playing games .

Drakkin: The Drakkin are powerful humanoid
offspring                                of dragons and various sapient creatures.
These beings inhabit the mystical Verdant Expanse
and the remote areas of Castle Astalch. They are
powerful fighters due to their magical breath
weapons and scaly hides, making them formidable in
combat. In regions where they guard mystical
artifacts and sacred sites, their draconic heritage is
revered and feared.

Dwarf             Elf


Dwarves are short, muscular, bearded humanoids,
usually                          four to five feet tall but as wide at the
shoulders as a man. They are renowned as miners
and smiths, and notorious for their love of gold.

Dwarves have resistance to poison and the
elements,                            and all have perfect Night Vision. All

Elves appear as slender, fine-featured humans, but
have                           pointed ears, heightened agility, and greater
resistance to magic. All elves have some innate
ability in the magic arts and have at least one rank in
such a skill.

Most train in some form of martial weapon, usually
(beautifully crafted) swords and (high-quality,
ornate) bows. They are fleet of foot and can see well
in low- light conditions. Elves tend to be either aloof
and haughty, or fun-loving and frivolous, depending
on their clan or bloodline.

Gnomes are a species of small, misshapen, dwarf-
like                             beings who dwell underground. They are

to be highly intelligent.

Stubborn, crafty, and swift on their feet when
confronted                               by superior foes, gnomes are an
ingenious race, building some of the most intricate
underworld homes, typically full of labyrinthine
corridors and unusual magical technology.

Observant.

Flaw: Restriction: small weapons only.

agility                            and resistance to magic than is usual for
humans and greater endurance than is usual for
elves.

Half-elves tend to be shorter than the average
human,                             with slightly pointed ears. All half-elves
have Low-light Vision.

Half‑Orc          Halfling


The result of a union between an orc and a human,
these                      demi-humans are usually larger and stronger
than average humans and, like orcs, are green-
skinned with tusks protruding from their lower jaw.

They are prized as guards and foot soldiers for their
natural endurance and prowess despite having the
flaw of being ugly (by human standards).

Base die ranks: Fortitude d6 → Strength d8 →

Ferocity (+1) + Endurance d6.

Advantages: Low-light Vision, Intimidation,
Menacing.

Flaw: Ugliness.

but the adults have unmistakably mature physiques.
Halflings are generally mischievous and roguish.

Base die ranks: Competence d6 → Adroitness d6 →
Cleverness (+1). Fortitude d6 → Willpower d4 →
Courage (+1).

Advantages: Low Light Vision, Read Emotions,
Resilient.

Flaw: Restriction: small weapons only.

combination,                                                 without inherent superiority of humans 
or preference for a particular ethnicity,
contrary to default European medieval society conventions.

CHARACTERS

Human          Drakkin


Homo sapiens, the most recognizable primates of
any                            fantasy world, usually enjoy military supremacy
because of their tenacity, fecundity, and penchant
for war.

Humans are usually the most influential sentient
creatures                           globally, owing to their resourcefulness,
resolve, supreme inventiveness, and incredible
knack for survival against all odds.

Base die ranks: Competence d6. Prowess d6 → Melee

inheritance of a magical breath weapon and scaly
hides providing a natural 1d4 armor (added to any
being worn).

mastery over death allows them to command
undead, inflict debilitating conditions, and
manipulate the energies of decay. They embody the
terrifying potential of theurgy when used for
malevolent ends.

16


Adept

Adepts are the experts, alchemists, artificers, bards,
loremasters, and scholars of the world. Adventurous
merchants and explorers are also counted among
their ranks. Whether they are polymaths with a
wealth of knowledge keen to unravel mysteries,
tacticians who can turn the tide of a battle, or
savants researching and creating new spells and
magic items, they are highly sought after for their
expertise.

While their primary brand of magic is Arcanum —
including crafting, artifice, wards, glyphs, hexes,
and alchemy — they are also capable of casting
Wizardry spells.

Base die ranks: Competence d6 → Adroitness d4 →
Cleverness (+1) + Expertise d6 → Wizardry (+1) +
Perception d4 → Perspicacity (+1).

Advantages: Arcanum, Gift of Magic, Literacy,

Assassins are skilled killers who often work as lone
mercenaries or bounty hunters, taking contracts for
murder throughout the realms. They excel in

of poisons and their ability to strike from the
shadows.

These deadly professionals are known for their
agility,                            quick thinking, and proficiency with ranged
weapons like the bow or crossbow. In addition, they
are experts in the use of concealable weaponry,
stealth, and hand-to-hand combat. A sharp
perception and the ability to stay hidden and
undetected are essential traits for any successful
assassin.

Base die ranks: Competence d4 → Adroitness d6 +
Perception d4. Prowess d4 → Agility d4 + Vitality d6

17


Barbarian

CHARACTERS

Mage


Barbarians are savage fighters, known for their
brutal                              battle tactics and berserker rage. While they
may hail from less civilized lands, those who become
adventurers have adapted to a more complex life.

They are not mere savages, plunderers, or bandits.
With                            honed combat skills and a fierce determination,
barbarians are capable of taking down even the most
formidable of foes.

Base die ranks: Prowess d6 → Melee d8. Fortitude d4

→ Strength d4 → Ferocity (+1).

Advantages: Animal Affinity, Brutishness,
Menacing,               Resilient.

Feats: Berserk, Brawl, Feat of Strength, Grapple.

Mages study ancient grimoires and occult knowledge
to                              cast reality-altering spells, specializing in one of
three paths: Thaumaturgy, Elementalism, or
Sorcery, which determine the spells they can
augment with level mastery.

Wizardry is a key focus for mages, representing a
tremendous amount of knowledge and training in
manipulating magic, extending to proficiency in
artificing, curses, potions, wards, and necessary
material components.

Mages also possess important feats in Arcane
Finesse                            and Dweomercraft, allowing them to fine-
tune spells and amplify their effects, respectively.

Base die ranks: Competence d6 → Expertise d8 →
Wizardry (+1). Fortitude d4 → Willpower d6 →
Resistance (+1).

Advantages: Arcanum, Gift of Magic, Magic Defense,
Scholar.

18


Mystic

Mystics possess a powerful connection to the
magical                             energies of the world, specializing in the
path of Mysticism, which allows them to cast spells
of incredible potency. They are encountered as
mysterious travelers, warriors, or contemplatives
with extraordinary powers of the mind. Unlike Mages
and Theurgists, who often diversify their magical
studies, Mystics concentrate on spiritual knowledge
and power through mysticism and psychogenics.

Although their primary expertise lies in their own
mystical practices, Mystics have the ability to learn
spells from other wizardry paths. However, when
casting spells outside their class, they experience the
same spell failure mechanics as other practitioners.

Base die ranks: Competence d6 → Expertise d6 +
Wizardry (+1). Prowess d4 → Melee d4 Fortitude d4→
Endurance d6 → Resilience (+1) & Vitality (+2).

Advantages: Empathic, Gift of Magic, Intuitive,
Magic                   Resistance (Lesser), Strong-Willed.

Feats: Iron Mind, Path Mastery (Mysticism),
Premonition,                        Psychic Powers.

19

Rogue

Rogues are independent-minded individuals who
thrive                               on the outskirts of society. They possess sharp
thieving skills, cunning, and a talent for deception,
making them highly valued in criminal
organizations and situations that require stealth and
subterfuge.

Resourcefulness and good fortune are traits that
come naturally to rogues, allowing them to easily
navigate obstacles and seize opportunities that
others might miss. Their expertise in urban
environments and criminal networks makes them
highly effective in such settings.

In addition, rogues possess unique abilities, such as
dealing extra damage, evading danger, manipulating
others, and moving discreetly and unnoticed.

Base die ranks: Competence d4 → Adroitness d4 →
Skulduggery (+1) + Perception d4. Prowess d6 →
Agility d8.

Advantages: Expeditious, Fortunate, Streetwise,
Underworld                         Contacts.

Feats: Backstab, Evasion, Roguish Charm, Stealth.


Theurgist

CHARACTERS

Warrior


Theurgists are warrior ecclesiastics whose faith fuels
their                              gift of magic, devoted to a pantheon or specific
god (or Nature as a divinity). The class's clothing,
weapons, and armor vary depending on the
prevailing culture and the chosen magic path, either
Druidry or Heiraticism.

Theurgy is a focus skill of the class, allowing
theurgists                                to invoke supernatural spiritual sources to
restore, revive, heal, vivify, or otherwise affect living
things. They can also use this focus to animate the
dead or inflict death, disease, and decay. Theurgy
represents the two sides of the coin of restoration
and life or destruction and decay, and theurgists
must choose which path to follow.

Base die ranks: Competence d8 → Expertise d4 →

Theurgy (+1). Fortitude d6 → Willpower d4.

Advantages: Gift of Magic, Magic Defense, Religion,
Strong-Willed.

Feats: Divine Healing, Path Mastery (Druidry or
Heiraticism), Spiritual Smite, Supernatural
Intervention.

Warriors are of many types. Some are ordinary
fighters                               or fencing masters who excel at swordplay
or brawling. Others may be ordinary soldiers and
men-at-arms, local deputy marshals or constables,
military officers, landless or landed knights, or
high-ranking naval or military officers.

They are among the most powerful defenders of
human                            realms against the supernatural, with greater
resistance to magic than other classes.

Base die ranks: Prowess d8 → Melee d6 → Threat
(+1).                       Fortitude d6.

Advantages: Commanding, Intimidation, Magic
Resistance (+1), Tactician.

Feats: Battle Savvy, Maneuvers, Stunning Reversal,
Sunder                          Foe.

20


Character Class Feats

Each class lists special feats. A character of a
particular                              class may, at any time, attempt any feat
listed for that class. Class feats are executed or
activated by rolling a test versus the feat’s challenge
die.

The challenge die varies depending on the power

Level
1

2

3

4

5

Mastery Uses Per Day
2

4

6

8

10


level of the feat chosen. Every feat requires the roll of
one of the three main abilities; either Competence,
Prowess, or Fortitude, plus any listed specialty die,
then adding any class-based modifiers or focus
bonus.

For example, if a warrior chooses to use the
Focused                              Strike feat, he will roll his Prowess plus
Melee dice, add any bonus based on Focus, and check
the result against the challenge die result.

Feats that alter combat by imposing major afflictions
or                           bypassing active defense require expending a
mastery die. To activate such feats, players must
spend one mastery die to add to the ability test. If no
mastery die uses remain, players can spend spirit
points equal to their mastery die rank (MV) for one
additional use. The feat only expends Spirit Points
upon successful activation, not if it fails.

Mastery Die

The number of times a character can use the mastery
die                               per day increases with their level. The mastery
die can be used up to twice per day at level 1, up to
four times per day at level 2, up to six times per day
at level 3, up to eight times per day at level 4, and up
to ten times per day at level 5.

The player always chooses whether to use the
mastery                             die or not, and each use can be applied to
any situation or combat encounter, with no
limitation on the number of times it can be used
within a single encounter or situation, as long as it
doesn't exceed the total daily usage.

Duplicate Ability Ranks and
Advantages

Race and class selections provide base die ranks, not
cumulative bonuses. Identical ranks or advantages
from both selections grant a one-time benefit: an
extra 2-point advantage or an upgrade. This doesn't
increase ability branches, and any point difference
from swapping a duplicate advantage is lost. These
ranks are your abilities' starting points, not added
bonuses.

Multi-class Characters

At Level 3, a character may choose to purchase a feat
from another class, provided they meet all the
minimum die-ranks for that class and have a good
narrative reason for it. The cost of purchasing a feat
from another class is keyed to character level. At 3rd
level, it costs 8 character points, 6 CPs at 4th level,
and 4 CPs at 5th level.

Keep in mind that the Gift of Magic is required to
even                            consider purchasing spellcasting-related feats
from another class, and it is an early character
creation choice. The implementation of multi-
classing is a collaborative effort between the player
and GM, and a great deal of narrative justification is
necessary in the campaign.

CHARACTERS


3. Advantages and Flaws

Advantages are useful character traits. Flaws are
hindering                           traits. Some are innate or background-
specific and can be acquired only at character
creation. For example, a creature either has Night
Vision or not. Rarely, advantages may be obtained or
flaws incurred while adventuring.

Advantages

Advantages are traits that help a character in some
way                            (usually those capacities and aptitudes ill-suited
to the two-tiered Basic → Specialty skill structure).

Each advantage costs character points (usually 1 to 3)
to                              acquire unless granted by the chosen race or class.
A few advantages are optionally broken into levels,
costing 1 to 4 character points apiece.

Animal Affinity (2 CPs): Grants +2 to any
Competence → Expertise roll concerning natural
fauna                              lore, or involving practical animal handling,
such as riding, training animals, or taming wild
beasts.

Arcane Inheritance (4 CPs): The Iconic Arcane
Inheritance                        advantage allows 1st-level characters to
enhance their chosen iconic item or weapon with
inherent magical properties, passed down from an
ancestor or discovered during a significant event.

This inherent magic is resilient and cannot be
dispelled                               by any known means. The item's magical
properties are determined during character creation
and can be further augmented as the character
progresses.

Arcanum (4 CPs): Arcanum is the study of using
magical                          formulae to create magic items, potions,
arcane glyphs, and wards. It grants +2 to any
Competence → Expertise roll when creating or using
such. Arcanum is more craft than art, and in theory,
arcanists follow the prescribed rituals, prepare the
magical ingredients when the stars are right, chant

the ancient phrases, and so on, as if following a
recipe.                                 If all is correct, it works, but not everyone can
follow a recipe, and when invoking mystic forces, the
results of failure can be more than a burned pot.

Only those who have the advantage of the Gift of
Magic may purchase Arcanum if it is not already
granted by their character class.

Attractiveness (2 CPs): Others find the PC beautiful
or                           handsome and thus tend to react well to the PC.
This ranked advantage ranges from a d4 to a d12, at 2
CPs per level. The PC can attempt to manipulate
NPCs with an opposing die roll vs. Fortitude →
Willpower → Courage.

Brutishness (2 CPs): Grants +1 per 2 CPs, up to +4, to
potential harm in any form of unarmed combat. The
bonus also applies to any opposed rolls in unarmed
combat.

Commanding (2 CPs): Grants +2 to Competence rolls
when directing troops or planning alongside allies.

Eidetic Memory (2 CPs): Grants +2 to learning a new
spell                                 or recalling facts (Competence → Perception vs.
challenge die).

Empathic (2 CPs): Grants +2 to Competence →

Perception rolls when reading somebody’s emotions.

Expeditious (2 CPs): Grants +2 to all Prowess →

Agility → Speed rolls when running or sprinting.

Fortunate (4 CPs): The character tends to be very
lucky.                          Re-roll every result of 1 on any test or threat
die (attack) roll (once per day).

Gift of Magic and Magic Defense (8 or 12 CPs):
Characters                              with the Gift of Magic advantage gain the
ability to cast spells. Tier 1 of the advantage allows
the casting of wizard or theurgist spells, while Tier 2
provides access to the Magic Defense benefit. If a
character’s race and class both have the Gift of Magic
advantage, he or she automatically gains access to
Tier 2.

22


Magic Defense allows magic-wielders to use their
Active                           Defense Pool to create a protective energy that
shields them from non-physical magical damage
such as psychic attacks. This can make a difference
in reducing or blocking harm from magical sources.

However, Magic Defense (12 CPs) does not protect
against                             magical effects that require a saving throw,
such as Affliction effects. In such cases, the caster
can use the Competence → Expertise → Wizardry or
Theurgy branch to attempt to mitigate the effect of
the Affliction effect spell with an opposed roll.

Heightened Senses (2+ CPs): The character’s senses
(sight,                              vision, taste/smell, touch) are superior to
those of the average member of his species. The PC
can choose one heightened sense for every 2 CPs.

This allows a +1 bonus on ability tests using the
heightened sense (most likely Competence →
Perception, but other abilities might be affected).

Inconspicuous Caster (2 CPs): This advantage
requires                               Gift of Magic as a prerequisite. Spells are
usually cast with dramatic words and gestures,
making magic use obvious. Sometimes mages may
wish to be subtler and avoid one or both, but it is
difficult, with a normal penalty of –4 to the test if
dropping either words or gestures, and –6 to cast
with neither. This advantage halves the penalties to
–2/–3. It is most useful if the caster is silenced or
restrained somehow, e.g., bound and gagged. If used
combined with a basic Harm effect spell attack, a
challenge die vs. d4+2 (silent) or d4+3 (silent and
still) is required to succeed.

Intimidation (2 CPs): Grants +2 to Fortitude ability
rolls,                         invoking the character’s powerful presence to
dominate or resist.

Intuitive (2 CPs): Grants +2 on Perception branch
checks                         (including for other advantages, such as Read
Emotions).

Linguist (2 CPs): Grants +2 to Competence rolls
when                        attempting to speak or understand (but not
read or write) any common spoken language in the

milieu. A PC who wants to learn rare, ancient, or
arcane                          languages can purchase that extra depth of
skill at 1 CP for each of the three.

Literacy (1–2 CPs): The ability to read written
language                               (1 CPs for literacy in one language and 2
CPs for all languages one knows). Note the PC must
be able to speak a language to be literate in it. One
may take this advantage once for each language one
is literate in, or just spend two points and assume
nominal literacy in all languages one knows.

Lorekeeper (2 CPs): Your character has a natural
talent                                for acquiring and retaining knowledge. You
have a +2 bonus to any Competence → Expertise roll
involving researching, recalling, or analyzing
information, especially related to history, culture,
magic, and legends. In addition, once per session,
you may ask the GM for a hint or clue related to the
current situation, based on your character's intuition
and understanding of the world. The GM will provide
a useful piece of information or insight that can aid
your party in their endeavors.

Magic Defense: see Gift of Magic.

Magic Resistance (2 or 4 CPs): Lesser magic
resistance                                 (2 CPs) boosts saving throws against
magical afflictions that affect the body or mind by +1.
Some races have this as a granted advantage, and
otherwise a good story for this advantage is
encouraged. Magical afflictions are described in
GM’s section. The Greater Resistance tier (4 CPs)
boosts saves against d10 and d12 magical afflictions
by +2. This includes Control Mind, Possess Spirit,
Paralyze, and Incapacitate. Each level can only be
purchased once, and bonuses do not stack (+1 or +2
to save, not +3).

Menacing (2 CPs): Grants +2 on Competence →
Perception                             (where it involves gauging susceptibility
to coercion) or Fortitude → Strength → Ferocity or
Might rolls.

Mythic Physiology (GM fiat): This is a species
advantage                         that grants the character supernatural

23


CHARACTERS


traits and abilities, reflecting their magical or
ancestral                           heritage. The abilities can include
Elemental Affinity, Natural Armor, or Enhanced
Senses, and may be inspired by creatures like
demons, dragons, or other mythical beings. These
traits are typically incorporated into the character's
concept or species choice during character creation.
For example, a character with Mythic Physiology
may be a half-demon or a dragonkin, gaining
enhanced Strength, Agility, or Endurance, as well as
resistance to magical attacks or the ability to wield
magic.

While Mythic Physiology can be advantageous in
combat and other situations, it also comes with
challenges and drawbacks. Others may fear or
discriminate against the character due to their
supernatural abilities, and their powers may have
unique limitations or side effects (see Unsettling
Flaw).

Mythic Vision: Magical Vision (2 or 4 CPs or GM
fiat):                               This advantage enhances the character's vision
in low-light or complete darkness conditions.

Typically, these innate abilities are unavailable for
purchase, but those characters desiring such may
have them if the GM allows.

Low-light Vision (2 CPs) allows the character to see
well in dim lighting conditions, including starlight,
without penalties to ability tests in combat and other
situations.

Night Vision (4 CPs) allows the character to see
perfectly in the dark without the aid of torches or
lanterns, such vision extending out to 60 feet.

Natural Talent (2 CPs): Grants +2 to all Competence

→ Expertise checks, for instance on Linguistic tests.

Observant (2 CPs): Grants +2 on Competence →

Perception → Perspicacity.

Read Emotions (2 CPs): Grants insight into a target’s
motivations and emotional state, especially useful if
that is at odds with behavior. Uses Competence as the

basic ability. If the character is also intuitive, add +2
to                                the roll.

Religion (2 CPs): Knowledge of the beliefs, customs,
and                            rituals surrounding the organized worship of a
deity or pantheon. Includes understanding of holy
days, forms of sacrifice or propitiation, and priestly
hierarchies.

Resilient (2 CPs): (fast Healer) The character heals
passive                            defense points at twice the normal rate.
(Such fast healing is 2 hit points per day of rest or 4
hit points per day of total bed rest.)

Scholar (2 CPs): Grants +2 on all Competence →
Expertise                           checks for class-based knowledge. This
will be legends & lore for adepts and mages, strategy
& tactics for warriors, and so on, as decided by the
GM.

Sense of Direction (1 CPs): This is the innate ability
to                              find one’s way. A character with this advantage
can always find true north and know what direction
he faces underground or total darkness. One with
this advantage can also sense direction in
directionless places, such as magical mazes and
extra-planar realms.

Streetwise (2 CPs): Grants +2 on all Competence →
Adroitness rolls for social interaction in challenging
urban situations.

Strong-willed (2 CPs): +2 on Fortitude → Willpower

→ Courage rolls.

Survival (2 CPs): Allows the character to survive in
the                           wilderness, finding food, water, and shelter. (All
adventurers have the basic tier Competence ability in
Survival.) Purchase of the advantage grants a bonus
of +1 through +5, at 2 CPs per level, to survival
checks, including understanding hazards, exploring
areas to scout out information, and tracking and
observing creatures.

24


Tactician (2 CPs): Allows the character to swap out
Prowess for Competence when performing a battle
maneuver involving an opposed roll (Prowess →
Melee) and add +2 to the ability test. Does not apply
to potential harm.

Underworld Contacts (1 CPs): The character knows
several                            shady characters in less than reputable lines
of work. In new locations, the character will know
where to find such persons. The GM controls all such
contacts.

Flaws

The opposite of advantages, flaws are traits that
hinder                               a character in some way. When selecting a
flaw, a character gains between 1 to 4 character
points to use in character creation.

These bonus CPs are available at character creation
only.                         Acquiring a flaw through gameplay does not
award any points.

The number of flaws any PC possesses to start with
should not exceed 4 CPs in total.

Addiction (1–3 CPs): The character is addicted to
some                          substance. The character will spend at least an
hour a day using the substance and spend a good
portion of income acquiring it. It is possible to get
clean from an addiction, but the character will have
to make a Courage roll in times of great stress to
avoid returning to the substance. Addiction may be
acquired as a 1 CP, 2 CPs, or 3 CPs flaw.

If the character is forced to go for two days without
the                             object of a 1-point addiction, all actions are at –1
penalty and will increase by an additional –1 for
every two days that pass without using the
substance. A 2-point addiction lowers any test by –2
for every three days without the object of addiction
and a 3-point addiction lowers any test by –3 for
every four days.

Note that addictive substances often have other
effects                              on the character’s behavior.

Clumsy (1 CP): The character is physically awkward
and                        uncoordinated (1 CP), although training can
help. Agility and Vitality die ranks are counted as one
less (d4 counts as a d2, d12 counts as a d10).

Compulsion (1–3 CPs): This flaw is much like an
addiction but to an activity, not a substance. A
compulsive PC will constantly try to perform the
stated behavior and will do so at any opportunity.

Examples of a compulsive person are a pyromaniac,
a                          pathological liar, and a problem gambler. The
Compulsion flaw causes the same penalties as the
Addiction flaw, and it may be acquired as a 1 CP, 2
CPs, or 3 CPs flaw.

Debility (2 CPs): Impairment due to mundane and
magical                             allergies and phobias which impair skill use
when the allergen or feared thing is present (this
should be common, e.g., a primary color, a path of
magic, fire, garlic, heights, mirrors, plants, rats,
silver, snakes, spiders, sunlight, swords, undead,
water). One less die rank on any test or attack.

Dim-witted (1 CP): The character is slow on the
uptake                                (1 CP), although training can help. Adroitness
and Perception die ranks are counted as one less (d4
counts as a d2, d12 counts as a d10). Some individuals
are just born rather stupid.

Frail (1 CP): The character is unrobust and prey to
illness,                         influence, etc. (1 CP), although the
adventuring life can help. Vitality and Willpower die
ranks are counted as one less (d4 counts as a d2, d12
counts as a d10).

Impaired Hearing (1–3 CPs): A character with this
flaw                              does not hear as well as others. He is at a –1
penalty to any skill in which hearing is required (1
CP). Optional levels are available at the GM’s
discretion. For 2 CPs, the character is at –2 for skills
involving hearing. At the 3-point level, the character
is completely deaf and may not make hearing rolls.

This can affect the cost and availability of skills
based                              on hearing, like specialty in Music (GM’s
discretion).

25


CHARACTERS


Impaired Smell and Taste (1 CP): The character
cannot                             smell or taste anything (1 CP). The character
cannot detect anything through these senses but is
also unaffected by bad smells, like the stench of a
skunk, a stagnant, noisome sewer, the putrid smell
of rotting fish, and so on.

Impaired Vision (1–3 CPs): This flaw requires the
character to use mechanical aid to see clearly (i.e.,
spectacles or magical goggles of some kind).

Without glasses or the equivalent, the character is
at                                 a –1 penalty to any skill that requires sight (1 CP).
Optional levels are available at the GM’s discretion.
For 2 CPs, the character is at –2 penalty for sight
skills when unaided by artificial lenses. At the 3-
point level, the character is completely blind and
may not make sight rolls. Such a character needs
significant powers to compensate for blindness, and
would likely have to learn magic, and focus on spell
types that enhance the senses.

Restriction (1 CP): This is any strong limitation on
normal adventuring activities due to physical,
mental, or magical characteristics, as arbitrated by
the GM. Examples include the use of small weapons
only (small beings), the inability to use iron weapons
or armor (magical creatures), or edged or ranged
weapons (some religions or codes).

Missing Limbs (2 or 3 CPs): A character can have one
missing limb at most to remain viable. IMO

Missing Arm (2 CPs): The character is without the
use                                 of an arm. It need not be completely missing but
is not usable in any way. Tasks that require the use of
two hands are all but impossible. The character
cannot wield two weapons at once, including small
shields, and he can never master two-handed
weapons, which are always wielded at –2.

Missing Leg (3 CPs): The character is without a leg
He                                can walk with either an artificial leg or crutch at –
1 penalty in battle phase initiative.

Mundane (1 CP): The character is just not that good
at                              magic (1 CP), although training can help. Expertise

die rank is counted as one less (d4 counts as a d2, d12
counts as a d10), and saving throws are at –1.

Mute (2 CPs): The character is unable to speak. No
spells                               are possible that require the use of speech, nor
skills where speech is important. This is ideal for the
player who just had his jaw wired shut due to some
freak accident.

Old (1 or 3 CPs): The character is experienced but
past                                 the prime of life (1 CP). The character has a
penalty of –1 to Strength and Vitality and heals at
half normal rates: 1 hp per 2 days’ rest, or 1 hp per
day bed rest. Optionally, the flaw can be taken twice
for an ancient greybeard or wizened crone (3 CPs). If
so, an extra penalty of –1 to Agility and Perception
applies, and the character heals more slowly: 1 hp per
3 days’ rest, or 2 hp per 3 days bed rest. Magic
healing works normally.

Ugliness (1 CP): The character has an appearance
characteristic                            that is unappealing in some way. The
character has a hunchback, crossed eyes, bowed legs,
or is just plain ugly. This will often cause a –1 penalty
to social reaction. A character may take this flaw up
to three times at 1 CP per level of ugliness

Unsettling (2 CPs): Your character's appearance or
demeanor is unsettling to others. This could be due
to demonic or monstrous features, an unsettling
aura, or something else. At level 1 (1 CP), your
character causes a -1 penalty to social reaction rolls
when meeting new people, except for those who are
familiar with your character's appearance. At level 2
(2 CPs), the penalty increases to -2.

Note that some NPCs may react negatively or even
violently to your character, depending on the setting
and the GM's discretion.

Weak (1 CP): The character is puny and lacks muscle
(1                               CP), although training can help. Melee and
Strength die ranks are counted as one less (d4 counts
as a d2, d12 counts as a d10).

4. Calculate Defense Pools

A Defense Pool is a quantity of hit points used to
mitigate                              or negate threat points. There are two
defense pools, the active defense pool (representing
actions like parrying, dodging, or “rolling with the
punches”) and the passive defense pool
(representing actual physical and mental damage).

Spirit points represent a character’s inner reserves
and                             luck and can be used in many ways, often to pull
something out of the bag when needed.

Your character’s defense points and spirit points
are                           calculated based on the total maximum values of
the specified abilities and specialties. Remember, the
Max-Value of each die is simply the highest roll
possible. Thus, the MV of d4 is 4, of d6 is 6, and so
on.

Active defense pool = Prowess MV + Agility MV +

Melee MV.

Passive defense pool = Fortitude + Endurance +
Strength MV.

Spirit Points = Competence MV + Willpower MV.
Competence MV + Willpower MV.

5. Refine Character
Concept

The character concept is worked out in cooperation
with                               the GM. Attributes like intellect, charm, and
insight are up to the player to determine and
communicate; the rules do not quantify them. Nor
are there rules to dictate whether the character relies
more on brute strength or adroitness and agility in
battle. The player has full freedom to interpret these
attributes within the scope of his desired character
concept.

Gender/Age

Human characters most often begin their
adventuring                            careers during their youth, but players
may create a new character of any age. Flaws can
simulate old age problems if the player and GM
desire, but there are no strict penalties for creating
elderly characters. The GM must approve older
characters with assumed experience so as not to
grant a single player an unfair advantage.

Starting Equipment

Each character starts with the following items:

•A set of ordinary clothes and a purse of 5 gold coins.

•A backpack, plus a large and small sack.

•A week’s rations, waterskin, and tinderbox.

•A small dagger or hunting knife.

•50' rope, iron spikes, and a small hammer.

•Either 6' traveling staff or 10' pole.

•Either hooded lantern and 2 oil flasks or d4+1
torches.

Beyond the common equipment, each character
starts                         with one of these packs by class:

Adept: One book of knowledge in the character’s area
of                           expertise other than ritual magic.

Assassin: Assassin hood, jacket, cape, robe, or tunic.
Barbarian: Garments made of woven wool or linen,
trousers, a tunic, overcoat or cloak, or long tunic

with a belt.

Mage: One spellbook, staff, or some focus item
depending on the type of magic practiced.

Mystic: Robes or shawl with the front and the back
decorated, cloak, or any loose garments allowing
freedom of movement. Armor up to leather.

Rogue: One set of thieves' tools, light armor (up to
leather), and one weapon.

27


CHARACTERS


Theurgist (priest): one prayer book, holy relic or
symbol, a focus item, and one suit of armor up to
chain.

Theurgist (Druid): Robes, cloak, staff, and one
common weapon.

Warrior: One weapon of choice. Also, one suit of
armor up to chain, a small to large shield, and a
steed. Plate armor may be agreed upon with GM
based on character background.

The reason for a short equipment section is that
mundane                               items do not require excruciating detail —
the stock-in-trade of adventurers is mostly
weapons, magic, and armor. Accordingly, the rules
cover these items thoroughly. Normal treasure takes
many forms during an adventure, but players usually
convert loot into regular currency without fanfare.

Iconic Props

In the game world, personal iconic items such as
magical                            weapons and foci offer various benefits,
including attack options, permitting the use of the
mastery die, and the potential for master twist
effects. Magic foci enable mages, mystics, and
theurgists to channel magical currents, enhancing
combat prowess or spellcasting abilities with spirit
points. Iconic items come in diverse forms, ranging
from melee weapons for barbarians to gemstone
rings for adepts, and from inspirational objects like
symbolic tattoos for assassins to heirloom lockets
for theurgists. Other examples include ancestral
journals for mages, totem animal fur scarves for
barbarians, ancient maps for rogues, and blessed
prayer beads for mystics.

These personalized items help define a character's
identity,                        deepening their connection to their chosen
iconic item and augmenting their abilities. The GM
may approve or deny a character's background or
items beyond the iconic item. Players can dress their
character as they see fit, but acquiring magic items
for starting characters requires GM approval for
specific reasons (see Iconic Inheritance, page 173) .

Choosing an Iconic Item

The GM can approve or deny other things based on a
character’s proposed background. Clothes can be
whatever the player imagines are appropriate for his
character. The GM should not grant magic items to
starting characters unless having a special reason to
do so.

Players can choose nonmagical iconic items for
their                          characters during creation, while magical
iconic items can be purchased with character points
or found during an adventure and deemed "iconic"
once a new level is gained.

Iconic item benefits

Iconic Weapon Bonus: This bonus grants a static +1
threat point to the attack roll per character level,
enhancing the potential harm output. For example, a
level 3 character wielding an iconic axe would indeed
add +3 to their attack roll’s potential harm.

Damage Type Focus Bonus: Further bonuses are
applied if the character possesses a focus aligning
with their Iconic Weapon's damage type. For
example:

Crushing: Add Might (Strength) focus.
Slashing/Cutting:                            Add Ferocity (Strength) focus.

Impaling: Add Speed (Agility) focus, or Skullduggery

(Adroitness) if a Rogue.

Specialist Bonus: Characters specializing in combat
(Melee                                or Precision) gain an additional bonus to
potential harm via their focus. Melee specialists add
their Threat focus bonus and Precision specialists
add their Ranged Threat focus bonus.

Stacking Focus Bonuses: These bonuses stack,
meaning                       characters benefit from both their Iconic
Weapon Bonus and Damage Type Focus Bonus, in
addition to any Specialist Bonus from combat
specialization. For instance, a level 3 warrior with
the Ferocity focus using an Iconic axe would gain
bonuses from the following:

28


.

Iconic Master Twist: An additional roll of the
mastery                                die is granted, adding its result to the total.
For weapons and battle foci, this translates to
increased threat points, boosting damage output. For
other objects and inspiring foci, it enhances the
success rate of ability tests, representing heightened
skill or a stroke of luck.

Inspirational Aid: Iconic items with emotional or
historical                              value can enhance a character's likelihood
of success on any ability test or a designated class
feat.

While these items cannot be used for attack
actions                           or feats, they can be employed for non-
damaging spells during battle. Inspirational
items infused with spirit points bestow
temporary bonuses when used. Here is a list of

potential nonmagical and potentially magical iconic
items                                for each class:

Nonmagical Iconic Items:

Adepts: Personalized grimoires, ornate crystal orbs,
and                           wands crafted from rare woods.

Assassins: Customized throwing knives, stylish
cloaks,                        and poison vial necklaces.

Barbarians: Totem animal pelts, necklaces made of
bear claws, and intricately designed metal shields.

Mages: Unique focus items, elegant rings, and
decorative potion bottles.

Mystics: Beautiful prayer beads, carved staffs, and
holy symbols with detailed engravings.

Rogues: Artisanal lockpicks, cloaks with hidden
pockets, and lightweight boots.

Theurgists: Holy relics with intricate designs, ornate
prayer                              beads, and exquisite potion bottles.

Warriors: Weapons with distinctive shapes or
engravings,                          shields with unique symbols, and armor
forged with an eye-catching appearance.

The reason for a short equipment section is that
mundane                               items do not require excruciating detail —
the stock-in-trade of adventurers is mostly
weapons, magic, and armor. Accordingly, the rules
cover these items thoroughly. Normal treasure takes
many forms during an adventure, but players usually
convert loot into regular currency without fanfare.

Character Design

Eldritch RPG 2nd Edition uses a
flexible point-buy system for
character creation. The provided
class and race options offer a

balanced and fun experience
without                    the need to calculate exact
point costs. Players are encouraged

to prioritize their character's vision and play style
over                             point optimization. However, advanced players
can delve into detailed point-cost rules and
collaborate with the GM to create unique
combinations of class and fantasy races.

Chapter 2:
Action System


he Eldritch RPG describes proficiency
with                   the general term ability, with

several types and quantities of dice measuring
abilities                            in the game. Type refers to the number
of sides on a die. Quantity refers to the number
of dice rolled for a single action resolution
attempt. Abilities subsume all traits and skills.
The three basic abilities for characters in the
Eldritch game are Competence, Prowess, and
Fortitude. They cover what characters may
know, their ability to fight, and how they adapt
to the challenges of adventuring and the
unexpected. These core capacities form the basis
for almost all actions in the game.

Ability Trees and
Branches

Most actions use both a basic ability and
specialty                            (that is, any innate physical or mental
capacity and learned skill), possibly with a focus.
Some abilities directly impact combat statistics;
some do not. The importance of each depends on
the story and the nature of the campaign. The
ability structure can be compared to a tree, with

one branch comprising the basic ability (the
trunk) and its specialty (the branch).

Offshoots are the focus areas of
specialization.

The basic, specialty, and focus areas comprise the
whole tree with multiple branches.

The arrangement is reflected in Eldritch character
sheets                           (see Appendix). Full-fledged characters
measure the level of their traits and skills by die
rank.

Rank is expressed as the die value itself: d4
(average                           human; default basic rank), then d6, d8,
d10, and d12 (the highest rank for standard
characters). Focuses simply add a static bonus from

+1 to +5.

Branch Rank

The sum of the maximum values of the basic,
specialty,                               and focus areas of a branch of a character’s
ability tree gives his or her branch rank. This is a
useful overall indication of proficiency or power in
that branch.

Ability Branch Skill Levels

•Average: 4+

•Respectable: 6+

•Skilled: 12+

•Great: 18+

•Phenomenal: 24+

Ability Descriptions

In Eldritch, skills are divided into three basic
abilities,                           each of which has three specialties. Each

ACTION SYSTEM

•Wizardry: This Expertise focus represents a
tremendous                          amount of knowledge and training,
using magic to sense, control, change, or even create
the warp and weft of the fabric of reality. This


specialty has two focus areas. The basic, specialty,

and focus areas of a character’s ability tree are
described below.

Competence

This basic ability represents acumen and overall
potential,                        affecting shrewdness, reputation, natural
luck, and capacity for influencing others.

Adroitness. This Competence specialty measures
cleverness, quick-thinking, and even intuitive
movement (sensing traps). Those who are adroit are
good at jury-rigging and coming up with fast
solutions in tough situations.

•Skulduggery: This Adroitness focus grants a talent
for                            roguish activity, including deception and
trickery, providing a bonus to activities such as
stealth, deceit, disguise, bluffing, withholding
information, secrets. It also provides a bonus to lying
and sensing the lies of others.

•Cleverness: This Adroitness focus grants a
character                           greater intellectual acuity or innate
cunning, indicating a talent for resourcefulness and
ingenuity under pressure.

Expertise. This Competence specialty is the
measure                                of knowledge, especially what a character
has learned relevant to the role and occupation
assumed. Expertise assumes adeptness in a single
field by default, with proficiency in related
knowledge. This is usually most related to the chosen
class, but the player character’s concept may round
this out. Those with the Gift of Magic advantage may
make use of such knowledge without great danger to
themselves.

channels mages' innate gifts for manipulating
magic.                               An adept’s focus in Wizardry extends to
artificing, curses, potions, wards, and knowledge of
necessary material components.

•Theurgy: This Expertise focus is concerned with
the                                life force of living and growing things, and
invoking a supernatural spiritual source to restore,
revive, heal, vivify, or otherwise affect plants,
animals, people, or even monsters. Usually,
theurgists call upon their gods, and druids call upon
nature (or nature deities). But death is also part of
the cycle of life, and necromancers use this focus to
invoke evil powers and use negative energy to
animate the dead or inflict death, disease, and decay.
Perception. This Competence specialty covers
general acumen and the ability to notice, discern,
and react to things normally hidden.

•Alertness: This Perception focus provides a bonus
to                             things such as locating suspicious characters in a
crowd, or spotting a hidden mechanism for a trap
door, detecting hidden persons and things, or
observing stealthy creatures. A character with this
focus can better see or discover things others miss.

•Perspicacity: This Perception focus deals with
astuteness.                             A character with this focus is shrewd: he
has ready insight and good judgment in social
situations, and notices crucial details while
navigating dangerous environs.

34


Prowess

This basic ability covers all areas of ability in the
skills and capacities needed by adventurers to
survive.

Agility. This Prowess specialty measures more
than                             speed alone. It includes nimbleness, reflexes,
quickness of movement and action, hand/eye
coordination, and reaction time. It also ranks a
character’s celerity in close combat and his central
nervous system’s responsiveness, whether intuitive
or through training. Uses include jumping, balance,
running, tumbling, catching things, and dodging.

•Speed: This Agility focus covers the body’s natural
ability                             to move swiftly, a measure of celerity. Speed
affects the calculation of movement, especially while
running or sprinting.

•Reaction: This Agility focus confers a bonus to
responsive action, representing great reflexes and
rapidity in decision making amid danger. It is a
factor in determining battle phase.

Melee. This Prowess specialty covers engaging in
battle with hand-held weapons and unarmed
brawling. It includes the use of thrown weapons like
throwing axes, daggers, or spears. It also subsumes
the skill of fisticuffs and using improvised weapons.

•Threat: This Melee focus hones combat skills and
battle readiness. Characters train to take tactical
advantage of their foes' vulnerabilities.

•Finesse: This Melee focus deals with the art of
using                            lighter, versatile hand-to-hand weapons,
favoring grace over strength. Lighter, well-balanced
weapons (daggers, rapiers, light missiles) are often
swifter and allow for precise motion.

Precision. This Prowess specialty deals with the
use                                of weapons that discharge missiles, whether
bows, crossbows, or slings.

•Ranged Threat: This Precision focus hones the
threat posed by ranged combat skills. Characters
train to use missile weapons to take down their
enemies with deadly precision.

35

Ranged Finesse: This Precision focus improves
celerity                              and quick thinking in using ranged
weaponry, gaining the wielder an advantage in battle
initiative.

Fortitude

This basic ability encompasses all manner of
resisting                                and mitigating physical and mental harm.
Endurance. This Fortitude specialty measures the
capability to withstand physical hardship, fatigue,
and torment and measure the body’s natural
strength and toughness.

•Vitality: This Endurance focus is one of life force,
tuning                             in to the spark of instinct and the energy that
drives survival.

•Resilience: This Endurance focus increases
resistance                           against fatigue and is used in saving
throws against various afflictions, both magical and
mundane.

Strength. This Fortitude specialty includes things
like                          breaking items, lifting weights, performance
(bending bars), pushing, or resistance to various
hazardous conditions.

•Ferocity: This Strength focus imparts the ability to
channel aggression into effective action, not wild
rage; a controlled anger that sharpens the senses and
strengthens one to battle or to destroy obstacles.

•Might: This Strength focus imparts raw physical
power,                             the muscular force allowing one to bend bars,
throw open portcullis gates, or bust down doors.

Willpower. This Fortitude specialty measures
one’s                    self-control, bravery, and mental power.

• Courage: This Willpower focus helps one to
persevere                             in the face of fear, pain, or grief, and
withstand difficulty or danger. It can be used as a
bonus in a saving throw against magical afflictions
of fear or in situations when most mere mortals
would flee in terror.

•Resistance: This Willpower focus represents the
capacity                              to overcome mental and spiritual pressure,
exhaustion, and non-physical harm caused by mind-
affecting spells or certain magical traps.


Using Abilities

ACTION SYSTEM

Contest. A character shadowing someone in town
might                              use Prowess → Agility against the Competence


All ability tests are performed in essentially the same

way. The player chooses the ability and whatever
specialty                               is applicable, adds together the rolls for
each die in the ability branch, and totals the result,
sometimes modified by a focus area bonus or a
mastery die for class-specific feats. (If the task is not
covered by a specialty or focus area, only the basic
ability die applies.) The total is then used in various
ways depending on the task or situation.

Contest: Against an active opponent, e.g., in a
contest                                of skill, the test roll’s total is compared to an
opposed roll by the opponent, using an appropriate
ability branch. The higher result wins, with the
defender winning a tie.

Situation: When there is no active opponent, e.g., if a
character is trying to climb a wall, the GM decides on
a level of challenge and rolls the applicable challenge
die corresponding to the difficulty level. If the
player’s total is higher, the character succeeds.

Spells, Powers, and Feats: When using most spells,
innate                           magical powers, or special combat feats, the
total of the test is compared to the result of the
challenge die set for the action. If the player’s total is
equal or higher, the action takes effect (although its
success may depend on a following opposed roll).

Attacks: Attacking is resolved differently from other
actions in the game. There is no opposed roll.

Instead, when attacking an opponent with any
weapon                               or potentially damaging spell, the dice total
determines potential harm to the target or targets.
These threat points can be reduced or negated by
shield, armor, and the target’s active defense pool
before causing actual damage.

Attacks are dealt with in the Combat chapter, spells
in                               the Magic chapter, and feats in the Class Feats
section. Some examples of contested and situational
challenges follow.

→ Perception of the person being shadowed.

For instance Narr the rogue (Prowess d8→ Agility
d6)                               is following Geesler (a merchant and adept,
Competence d6 → Perception d6). Narr and Geesler
both roll a 7 total, which as it is a draw means that
Geesler’s beady eyes spot the tail.

Situation. Edmas the warrior is struggling through
the                              desert towards an oasis. It has been two days
since his horse died and he has no water. The GM
determines that pushing on is demanding because of
the heat, dehydration, and exhaustion, but Edmas is
driven by thirst and hope, so the challenge die will
only be difficult (a d8). The GM rolls an 8, but Edmas
(Fortitude d6 → Vitality d4) rolls a 9, so the character
makes it to the oasis and can slake his thirst.

Twisting Branches

A character is a metaphorical forest of knowledge
and                              skill. Certain circumstances, primarily feats,
allow for "twisted branches," where a focus or
specialty from a different branch is used. Twisted
branches are denoted with a "+" instead of "→" to
indicate crossover. While some feats may use two
focuses, only the higher focus contributes to the test
roll.

Improving Abilities

It costs character points equal to the maximum value
of                               the die rank to increase an ability or specialty one
step. All basic (1st tier) abilities default to a rank of
d4 if the character is untrained: this is the average
human ability, and costs nothing. Specialties require
training, so it costs 4 CPs to gain a d4 rank in one.

Increasing an ability or specialty from d4 to d6
costs                                6 CPs, and so on for each die rank, up to 12 CPs
for d12. Focuses also require training, and grant a
static bonus of +1 to +5 to an ability test or potential
harm roll, costing 4 CPs for each level. The
Cumulative Character Point Costs—Per die rank or

36


Focus Bonus table shows the cost per step increase in
die rank for basic abilities and specialties, or the cost
for an increase.

Defenses & Spirit Points

Defense pools are separate hit-point pools divided
into                              types of self-protective action or protection,
representing most ways the character can evade,
mitigate, or endure damage. They are ablative, that
is, they are lost in use. Spirit points work similarly,
but embody a character’s inner reserves and luck. All
derive from abilities.

Active Defense Pool

The active defense pool is calculated as the total
maximum                            values of Prowess + Agility + Melee dice. It
is the first line of defense against attack, and
measures how many threat points a character can
negate by choosing to evade, parry, or dodge. It is
rapidly depleted in combat (simulating fatigue) but
is just as rapidly refreshed once combat ends. See the
Combat chapter for more details.

Passive Defense Pool

The passive defense pool is calculated as the total
maximum values of Fortitude + Endurance +
Strength MV.

It is the last mode of defense against attack, and
measures how many threat points a character can
take in physical damage (including some degree of
mental and spiritual Resilience) before dying. It
recovers slowly. See the Combat chapter for more
details.

Spirit Points

Spirit points are calculated as the total maximum
values                               of Competence + Willpower (a specialization
of Fortitude) dice. They can be used to do
extraordinary things in the game: quickly recuperate
in mid-combat, fight inspiredly, energize spells or
magic items, enhance feats, activate certain feat

features, or cast spur-of-the-moment spells. If the
spirit                              points spent for an action exceed the number
available, the passive defense pool is reduced by the
excess. Spirit point use is described in more detail
where it applies, e.g., in the Combat and Magic
chapters.

Mastery Die

The Mastery Die is a special ability in Eldritch RPG
that                             grants characters an additional die to add to
specific rolls, reflecting their growing expertise. The
die's size and the number of daily uses increase with
the character's level.

For example, at level 1, a character can use a d4
Mastery                              Die twice per day, while at level 5, they can
use a d12 Mastery Die ten times per day. Players have
the freedom to use their daily allotment of Mastery
Dice strategically, expending them all at once or
spreading them out across multiple encounters.

Class Feats

Feats embody exceptional class-based abilities and
skills                              that extend beyond the standard rules. These
actions exemplify a character’s talent, strength,
willpower, faith, courage, knowledge, or puissance.
Every feat has an associated standard test, where
players roll dice to match or surpass the challenge
die roll result. The higher result prevails, with player
characters winning in case of a tie.

Each feat includes the test, the challenge, and a
description. Feats can be attempted once per round,
individually or in combination, unless stated
otherwise. A failed attempt results in no effect.

As part of the general usage rules for the Mastery
Die,                             players can choose to add their character's
Mastery Die to the dice rolled for a feat test. Each use
of the Mastery Die contributes to the daily limit of
uses and is allocated collectively for all Mastery Die
applications. The character's mastery die may be
added to the dice used twice per day per level.

Simple Feats

Feats are elaborated on in some depth but can be
dealt                               with quickly (in a pick-up game for instance)
by ignoring most of those rules, and just adding a
mastery die for certain tests or situations (once per
encounter per level for adding mastery). Use the feat
names as a broad guide, or even simpler, the areas
below.

Adept: Social interactions, general knowledge
Assassin: Setting ambushes, surprise attacks
Barbarian: Unarmed combat, feats of strength.
Mage:    Path spells (Thaumaturgy or Elementalism or
Sorcery),                           attack spells.

Mystic: Path spells (Mysticism), general intuition

Rogue: Stealthiness, surprise attacks.
Theurgist: Healing, path spells (Hieraticism).
Warrior: Melee, ranged combat.

Feat Challenge Types

Feats in Eldritch RPG are special abilities that
provide                         significant advantages in various scenarios.

Contested Feats pit the character against a basic
creature’s                              saving throw or an opponent’s ability
branch. Since basic opponents are more common,
feats first assume the use of creature saving throws.
Use the creature’s specific saving throw die if
available for basic opponents without detailed stats.
For detailed NPCs, refer to the ability branch
specified in the feat description.

Ranked Feats involve a test against a fixed or
variable                          Challenge Die. Situational Feats are tested
against a fixed Challenge Die, with success granting
bonuses or penalties. Threshold Feats require
meeting a prerequisite to bypass defenses.

Some class feats are grouped under broader
categories,                        indicating a specialization within the
class’s skillset. For example, the mage’s Arcane
Finesse is not a feat in and of itself but rather a
heading for several feats that improve spellcasting.

Feats are further divided into subtypes based on
their                           modality: Overlay Feats enhance or modify
attacks without requiring extra rolls, allowing for
combined effects with a single ability test or attack
roll, such as increasing damage or bypassing armor.
This means that the same roll determines both the
success of the feat and the potential harm or effect.
Full Action Feats may require a full action but offer
myriad benefits. Reaction Feats enable strategic
defensive or counter-actions, activated in response
to specific triggers, and do not consume the
character’s action during their battle phase. Each
feat belongs to one and only one subtype.

Players can attempt feats once per round.
Challenges                              range in difficulty from D4 (Easy) to D12
(Formidable), with harder challenges resulting in
greater consequences, especially for feats outside
one’s class. Players can use Inspiration or Panache to
avoid these consequences. Generally, a failed feat
results in no effect. The Revitalize Action allows
characters to regain spirit points and maintain their
active defense pool during battles.

Feat Duration and Maintenance: To determine if a
feat                              can be prolonged, consider its intent. If it
describes a single action or is a gateway to other
powers, it’s likely not maintainable. If it generates a
new condition or state that can be sustained over
time, it’s likely maintainable.

Maintainable feats have a default duration of 10
seconds                                 (1 round). If a character wants to maintain a
feat’s effect past the first round, they must
concentrate on prolonging the effect.

This imposes a penalty on other tests ranging from

-1 to -5 (corresponding to the feat’s challenge rank),
but                              not on attack rolls or threat points. Maintaining
multiple feats incurs cumulative penalties. For
magic-wielders, this stacks with spell maintenance
penalties.

39


ACTION SYSTEM


Trying feats from other classes

Characters may attempt feats from other classes if it
fits                               their concept. All feats require an ability branch
test with the specified specialization, but the focus
area isn't mandatory. When attempting out-of-class
feats, the mastery die can be used, but doesn't
benefit from the "master twist" mechanic. However,
feats requiring mandatory mastery die use (those
bypassing active defense, incapacitating, or
removing agency) cannot be attempted out-of-class.
GMs may rationalize these attempts as imitative or
studied, but not mastered, and determine their
difficulty. Failed attempts incur a -2 penalty on the
character's ability tests in their subsequent turn. See
"Combat Options" in Chapter 3 for details.

Smite,                    Supernatural Intervention

•Warrior: Battle Savvy, Maneuvers, Stunning
Reversal,                        Sunder Foe

Feats are categorized under broader headings like
Arcane                          Finesse. Each feat requires a dice roll to meet

or exceed a challenge die. Players may attempt one
feat                               per round. Challenge difficulty ranges from D4
(Easy) to D12 (Formidable), with harder challenges
carrying greater failure consequences.

Many feats allow for "Twisted Branches," combining
abilities,                      specialties, and foci from different
branches.

Some feats require Spirit Points (SP), listed in the
description after the feat's modality (full action,
overlay, or reaction). SP are only expended upon
successful activation, not on failure.

Refer to the following pages for specific subfeat
descriptions                              and their associated challenge levels.

Feats that bypass active defense points entirely
require                                the use of a mastery die for activation, as well
as spirit points. To activate such a feat, a player must
expend one of their available daily mastery die uses.
Negating a target’s defense in such a way is
impossible if no mastery-die slots remain.

Bypassing shields costs 3-5 spirit points depending
on                              the shield’s rank; bypassing armor costs 1–5
spirit points based on the armor’s die rank; and
bypassing active defense points requires 5 spirit
points. Keep in mind, you can only use Saving
Throws against effects that completely incapacitate
or deprive player characters of their agency, such as
mind control.

ACTION SYSTEM

Adept Feats


Guile

Test: Competence → Perception → Perspicacity.
Challenge                      (Situational): d4 to d12 (for +1 to +5 bonus
to persuade).

Description (Full Action): The adept can influence
almost                           anybody through their exceptional skill in
communication. Guile entails astute but sly, cunning,
and occasionally dishonest behavior in achieving a
goal by persuasion or trickery.

Adepts' expertise makes them most successful
negotiators.                          The more roguish work within black
markets as merchants of uncommon magical items.

Lore

Test: Competence → Perception → Perspicacity.
Challenge                      (Situational): GM determines challenge
die based on narrative (how the feat would influence

the flow of the story).

Description (Reaction): Adepts are typically sages
who                               are well-versed in the realm’s locations, people,
creatures, and metaphysical laws.

With a successful test, the adept can recall
pertinent                           information helpful to the current mission
or dilemma. They may have acquired such knowledge
as part of guild training or from tutors or sages, or
they may be self-taught, having had access to a
library or similar source of information.

Ritual Magic

Test: Competence → Expertise → Wizardry

Challenge (Varies): See the Arcanum section.
Description                           (Full Action): This feat grants
unmatched expertise in arcane rituals, crafting

magical items, and alchemy. All magic-wielders can

use the mastery die in ability tests for magical
artifice                              and alchemy, but only Adepts can do so
without suffering negative effects upon failure.
Adepts can also cast unlearned spells without spirit
point costs, rolling against the spell's default
challenge rank or using predetermined ranks from
scrolls or glyphs.

This feat also grants knowledge of the Permanency
Ritual,                          enabling magical items to be recharged
instead of becoming inert after their energy is
depleted. With the Permanency Transference ability,
Adepts can make an item's effect permanent for a
cost, though this can only be done once unless
renewed by another ritual. The feat further removes
maintenance penalties for non-instantaneous ritual
effects and offers a casting roll bonus of +2 for every
ten minutes of continuous ritual casting, capped at

+5.

42


Quick-witted

The adept character possesses intuitive savoir-faire;
the                            ability to do the right thing in a sticky situation
or act with polished surety socially. The adept’s
naturally acute problem-solving skills and deep
perception are usually improved through training as
well, granting them a most uncommon sense.

Improvisation

Test: Competence → Adroitness → Cleverness.
Challenge                    (Situational): GM determines challenge
die based on narrative.

Description (Full Action): The ability to find quick
and                           clever ways to overcome difficulties. Also
involves assembling something quickly, especially
for temporary use, or jury-rigging some solution
from whatever resources are at hand. This feat

confers a bonus to an ability commensurate with the
challenge.

Social Acumen

Test: Competence → Expertise → Perspicacity.
Challenge                    (Situational): GM determines challenge
die based on narrative and player’s description of

intent.

Description (Reaction): The ability to understand
and                              deal with any social situation or choice quickly
and accurately, and cultivate relationships with and
foster goodwill even among the most nefarious of
people. A successful test means that appropriate
behavior, cultural conduct, or body language and
tone is observed, granting a bonus to a contested
influence roll commensurate with the challenge (+1
through +5).

ACTION SYSTEM

Assassin Feats


Assassins excel at using preparatory skills (such as
Competence → Adroitness → Skulduggery) to gain
surprise. This advantage enhances their deadly feats,
typically resolved via a single Prowess-based ability
test.

Death Strike

Test: Either Prowess → Precision → Ranged Finesse

or Prowess → Melee → Threat.

Challenge (Fixed): d10. Cost: 1 Mastery Die.
Description                            (Full Action): The assassin strikes from
ambush, delivering a potentially deadly blow if

gaining full surprise over the target. On success, roll

the Prowess die a second time and add the result to
potential harm. This is particularly deadly in
conjunction with a iconic weapon + mastery die (up
to four dice may be rolled).

Stunning Affliction (2 Spirit Points). If the Death
Strike                              feat is successful, the player can choose to

spend 2 spirit points to apply a stunning effect. The
victim                              must roll a saving throw against the total
potential harm as the target number. For basic
creatures, use their standard saving throw unless the
creature description specifies otherwise. For full-
fledged NPCs, this is Fortitude → Endurance → Vitality
or Resilience. If the saving throw result is less than
the total potential harm, the target is stunned and
may neither move nor attack for one full round.

Lethal Exploit

Assassins train to find their target’s weak points,
whether                               it be a place left exposed by armor, or a
vulnerability in fighting style or social habits, and
exploit this through deadly skill with weapons or the
assiduous use of poison.

Bypass Armor

Test: Prowess → Melee → Finesse

Challenge (Variable): Difficulty equals die rank of
target’s armor (d4 to d12). Cost: 1 Mastery Die.

Description (Overlay): The assassin discerns the
most                           vulnerable spot in the target’s defense and
strikes with precision. The result of the Prowess →
Melee → Finesse roll is used to determine both the
potential harm and to test against the challenge die
set by the target’s armor. If the result meets or
exceeds the challenge, the armor does not reduce the
potential harm from the attack. Failure means the
armor protects normally. The feat requires
expending a mastery die to activate.

Poisoning

Test: Prowess + Expertise + Cleverness + Mastery.
Failing                         this means the attempt to poison fails.

Challenge (Threshold): The target’s active defense
must                           also be penetrated or bypassed.

44


Description (Full Action): The assassin prepares a
poison and applies it to a weapon, trap, or item to be
contacted or substance to be ingested. Failing the
test means the attempt to poison fails outright.

The target’s active defense must be penetrated to
passive defense with a standard attack if using a
poisoned weapon, or bypassed via a contested roll if
delivery is by contact or ingestion. A poisoned
creature must make a Fortitude → Endurance →
Vitality or Resilience save against a fixed die rank
from easy d4 to formidable d12 (indicating level of
lethality) or suffer the toxin’s full effect.

Poisoning Methods

The assassin may coat one slashing or piercing
weapon                             or missile with poison.

Applying the poison takes an action, and the poison
retains                             potency for 1 minute before drying. Assassins
have devious methods to deliver contact poison:
poisoning doorknobs, cabinet handles, the sword
hilts in an armory, the inside of a piece of clothing,
or the outside of a worn glove to deliver the poison
subtly.

A gas or powder to be inhaled is generally delivered
by                             some trapped mechanism. Poison in food or drink
requires access and planning, and perhaps gaining
the victim’s trust.

Types of Poison: There are many types of poisons,
and                             some are deadly on contact, others only when
ingested or inhaled. Some deliver extra harm, while
others allow a save to prevent deadly or
incapacitating afflictions. Strengths depend on the
dose, but range in potential harm from 1d4 through
to 3d20 or even instant death if failing several saves
consecutively.

Baneberry: The plant has poisonous berries colored
white,                            red, or purplish-black with clusters of small
white flowers. A small dose causes stomach cramps,
a burning throat, and nausea.

Batrachotoxin: With this poison, an amount the size
of                               two grains of table salt will kill you. It is taken
from the skins of diminutive frogs; preparers sweat
out the poison over a fire before applying it on their
darts. Blowpipes with poison darts are silent killing
tools.

Belladonna (Banewort): Ingestion of large amounts
of                             this plant may cause lethargy, coma, or death.

Hemlock: Beaver Poison. Conium maculatum. Fresh
juice                             (sap) can cause poisoning by ingestion or touch.
Finding safe ways of delivering such a poison takes
some ingenuity.

Nightshade: A narcotic that causes hallucinations,
fatal                                in large doses. A small dose causes loss of voice,
loss of movement in fingers and hands, and a nasty
back bending.

Ricin: Extracted from the seeds of the castor oil
plant,                              just a few grains of the powder can kill
someone when injected (in solution), swallowed, or
inhaled

Stavesacre: Also known as Lousewort. A type of
larkspur                             with poisonous leaves that have emetic and
cathartic properties that lead to respiratory failure,
bloat, and death.

45


ACTION SYSTEM


Ranged Ambush

Assassins are skilled with killing targets from afar
with                          incredible accuracy, shooting multiple targets
with great speed, or performing trick shots to pin or
disarm their quarry.

Vitality Shot

Test: Prowess → Precision → Ranged Finesse +
Mastery.

Challenge (Contested): For basic opponents (minor,
standard, exceptional) without detailed stats, use a
d12 challenge die or the specific saving throw die for
defense negation, if available and higher than d12.

For full-fledged NPCs with detailed stats, test the
roll                           against the target’s Prowess → Agility ability
branch. Cost: 5 SP.

Description (Overlay): The assassin carefully aims,
and                           discerning the target’s most vulnerable
moment, delivers a potentially deadly attack. Use the
test roll for both the feat and the potential harm as a
single action. Success means the target cannot use
active defense points. The threat points are reduced
by armor (but not a shield) before depleting passive
defense. Failure means only the normal attack
potential harm applies. The feat requires expending
a mastery die to activate.

Ranged Disarm

Test: Prowess → Precision → Ranged Finesse.
Challenge                      (Contested): Roll vs. target’s Prowess →
Agility.

Description (Full Action): Success means the
target’s                             weapon is knocked out of his hands and onto
the ground. It typically takes one full action to
retrieve and ready a dropped weapon.

Pin to Wall

Test: Prowess → Precision → Ranged Finesse +
Mastery.

Challenge (Contested): Prowess → Agility.
Description                           (Overlay; 5 SP): This feat pins a target to
a spot using a piercing arrow or bolt, usually by

aiming for clothing or armor near a wall. Targets lose

active defense points until they free themselves. For
basic                            creatures, escaping requires an opposed roll
using their standard saving throw against the
Assassin’s test roll. For full-fledged NPCs, it requires
an opposed roll of Prowess → Agility → Reaction.

Failing this, the target provokes an attack of
opportunity.                           The feat requires expending a mastery
die to activate

Ranged Rapid-Shot

Test: Prowess → Precision → Ranged Finesse.

Challenge (Fixed): d6

Description (Overlay): The assassin fires two shots
in                              the blink of an eye with the chance to slay two
foes. This feat allows a second, separate attack,
targeting a different foe using the same Prowess →
Precision → Ranged Finesse roll. If the feat test
succeeds, both attacks are resolved. If the feat test
fails, only one of the two targets gets hit, and the
second attack is an automatic miss.

Shadow Walk

Test: Prowess → Agility → Reaction.

Challenge (Fixed): d12. Cost: 1 Mastery Die.
Description                          (Full Action): In a world where magic
shades the real, the assassins' close links with the

shadow realm of death confer the esoteric power to

traverse shadows. This feat lets the assassin step into
and                               merge with any nearby shadow along with all
items normally worn and carried, move within the
shadow at normal speed, and jump to adjoining
shadows up to three feet away. It is otherwise
identical to the Shadow Walk spell (page 141).

46


Barbarian Feats


Berserk

The barbarian becomes furiously violent, attacking
with                          crazed battle lust.

Rage

Test: Prowess → Ferocity + Might.

Challenge (Variable): d4 (+1 threat points) to d12 (+5
threat points). Cost: 1 SP per +1.

Description (Overlay: The barbarian channels rage to
land a deadly blow. If successful, add the bonus
threat points to the attack roll. Use the test roll for
both the feat and the attack as a single action. Failure
means only the normal potential harm applies.

47

Thrash

Test: Prowess → Precision + Ferocity + Mastery.

Challenge (Fixed): d8

Description (Overlay; 5 SP): This feat bypasses the
target’s                             active defense points. Use a single ability test
roll to determine both the feat’s success and the
resultant potential harm. Success means the target
cannot use active defense points versus the
barbarian’s immediate attack. The threat points are
reduced by armor (but not a shield) before depleting
passive defense. Failure means only the normal
potential harm applies.

Trounce

Test: Prowess → Melee → Ferocity.

Challenge (Variable): Difficulty equals die rank of
target’s                              armor (d4 to d12). Cost: : 1-5 SP.
Description (Overlay) : Success means threat points

exceeding the opponent’s active defense bypass

armor (target gets no armor roll). Failure means
armor protects normally.

Brawl

The barbarian attacks bare-handed, relying on brute
force                                and aggression.

Crush

Test: Prowess → Melee + Ferocity.
Challenge: (Fixed): d6. Cost: SP 1-5 based on
Strength die rank.

Description (Overlay): The berserker may add to
their                              attack either an extra roll of the die rank of
Strength or +2 threat points, as preferred. If opting
for the Strength die roll, the SP cost is based on the
die rank: 1 SP for d4, 2 SP for d6, 3 SP for d8, 4 SP for
d10, and 5 SP for d12. Failure means only the normal
potential harm applies.


ACTION SYSTEM


Throw

Test: Prowess + Melee + Might.

Challenge: (Fixed): d6

Description (Overlay: SP 2): The opponent is grabbed
and                            thrown. Use the test roll to determine both the
feat’s success and the potential harm, adding a
damage bonus of +2. If the grabbed opponent is
thrown at another opponent or used to hit breakable
targets (table, door, etc.), damage is split evenly
between the target and what was struck.

Tackle

Test: Prowess → Agility + Ferocity.

Challenge (Contested): Opposed roll vs. target’s
standard                           saving throw (for basic creatures) or
Prowess → Agility → Reaction. Cost : 2 SP.

Description(Overlay): This feat combines a standard
attack                            with an attempt to knock the opponent prone
using the whole body. The maneuver costs 2 Spirit
Points and inflicts threat points normally from the
ability branch roll. An opponent who fails the
contested roll is knocked prone and must spend the
next round getting up.

Feat of Strength

Test: Prowess → Agility + Ferocity.

Challenge (Fixed)

Description (Full Action): This feat empowers the
barbarian to break down a door, bend metal bars, lift
a gate, bash open a chest, or break an object, such as
a weapon, or lock, with an incredible display of
focused energy. The rage-fueled force of a feat of
strength can be used to attack foes through
obstacles. GM assigns die rank for objects (see
Chapter 8), with an extra Opposed roll vs. target’s
Prowess → Agility → Reaction if the first roll was
successful for an attack through whatever the
barbarian broke

Grapple

Test: Prowess → Strength → Might.

Challenge (Fixed): d10

Description (Overlay): The barbarian grabs and
immobilizes                             the opponent with a wrestling hold such
as twisting an arm to lock the joint. Until the
opponent breaks the hold, they remain helpless. For
basic creatures, breaking the hold requires an
opposed roll using their standard saving throw
against the result of the successful test roll. For full-
fledged NPCs, it requires an opposed roll of Fortitude

→ Strength → Ferocity or Might. You can attempt this
once per round. If an attempt to break free fails, the
opponent suffers the potential harm of another roll
of the attacker’s Prowess die.

Mage Feats


Arcane Finesse

Arcane Finesse lets a mage, through his or her
superior                        understanding of magic, fine-tune spells so
that they can overcome a target’s defenses. The feat
alters a spell as it is cast, imparting a sort of ‘spin’ to
it, at a static penalty of +1 per level of the finessed
spell (+1 to +5).

Bypass Armor

Test: Competence → Expertise → Wizardry
Challenge                            (Ranked): The challenge die is the same as
the linked spell, ranging from d4 to d12. Cost: 1-5 SP

+ Mastery Die.

Description (Overlay): This feat lets the linked attack
spell                            bypass armor if its threat points exceed the
defender’s active defense. Use the test roll to
determine both the feat’s and the linked attack
spell’s success. The SP cost is based on the type of
armor being bypassed: 1 SP for light armor, 3 SP for

49

medium armor, and 5 SP for heavy armor. If the spell
already bypasses armor, this feat is not necessary.

Failure means armor protects normally.

Bypass Active Defense

Test: Competence → Expertise → Wizardry + Mastery
Challenge (Ranked): The challenge die is the same as
the linked spell, ranging from d4 to d12. Cost: 5 SP.

Description (Overlay): This feat allows the linked
spell                                to bypass the target’s active defense points. Use
the test roll to determine both the feat’s and linked
attack spell’s success. Success means the target
cannot use active defense points. The feat requires
expending a mastery die to activate.

Reduce Saving Throw

Test: Competence → Expertise → Wizardry
Challenge                          (Variable): 1 die rank per –1 static penalty
to target saving throw: d4 (–1 penalty) to d12 (–5

penalty). Cost: 1-5 SP + Mastery.

Description (Overlay): Linked mostly to Affliction
spells,                               this feat reduces the opponent’s saving throw
or opposed roll result. Use a single ability test roll to
determine both the feat’s success and the resultant
potential harm. Success means the target’s saving
throw is rolled with a penalty. The SP cost is based on
the penalty applied: 1 SP for a –1 penalty, 2 SP for a –
2 penalty, up to 5 SP for a –5 penalty.

Nullify Shield

Test: Competence → Expertise → Wizardry + Mastery.
Challenge (Variable): The challenge die starts at d4,
increasing by +1 per level of the linked spell (+1 to

+5), and +1 per static reduction to the shield bonus.

Cost: SP 3-5 based on shield’s reduction)
Description                       (Overlay: This feat allows the linked
spell to negate some or all of the target’s shield

damage reduction, including any magical bonuses or


ACTION SYSTEM


spells that act like or bolster shields. If the negation
reduction                            exceeds the shield’s protection, negative
numbers translate into extra threat points. Use a
single test roll to determine both the feat’s success
and the linked spell’s potential harm.

Absorb Arcane Threat

Test: Competence → Expertise → Wizardry
Challenge                          (Variable): Equal to a challenge die
determined by the attacker’s threat level (minor d6,

standard, d8, Exceptional d10, Legendary d12).

Cost: SP equal to incoming threat points, up to
available Spirit Points

Description (Reaction): This feat allows the caster to
absorb incoming arcane damage, converting it into a
temporary increase in active defense points. The
caster can spend Spirit Points up to their available
amount to absorb and convert threat points. The
absorbed points are immediately added to the
caster’s active defense points

Dweomers

Dweomers are incantations and gestures that
amplify                                the effect of other spells. They must be
readied beforehand, linked to a chosen spell. This
means the mage must declare the use of a dweomer
before casting the linked spell during their battle
phase. Each dweomer has a maintenance penalty of
–1. The linked spell has its own maintenance
penalty, so if the linked spell isn’t maintained,
neither is the dweomer. Dweomers also usually add a
static penalty of +1 per level of the augmented spell
(+1 to +5).

Increase Harm

Test: Competence → Expertise + Ferocity.

Challenge (Ranked): The challenge die is the same as
the linked spell, ranging from d4 to d12
Maintenance: –1 . Cost: 1-5 SP.

Description (Overlay) Maintenance: -1: Increases
the                               harm effect of the linked spell, bolstering threat
points against the target. Use a single test roll to
determine both the dweomer and the attack spell’s
success. The spirit point cost is based on the potency
increase: 1 SP for a +1 increase, 2 SP for a +2 increase,

3 SP for a +3 increase, 4 SP for a +4 increase, and 5 SP
for a +5 increase. This can stack with other enhanced
harm threat point spells. Failure means only the
normal potential harm applies.

Make Area Effect

Test: Competence → Expertise → Wizardry.
Challenge                         (Variable): d12 for a 1st level mage down
to d4 for a 5th level mage. Cost: 1 SP per round.

Description (Overlay, –1 maint.): The spell’s effect is
transformed into an area effect. The radius equals
the ability branch maximum of the linked spell’s
ability branch. Failure means only the normal
potential effect applies.

Revivifying Transference

Test: Competence → Expertise + Cleverness.
Challenge                         (Variable): Versus challenge of the linked
spell; d4 through d12.

Description (Full Action, -1 maint): This dweomer
lets                               the mage reduce the difficulty of the linked spell
by a maximum of one step down per level. Each use
simultaneously replenishes spirit points up to and
even exceeding the maximum score. Excess spirit
points immediately drop off once the dweomer’s
effect ends. Failure means the dweomer does not
take effect, so any disadvantage remains.

50


Prevent Failure Effects

Test: Competence → Expertise → Wizardry +
Mastery.

Challenge (Variable): The challenge die is the same
as                             the linked spell, ranging from d4 to d12.

Description (Full Action: Maintenance: -1): This
dweomer                             prevents spell failure effects of the linked
spell while the feat is maintained, even for spells of
higher level. Failure means that if the spell fails to
activate, there is a consequence to failure as per the
Spell Failure Table. Note that this dweomer does not
affect path spells, as path spells do not have failure
effects.

Intangible Threat

Test: Competence → Expertise → Wizardry.
Challenge                         (Variable): The challenge die is the same
as the linked spell, ranging from d4 to d12.

Description (Overlay; 4-17 SP): This dweomer
converts                             the threat points from the linked attack
spell into non-physical damage, bypassing shields,
armor, and certain physical defenses like sword
parries. However, the spell maintains its visual and
auditory effects, enabling the application of dodges
and active defense points. Magical protections
against preternatural attacks still work.

Active defense in this case depends on the ability to
move out of the way of the spell’s manifested form,
as it cannot be parried or blocked physically. An
Intangible Threat attack first drains threat points
from active defense, then passive defense
(Fortitude). Spirit Point Costs: Bypassing Armor: d4 =
1 SP, d6 = 6 SP, d8 = 8 SP, d10 = 10 SP, d12 = 12 SP.

Bypassing Shields: Add 3 SP for -1 shield (d8), 4 SP
for                                -2 shield (d10), and 5 SP for -3 shield (d12). Note:
If the linked spell already includes defense negation,
don’t apply the cost twice. Example Calculation: For a
linked attack spell with a challenge die of d6, the
calculation is: Bypassing armor: 6 SP (1 SP x 6). Total
Cost: 6 SP.

Clandestine Casting

Test: Competence → Expertise → Wizardry.
Challenge                         (Variable): The challenge die is the same
as the linked spell, ranging from d4 to d12.

Description (Overlay; 4-7 SP): This feat lets the
mage                                cast a spell with various grades of
undetectability. The four options are casting without
words (1 SP), casting without gestures (1 SP), casting
without audible effects (2 SP), and casting without
visible effects (3 SP). Casting without words or
gestures is useful if bound, gagged, or attempting
surprise. One cannot dodge a spell with no audible
and visible effects, but targets can still apply other
forms of active defense. If the linked spell already
includes an effect that negates the target’s ability to
perceive the attack visually, adjust the spirit point
cost accordingly to avoid duplication. For instance,
casting a linked attack spell with a challenge die of
d6 without words and visible effects results in a total
cost of 4 SP (1 SP for casting without words and 3 SP
for casting without visible effects). Total Cost: 4 SP.

Wizardry Path Mastery

A mage can learn any spell but must specialize in one
path—Thaumaturgy, Elementalism, or Sorcery.

Specializing eliminates the risk of negative effects
from                             spell failure when casting spells within their
chosen path. Also, using a mastery die with a chosen
path spell allows a re-roll if it lands on a 1, adding
the new result to the total.

Mystic feats


Iron Mind

Test: Fortitude → Willpower + Vitality.

Challenge (Fixed): d6. Cost: 1 SP per round.
Description                              (Full Action): This feat blocks any power
that lets another creature read the mystic’s mind or

pry into thoughts (or memories) so long as it is

maintained. Those attempting to read the mind of
one                               so shielded know they are being blocked by
magic. Iron Mind can only be maintained while the
mystic’s spirit points are above zero.

Premonition

This feat gives the mystic a range of presentiments
about                           and mystical insights into situations and
encounters.

Insight

Test: Fortitude → Willpower + Vitality.

Challenge (Fixed): d4

Description (Full Action): Once per day per level, the
mystic gains some hint about impending danger or
the risks associated with current plans or intended
actions. The premonition comes in symbolic
imagery, or sometimes interpretable visions, at the
GM’s discretion. It cannot extend beyond the action,
plan, or intention imagined. Premonitions do not
show outcomes but give an idea of the level of danger
or range of possibilities.

Sense Threat

Test: Fortitude → Willpower + Vitality.

Challenge (Fixed): d4

Description (Reaction): Once per day per level, this
feat                            grants the mystic insight into the target
creature’s level of threat. The GM may tell the player
whether the target creature is a minor, standard,
exceptional, or legendary threat.

Sixth Sense

Test: Fortitude → Willpower + Vitality.

Challenge (Fixed): d6

Description: Three times per day per level, this feat
gives                               the mystic the ability to sense danger and
direction in unfamiliar situations or environments. It
grants the mystic a +2 on all rolls in response to
perceived danger or avoiding simple or total surprise.

53


ACTION SYSTEM


Super Intuition

Test: Fortitude → Willpower + Vitality.

Challenge (Fixed): d8. Cost: 1 SP per use + Mastery.
Description (Reaction: 2/day per level): Twice per
day per level, this feat grants the mystic an intuitive

awareness in dangerous or challenging situations. A

non-visual form of premonition, like a tingling
sensation                            or general feeling of warning, increases
the caster’s Perception base die rank by 3 ranks. If
the Perception rank is already d12, increase rolls by

+6.

Psychic Powers

This feat lets the mystic employ supernormal
perceptions.

Mind Read

Test: Competence → Expertise → Wizardry.
Challenge                         (Contested): Target uses Fortitude →
Willpower + Resistance. Cost: 1 SP per use + Mastery.

Description (Full Action: 1/day per level): Once per
day                               per level, the mystic can pick up the surface
thoughts of a target for a round per level. The mystic
also gains insight into the target’s emotional state,
which is an effective way to sense deception. The
Mastery Die is required when you first latch into a
mind—think of it as focusing your mystical channel
attempt at discerning thought and emotion, which
needs another contested roll (effectively a saving
throw).

Oneiric Conduit

Test: Fortitude → Willpower + Vitality

Challenge (Fixed): d8

Description: This feat connects the Mystic’s mastery
of                                the Mysticism path with dream magic, known as
Oneiromancy. Upon activation, the Mystic can use
Oneiric Conduit once per day for each level they
possess. When used independently, Oneiric Conduit
allows the Mystic to enter a sleeping target’s dreams,
providing the ability to communicate, gather

information, or subtly influence the target’s
subconscious.                              As an Overlay with Dreamwalk, it
enhances the spell by not requiring additional Spirit
Points and doubles the effective range. It also allows
the Mystic to bypass physical barriers like walls or
doors when connecting with a target’s dreams. This
feat cannot be used on preternatural or supernatural
creatures.

See Aura

Test: Competence → Perception → Perspicacity.
Challenge                (Contested): target uses Fortitude →
Willpower.

Description (Full Action: 1/day per level): Once per
day                                per level, this feat lets the mystic see the psychic
aura of a creature or object. It shows the general
state of health of a creature, such as whether it is
sick, weary, or wounded. On a roll of 10 or better, the
mystic can determine the type of being, e.g. human,
dwarf, or elf, from aura alone. For an object it shows
magic (energy fields), and on a roll of 20 or better
can distinguish the type of magic present.

Mystic Path Mastery

The Mystic Path mastery feat ensures that failed
spells                              from the Mysticism specialty path simply
fizzle out with no negative effects. Additionally,
when using a mastery die with a spell from this path,
the mage can re-roll the die if it lands on a 1, adding
the new result to the total.

54


Rogue Feats


Backstab

Test: Prowess → Melee + Speed

Challenge (Threshold): Must achieve surprise versus
the                           target’s Competence → Perception.

Description (Overlay): A backstab is possible
whenever                                 a rogue gains surprise, often using the
Stealth feat. If the target is surprised, the rogue rolls
an additional Prowess die when making the first
attack in the round, with the result added as
additional threat points to the total potential harm in
a single strike.

This move becomes even more lethal when the
rogue                            wields an iconic weapon, which not only
grants a focus bonus to potential harm but also
allows for an additional mastery die roll (a master
twist) if the initial roll hits its minimum value,
further amplifying the rogue’s damage output.

Evasion

This feat lets the rogue avoid situational hazards or
attacks.

Elude Hazard

Test: Prowess → Adroitness + Cleverness (or +
Alertness).

Challenge: (Situational): GM determines challenge
die                             or dice.

Description: This feat lets the rogue dodge out of the
way of a hazard, avoiding all potential harm. The GM
decides the level of danger and rolls the applicable
die. If the player’s total is higher, the character
successfully evades the trap or peril. This feat may be
used once per hazardous situation at 1st level, up to 5
times per situation (but only once per round) at level
5.

Dodge

Test: Prowess → Agility → Reaction + Mastery.
Challenge                       (Variable): d12 for a 1st level rogue down
to d4 for a 5th level rogue.

Description (Reaction: 4 SP); : This feat lets the
rogue                              dodge out of the way of a melee or missile
attack, avoiding all potential harm. It cannot be used
to evade spells. This feat may be used once per
encounter at 1st level, up to 5 times per encounter
(but only once per round) at level 5. The feat requires
expending a mastery die to activate.

55


ACTION SYSTEM


Roguish Charm

Test: Competence → Adroitness → Skulduggery

Challenge (d8)

Description (Full Action): Rogues are known to have
almost preternatural charm, some no doubt through
guild training. This feat lets the rogue befriend
someone or persuade them to do something if
succeeding in a roll to charm. If the charming would
have the target do something undesirable or out of
character, the one affected gets a contested roll
(effectively a saving throw) of Fortitude → Willpower
against the rogue’s test result.

Stealth

Test: Competence → Adroitness → Skulduggery
Challenge                (Contested): versus the target’s
Competence → Perception.

Description (Reaction): This feat grants the
rogue                        greater skill in moving silently or hiding
while remaining stationary. The test opposes
any observing creature’s Competence →
Perception, or their saving throw stat if they
are basic creatures. As with all feats, the
rogue’s mastery die can be added to this test.

Successfully using this feat provides a +2
bonus                          on the subsequent Backstab attack
roll, reflecting the rogue’s superior
preparation and positioning. Using the
Stealth feat outside of combat offers strategic
benefits like evading detection, gathering
intelligence, or setting up an ambush.

One Ability test, Multiple Target Numbers

In Eldritch RPG, most actions—from casting spells
to                          executing feats—are determined by a single
ability test roll or a roll versus a challenge die or
opposing ability test. The game is designed so that
a single roll of the player's dice pool can be
checked against multiple target numbers, such as
both a challenge die and an opposing ability test.

56


Theurgist Feats


Divine Healing

Theurgists call on higher powers to provide healing.
The                              gods grant their priests restoration magic to heal
the faithful, while druids channel the divine energies
of the natural world.

Bolstering spells imbue the recipient with life force
in                               some way, eliminating fatigue or providing energy
and stamina. An unconscious creature can stand up
and resume activity in the same round that magical
healing occurs. Restoring spells heal, effectively
treating injuries, curing disease, or countering the
effects of poison.

The active defense pool replenishes fully after a
brief                               rest; therefore, healing spells used during
combat are most useful in extended battles. Restored
hit points cannot exceed the target’s maximum
score.

Bolster or Mend

Test: Competence → Expertise + Vitality

Challenge: d4 (active) or d6 (passive). Cost: 1 SP.
Description                           (Full Action): Active or passive hit points
are replenished by the amount rolled. Failure means

the healing magic fails.

Cure Debility

Test: Competence → Expertise + Vitality

Challenge: Special. Cost: equals die-rank MV.
Description                            (Full Action): Some magical powers can
cause a reduction in a victim’s targeted ability die

rank. Usually, this is a temporary reduction.

The theurgist can spend spirit points to restore any
temporarily lost die ranks of the recipient’s abilities
(at a spirit point cost equal to the die rank MVs). The
recipient must be willing to receive the cure. If the
reduction was permanent, such as with the most
horrendous of afflictions, then failing a divine
intervention, the cost is expended in actual character
points rather than spirit points.

Heal

Test: Competence → Expertise + Vitality / Resilience

Challenge (Fixed): d12. Cost: 12 SP.

Description (Full Action): The recipient’s active and
passive defense points are bolstered and mended by
the roll of the tested ability branch. This subfeat adds
both focuses to the restored hit points, but only the
higher of the two counts toward the actual ability test
roll.

57


ACTION SYSTEM


Negate Affliction

Test: Competence → Expertise + Resistance

Challenge: Special.

Description (Full Action; SP 4-12): The challenge die
is                               the Strength of the poison, disease, or condition to
cure (specified in the trap, ward, hex, or cursed
magic item description). Removes the Affliction or
poison effect immediately.

Regenerate

Test: Competence → Expertise + Resilience

Challenge (Fixed): d12. Cost: 12 SP.

Description (Full Action. Maint: -5): This feat
regenerates                             active and passive defense points by a
number matching the roll of the tested ability
branch.

In addition, regeneration allows the regrowth of a
bodily part after injury, accelerating the normal
healing process to a supernatural level. Limbs
regrow and return to full functionality in d4 hours.
Like Heal, this subfeat adds both focuses to the
regeneration, but only the higher of the two counts
toward the actual ability test roll.

Rejuvenate or Heal

Test: Competence → Expertise + Resilience
Challenge                         (Fixed): d8 (restore active) or d10 (heal
passive). Cost: 8-10 SP.

Description (Full Action): Active or passive hit
points                             are replenished by MV of the tested ability
branch. Failure means the healing still occurs, but
costs spirit points equal to half the amount healed,
rounded up.

Spiritual Revitalization

Test: Competence → Expertise + Vitality

Challenge (Fixed): d6 (random restoration points) or
d8 (fixed MV restoration points).

Description (Full Action; 6-8 SP): This feat restores
spirit                           points to the recipient either by the amount
rolled or by the MV of the ability branch.

Spiritual Smite

Test: Prowess → Melee or Precision + Theurgy
Challenge                         (Variable): d8 (+3 threat) to d12 (+5
threat). Cost: 8-12 SP; +2 SP per additional +1 threat.

Description (Overlay): The theurgist calls upon a
higher                             power to channel damaging energy into any
physical attack. Visible spiritual energy (in some way
characteristic of the source) augments the weapon
used, even if it is only a fist.

The increase to potential harm is +3 to +5, but can
be                           increased with spirit points at the cost of 2 points
per +1, up to a maximum of +10 threat points. The
theurgist can opt to merely knock a creature
unconscious this way, no matter the number of
threat points delivered.

Theurgy Path Mastery

A theurgist can learn any spell but must specialize in
either Druidry or Hieraticism. Path spells that fail
simply fizzle out with no adverse effects. Druids treat
Nature as a divinity for spellcasting and feats.

When using a mastery die with a chosen path spell,
the                          theurgist can re-roll the die if it lands on a 1,
adding the new result to the total.

58


Supernatural Intervention

Test: Competence → Expertise → Theurgy + Mastery

Challenge (Fixed): 2d12. Cost: Varies.

Description (Full Action): The theurgist prays to a
higher power for direct intervention at a time of
great need. Such prayers often get what the deity
decides is needed rather than what is asked for. (The
GM has complete control over this petitionary feat,
but should neither let the gods be imposed upon nor
unduly punish players for misguided requests.) The
feat requires expending a mastery die to activate.

Possible effects include:

• Avatar (Legendary, 12 SP): A representation of the
deity                             itself materializes and either intimidates,
persuades, or attacks the enemy. This is rare because
if one god intervenes so directly, others may notice
and feel the balance of power is threatened.
Suddenly, the situation explodes into mayhem as
avatars arrive and do battle, sometimes destroying
vast areas; the event becomes something few
mortals can survive.

• Banishment (Uncommon, 6 SP): One key creature
or                               NPC is swept out of the scene by divine power,
translocated to some other place nearby, or even
yanked through dimensions to face the deity’s ire. As
with avatar visitations, this can draw attention from
other powerful entities, especially if the one
banished was part of another deity’s grand scheme.

• Activate (Esoteric, 8 SP): The deity grants
temporary                          teleportation powers for either the
individual or group, or immunities to certain types of
damage or hazards, or the ability to travel quickly
and freely through dangerous or difficult terrain, for
a number of hours depending on level; 4 hours at 1st
level, 6 hours at 2nd level, 8 hours at 3rd level, 10
hours at 2nd level, and 12 hours at 5th level.

• Favor: The theurgist and any present allies gain a
favor                                of choice, for the day or for an encounter. Day:
The Fortunate advantage (q.v.) is granted for the day.
Those already possessing the advantage re-roll
failed ability tests on a result of 1 or 2 rather than a 1.
Encounter: Every feat and spell automatically
succeeds for the entire encounter, but each instance
drains 2 spirit points from the one succeeding.

• Resurrection: Resurrection is a powerful
intervention                                 to request, requires expendature of a
Mastery Die, and costs the theurgist 2d12 spirit
points even if unsuccessful. It is rarely repeated since
failure might be a divine rejection. If the petition
were for one who was unfaithful or opposed to the
deity called upon, it could result in a cursed
reanimation of the body as a zombie or similar
undead with unfortunate consequences.

• Spell-like power (Varies): the petitioner may be
granted                          temporary use of a power mirroring any
spell in the game. The theurgist can immediately
comprehend the formula and cast it without a
penalty or a challenge roll. For this sub-effect, the SP
cost is determined by matching the rarity of the
specific spell being replicated. If the spell is
Common, it would cost 4 SP; if Uncommon, 6 SP; if
Esoteric, 8 SP; and if Legendary, 12 SP.

• Summoning: The theurgist is granted the power to
visualize and summon a creature (corporeal or
incorporeal, sentient or not) applicable to the
situation at hand. The creature materializes and does
the theurgist’s bidding for an encounter, or even
longer if he can maintain the feat by expending 1d12
spirit points per hour (q.v. Summon Monster spell).
For summoning maintenance, charge the same SP/
hour as the wall-to-spell-rank above (e.g., an
Esoteric summon → 8 SP/hour).

59


Warrior Feats


Battle Savvy

Warriors train to find their target’s weak points and
use                            weapons with lethal skill.

Bypass Armor

Test: Prowess → Melee +Ferocity + Mastery
Challenge                       (Variable): Difficulty equals die rank of
target’s armor (d4 to d12). Cost: 1-5 SP.

Description (Overlay): The warrior can discern the
most                         vulnerable spot in the target’s defense and
strikes with terrifying fierceness. On success, armor
does not reduce potential harm from the subsequent
attack. Failure means armor protects normally.

Focused Strike

Test: Prowess → Melee + Might

Challenge (Variable): d4 (+1 threat) to d12 (+5
threat). Cost: 1-5 SP.

Description (Overlay): In this feat, the warrior winds
up                                to deliver a crushing attack. Roll the test against
the selected challenge die, and add the bonus to the
attack. Add the bonus of +1 to +5 to threat points to
the attack roll (1 SP per increase).

Maneuvers

Warriors are not averse to using tricks to gain an
advantage in combat.

Disarm

Test: Prowess → Melee + Finesse

Challenge (Contested): Opposed roll vs. target’s
Prowess → Melee or Agility (defender chooses)
Description (Full Action): Success means the target’s

weapon is knocked out of his hands and onto the

ground. It typically takes one full action to retrieve
and                             ready a dropped weapon. Failure means that the
warrior cannot use the feat again on the next round.

Feint

Test: Prowess → Melee + Reaction

Challenge (Fixed): d6.

Description (Reaction): The warrior appears to
attack                              from one direction but shifts to another at the
last second. Success grants +1 threat points and
bypasses non-magical shields of up to -2 rating
(medium shield).

60


Leg Sweep

Test: Prowess → Melee + Cleverness

Threat

Challenge (Fixed): d6

Description (Overlay): A minimum damage kick that
causes the defender to fall prone. Only basic tier,
Prowess-based damage is delivered. If the defender
fails a roll of Prowess → Agility roll vs. the attack to
remain standing, he falls and must spend the next
round getting up.

Multiple Attacks

Test: Prowess → Melee + Reaction

Challenge: Special; once per encounter per level,
splitting                          attack dice pools up to five times during an
encounter, up to once per battle round.

Description (Overlay): Multiple attacks can be
performed                             with any one-handed weapon. The ability
branch dice are split into multiple strikes against a
single foe or against different targets within reach.

Each die rolled delivers a separate attack, each with
the                            threat focus harm bonus added (close or ranged).
All attacks are resolved in the actor’s turn.

Trip

Test: Prowess → Melee +Cleverness

Challenge (Fixed): d6

Description (Overlay): The warrior trips an opponent
with                                a weapon, making him stumble. Does no
damage, but the target staggers and has initiative
reduced by one battle phase. Failure means that the
warrior cannot use the feat again on the next round.

Stunning Reversal

Test: Prowess → Melee + Vitality

Challenge: d10. Cost: 1 Mastery Die.

Description (Full Action): The warrior can, as a free
action, apply a +3 threat points to augment any
single attack while simultaneously restoring his
active defense points pool by the Max Value of his
Prowess → Melee ability branch.

Sunder Foe

Test: Prowess → Melee + Might

Challenge (Fixed): d8. Cost: 3 SP (Mastery optional).
Description                            (Overlay): Success against the Challenge
adds +3 threat points. Expending 1 Mastery Die

before the test optionally enhances a successful

strike. The enhancement bypasses armor (d8 or
lower) and may sunder non-magical shields/
weapons (excluding steel/iron/magic; target gets
Skillful/basic save to resist sunder).

A minimum Mastery Die roll triggers a Master
Twist: reroll the Mastery Die, add result to threat and
test total. MD enhancement use is limited (Level/
day).                                  If uses are expended, spend SP=MD rank
instead of MD for enhancement effects (this SP cost
is additional to the base 3 SP). Using only the base 3
SP grants +3 threat on success but no sunder/bypass.

Chapter 3:
Combat


ike many fantasy role-playing games,
the                 Eldritch Role-playing System

assumes a substantial part of gameplay will
focus                             on heroic battle. This does not preclude
the GM from generating adventures that feature
great interaction with less violent plots. Rather,
these rules focus on combat because it is
traditionally the most difficult aspect for GMs to
arbitrate with consistent fairness.

Even so, this combat system is abstract rather
than                           a “simulation,” the emergent story being
the focus of play and the mechanics existing
only to further action in the story.

Whenever battle commences, it is up to each
defender                              to describe how he parries, dodges and
evades, deflects, or otherwise absorbs the
damage of an opponent’s attack.

A single roll of the dice determines the success
of                            an attack and resultant damage. The
defender’s active and passive defense pool
reduces this, as do armor and shields.

Critical Rule! Active defense points are fully
refreshed after escaping or ending combat.
Generally, a minute to catch one’s breath is
enough.

Avoiding Harm

There are three ways to mitigate the Potential Harm:
active                          defense points, shield or armor-based damage
reduction, and lastly, a character’s passive defense
points.

This is simplified to a single hit point score for
most                        GM-controlled opponents, sometimes adding a
roll to determine armor effectiveness.

Defense Hit Points

Active defense refers to using the defense hit point
pool                           based on Prowess, which covers parries,
blocking, dodging, and evading attacks, or the
damage reduction of shields (which are used
actively).

Passive defense refers to using the passive pool of
hit                            points, based on Fortitude, representing overall
toughness against physical and mental attack,
resilience against fatigue, endurance, physical
health, and so on, or the damage reduction of armor
(which is used passively).

Damage reduction reduce threat points by either a
fixed amount based on shield type (e.g., –1 damage)
or by a random roll based on armor type (e.g., -d6
damage). Magic may work either way.

Combat Rounds

The following is a full breakdown of combat: rounds

COMBAT

Initiative

Prowess determines a creature's base turn order in a


and movement, attacking, defending, and armor. We
will begin with combat rounds and battle phases.

The system divides combat into rounds. Battle
phases                               help keep track of actions within the round.
Each combat round has five 2-second battle phases
(1 to 5) and lasts about 10 seconds. Creatures
typically perform their actions in descending order
of Prowess rank, ranging from d12 (fastest) down to
d4 (average Prowess). Each battle phase corresponds
to when combatants of a particular Prowess rank
take their intended actions.

Battle Phases

Creatures with Prowess ranks higher than d12 take
their                            actions before all others. Creatures with a
Prowess lower than d4 move last in the round.

An action could be attacking, casting a spell,
activating                            a magic item, or using a special ability.
Actions may be complex but usually take only one
battle phase to perform.

Battle Phase Table

Prowess rank Battle phase  Initiative

range

d12        1          12+

d10        2         9-11

d8         3         7-8

d6         4         5-6

d4         5         1-4

Do not assume action occurs broken into lockstep
phases                            as if creatures were politely taking turns to
attack and defend. Rather, envision a chaotic
situation of frantic action!

Once all creatures have taken their actions, a new
round                            begins. The first action is taken by the creature
or character with the highest Prowess: the Max Value
of basic Prowess, plus any adjustments based on the
Agility-based Reaction focus.

combat round, but specific focus bonuses like the
static Reaction and Finesse can enhance it.

Agility does not directly affect battle phase order but
increases movement speed, providing a strategic
advantage. A high Agility score boosts the active
defense pool, increasing the number of attacks a
character can potentially dodge, thus extending their
survival time. Random Initiative using Prowess,
Agility, and Reaction is a general rule for breaking
ties in initiative when neither initiative modifiers
nor weapon reach or range offer a clear advantage.

Battle Phase Modifiers

Reaction

The Agility-based Reaction focus modifies initiative,
adding                            its value to the Prowess Score maximum
value to help determine the battle phase.

Finesse

The Finesse or Ranged Finesse focus bonus adds to a
combatant’s initiative when specialized in Melee or
Precision respectively and using Finesse weapons
(see GM's section on Attack Styles). Initiative-
related magic spells can also modify initiative.

Magical Modifiers to Initiative

Certain magic can change a creature's initiative (see
Battle                               Phase Table). Initiative bonus spells are
powerful. A low Prowess (d4) adept usually acts late,
but a +1 bonus can push them into the earlier d6
phase (5-6). This shows how magic can shift combat
dynamics by improving initiative without changing
base ranks in Prowess, Agility, or Melee
specialization.

64


Turn Order in a Battle Phase

There are two considerations when determining who
goes first if several opponents are acting in the same
battle phase: Attack Precedence and Heroic Action
Order.

Attack Precedence

The weapons table in the GM's section or Weapons
Listing                                of this book provides information on the
range or reach of each weapon, which can help
players determine their relative effectiveness for
initiative purposes.

Range refers to the distance a missile weapon can
travel                             before losing accuracy or effectiveness, while
reach is the distance from within which a melee
weapon can be used effectively in close combat.

Generally, weapons with longer range or reach tend
to                               be more effective for initiative than those with
shorter range or reach.

However, the actual effectiveness of a weapon may
vary depending on the situation and other factors.

While the rules provide guidance on the general
order                              of effectiveness, it should be treated as a rule
of thumb rather than a strict ordering.

In combat, a long-range missile weapon such as a
bow typically has a higher priority than a short-
range weapon like a dagger, providing the wielder
with an initiative advantage. Similarly, a melee
weapon with long reach, such as a polearm, will
usually have higher priority than a dagger, granting
it an initiative advantage as well. Thus, in combat, a
bow tends to outperform a dagger.

Heroic Action Order

If the opponents in the same battle phase (1 through
5)                              have weapons of equal range or reach, then refer
to the heroic action order rule to decide the sequence
of action.

Player-adventurers (PAs), legendary NPCs, and
legendary                          creatures act first or nearly
simultaneously in the same battle phase. See Intra-
Battle Phase Initiative. The GM may consider
precedence for certain weapons or fighting styles if it
would grant an obvious advantage. Otherwise, a
random initiative roll is used (see below).

•PAs act first when facing inferior foes (minor,
standard,                           and exceptional level) in the same battle
phase, assuming equal reach or range.

•Exceptional creatures act second in the same battle
phase.

•Standard creatures act third in the same battle
phase.

•Minor creatures act fourth in the same battle phase.

Characters are assumed to be heroes and therefore
superior.                      Exceptional creatures act next in the battle
phase, then standard creatures, and lastly, the lowly
minor creatures (see page 205).

However, when legendary NPCs and monsters act
in                              the same battle phase as player characters, the
initiative for that turn may be determined by using
rolling random initiative within the same battle
phase, the highest result acting first, modified by
focus bonuses or other factors.

Game Master Note: Initiative is simplified for most
monsters since they do not have full-fledged ability
listings. Their stat blocks (creature descriptions and
statistics) determine initiative and movement.

65


COMBAT

66


Random Initiative

Legendary NPCs and monsters are elevated in
narrative                            status to the same level as player
characters. Sometimes they act in the same battle
phase as player characters. In this case, if initiative
modifiers are not a clear determiner and reach or
range presents an equal opportunity, then each side
determines initiative by rolling basic Prowess →
Agility + Reaction focus, the side with the highest
result acting first.

The player characters always win ties between a PC
and non-player characters or legendary monsters
(see GM Section to understand such designations for
opponents).

If multiple PCs share the same battle phase, the
players                               may narratively determine the order of
actions through teamwork and coordination. If a
decision cannot be reached or if the situation
demands a random resolution, the character with the
highest Agility score acts first. In case of a tie, a
Speed or Reaction focus grants precedence. If those
are similar, use Agility MV. Ties between two NPCs
attacking each other are resolved in descending
order of range or weapon reach, or the GM may force
a re-roll.

Surprise

To determine surprise, characters roll Prowess →
Agility                                → Reaction against the target's saving throw
(for basic creatures) or Competence → Perception →
Alertness (for full-fledged NPCs). Success grants
simple surprises, in which defenders lose their first
round of attacks but retain active defense. Total
surprise requires two successful rolls, causing
defenders to lose all actions and active defense in the
first round. GMs may opt for group checks based on
the most relevant ability. Advanced scouts, sentries,
precognition, or magic can counter surprise
attempts.

Any character can attempt to use stealth to gain
surprise.                              To do so, roll Competence → Adroitness →
Skulduggery against the target's standard saving
throw (for basic creatures) or Perception (for full-
fledged NPCs). Success grants a +2 bonus to surprise
rolls. While Rogues excel at this due to their class, it
is not exclusive to them. For group ambushes, one
character first succeeds on a stealth check, followed
by a group check that may include the stealth bonus.

Surprise attacks like Backstab or Death Strike
generally                             target the saving throw of basic creatures
or the perception of full-fledged NPCs. These attacks
can greatly increase damage and effects, particularly
when iconic weapons are involved. In such cases,
complete surprise eliminates the need for additional
mastery expenditures to bypass defenses.

67


Movement

Movement in the Eldritch RPG is usually abstract.
Players                           describe such movement as necessary, while
the GM tracks how it will affect actions and timing.
Occasionally, judging initiative and distance
becomes important for tactical or dramatic
situations. In that case, maximum movement is
determined by character or creature Prowess. The
following determines how far a character or other
humanoid may move in a round and how it affects
attacks.

•Movement = 12 + Prowess MV in yards per round (attack
without                         penalty)

•Running — Movement ×2 (attack with a penalty, –3)

•Sprinting — Movement ×4 (no attack possible at the end
of                                the movement)

This is a base move of 16 yards per round at d4
rank,                            up to 24 yards per round at d12. Then add +1
yard per die rank of the Agility specialty.

Movement rates of 16/ 20/ 24 yards per round
correspond to walking at 3/ 4/ 5 miles per hour,
which are normal/ fit/ heroic levels of motion for
people — although animals and monsters often
move much faster!

For example, Swift the rogue has Prowess d10,
Agility                               d8. He can walk briskly and engage without
penalty at 12+10+3 = 25 yards per round (10 seconds)
or 5 yards per battle phase (2 seconds). Swift could
cover 50 yards per round running or 100 sprinting
(10 or 20 yards per battle phase).

COMBAT

The Attack Action

A standard attempt to inflict damage in Eldritch
requires                                no “to-hit” roll, unlike some role-playing
game systems. Instead, once the attacker chooses the
attack method, he rolls the dice to determine threat
points, representing potential harm. This will be
effective and damaging unless the defender can
avoid or reduce the threat by some means.

A shield reduces harm by a set amount if the
defender                         has one and has active defense points.

The defender can then choose to use an active
defense                              to avoid the threat. He might describe this
action as parrying with a weapon, sidestepping the
attack, or jumping out of the way. This reduces
potential harm by the calculated number of active
defense points.

If the threat points from the attack exceed any
active defense and shield, any armor worn can
reduce the threat.

If the threat points have not been completely
negated                               at this point, the remainder deplete passive
defense points. If the defender’s passive defense hit
points score falls to zero or below, he becomes
unconscious. If the score falls to the negative
Fortitude MV, he might die (see Healing and Dying
section).

Calculating Total Potential Harm

A character's total attack Potential Harm is determined by their weapon, specialization, and focus
abilities. Threat and Ranged Threat focuses enhance melee and ranged attacks, respectively.

Using an Iconic Weapon increases threat points by +1 per level and allows the incorporation of a 
second
focus                                                                (if possessed) based on the 
weapon's damage type (Might for Crushing, Ferocity for Slashing, or
Speed for Impaling). Iconic Weapons, when used with a mastery die, can also trigger special a 
"master
twist" effect, positively altering outcomes of an otherwise disappointing roll. See Iconic Weapons 
in the
Equipment Chapter for details.

68


Attacking

Step one: Attacker rolls to determine potential
harm.                          Normally, only one attack per creature is
permitted (but see Special feats later). The total
threat points are determined by adding the result of
attack rolls.

Specific focuses also grant bonuses to threat points
(Threat                              focus) or initiative (Finesse focus) when the
character specializes in the Melee or Precision attack
abilities. A focus in Wizardry or Theurgy can also
grant bonuses to threat points.

Weapon Attack: Prowess → Melee + Threat focus.

Ranged Weapon Attack: Prowess → Precision +
Ranged Threat focus.

Unarmed or Natural Attack: Prowess → Melee +
Threat focus.

Magic Spell Attack: Competence → Expertise +
Wizardry focus or Theurgy focus.

Iconic Weapon Bonus: If using an Iconic Weapon,
the                          player adds an additional bonus of +1 per
character level.

Damage Type Focus Bonus: If the character
possesses                              a focus matching the weapon's damage
type (Might for Crushing, Ferocity for Slashing, or
Speed for Impaling), they add that bonus as well.

Step two: Defenders with shields reduce threat
points                                by 1–3 (depending on shield size) before using
Active Defense points. Shields contribute to a
character’s overall defensive potential. Regardless of
how the player describes their defensive actions—
whether parrying, dodging, or countering—the
shield’s mitigation is inherently part of the defense
as long as it is held. This reduction represents the
shield’s contribution to the character’s deliberate
defense, working in concert with dodging, parrying,
or countering maneuvers.

Active Defense points must remain above zero for
the                           shield’s reduction to apply, as it reflects a
conscious effort to utilize the shield effectively. Any
remaining threat after shield reduction depletes the
defender’s Active Defense pool. If the pool is
exhausted, proceed to the next step.

Step three: (if applicable): Defenders wearing
armor                            subtract a random die roll from the remaining
threat points, with the rank of the die dependent on
armor type (d4 hide, d6 leather, d8 chain, d10 plate,
d12 mithral armor.) Any remaining harm depletes
passive defense, causing actual bodily damage.

Example: A level 1 warrior, equipped with a short
sword,                             attacks a human opponent armed with a
sword and shield, wearing chainmail, and possessing
12 hit points (6 active/6 passive). The warrior’s
Prowess (Melee) and weapon specialty grant 2d4+1
for their attack, yielding a potential threat range of
3–9 points. The warrior rolls a 7 on their threat dice.

The defender’s small shield automatically reduces
the                            threat by 1 point, lowering it to 6. The defender
then uses their Active Defense pool of 6 points to
negate the remaining threat, emerging unscathed.

Interpretations of Prowess Ability

Rules never trump character concepts. Whether the
character concept is brawny, or merely fast and
nimble is immaterial; if a PC uses a two-handed
sword or a rapier, he is assumed to be strong or
dexterous enough to wield it. If the player makes his
character a weakling who cannot wield a certain
weapon, that is fine. It may be that the PC prefers
light, fast weapons, so his die rank is interpreted in
terms of accuracy or quickness.

Increasing die rank in Prowess specialties
represents                       increasing reflexes, force, accuracy, or
blending of the three, depending on the attack
method used.

69


Attack Types

COMBAT

A basic magical attack targets a single creature


Untrained Attacks

Most humanoid creatures have and every player
character                             have a d4 rank in Prowess. This represents
the basic ability to brawl, swing a weapon, or shoot
something rather than a martial discipline. Anybody
can pick up an object and swing or throw it, whether
a tree branch or a heavy sword.

Also, heroes in a fantasy world ought to be familiar
enough                               with conventional missile weapons to pick
up the average short bow or crossbow and fire it.

Characters using only basic Prowess roll a d4 for
untrained                              attacks with no specific weapon bonuses
added. A higher rank in basic Prowess represents
either increasing general knowledge of martial
techniques, excellent eyesight, aim, or just natural
talent, the interpretation depending on the character
concept or monster description.

Melee Attacks

A Melee specialty under Prowess grants expertise
with                        several different forms of attack (hand-to-
hand combat or unarmed brawling).

The properties of each weapon show whether the
focus areas of Threat (potential harm increase) or
Finesse (bonus to initiative) apply when the
character is specialized in Melee and when that
specific weapon is wielded.

Focus areas in Threat or Finesse allow adding +1 up
to                                 +5 either to potential harm or to initiative
respectively.

Magic Attacks

Woe to any creature assailed by one gifted with
knowledge                                of the arcane! Luckily, not all beings are
capable of wielding magic to attack their enemies.

The universal spell Eldritch Bolt serves as the basic
magic attack, requiring no ability test.

within line of sight. The mage rolls Competence →
Expertise (+ Wizardry or Theurgy) to determine
threat points.

Such spells manifest physically and visibly, by
touch                                or at the stated range, and can be dodged by
using active defense. However, not all spells are
easily blocked, parried, or dodged. Some may bypass
active defense points or even armor protection (see
the Harm listing in the part of the GM’s section).

Ranged Attacks

A specialty in Precision grants greater skill with any
type of ranged weapon requiring martial skill.

A focus in Ranged Finesse represents honed skill
and                             aim, natural talent, or all of them, and usually
increases the initiative bonus or occasionally threat
points (e.g., the Great Bow).

Unarmed or Natural Attacks

Beasts and dangerous animals use natural weapons
such                             as teeth and claws, and such attacks are listed
as “Natural” threat rank category in creature stat
blocks.

In addition, some creatures use unusual, ranged
attacks,                            like the projectile quills of a manticore, the
acidic spit of a giant frog, or a giant who routinely
rips trees out of the earth and hurls them at human
pests. Creature stat blocks subsume all ranged
attacks under a “Ranged” threat rank category.

When an armed foe parries an unarmed attacker,
the                           attacker suffers potential damage equal to a roll
of the defending target's Melee basic rank. If armor
does not reduce threat points, this damage deducts
directly from passive defense points (shield is
disallowed).

Unarmed mystic attacks, as well as natural attacks
by                            beasts and dangerous animals, are treated as
normal Melee, with no penalty for facing armed
attackers.

Battle Conditions

Distance and Cover Penalties

Distance and cover penalties to Ranged attacks are
often unnecessary. The rules deal

with range abstractly; if
the attacker can see

his target, just roll
the         dice. Remember,
in the Eldritch RPG,
the attack and
damage roll are
expressed together
as threat points.

However, if the GM
still        wishes to
consider distance

penalties, some general
guidelines apply:

Range

Close range to short-range carries no penalties to a
ranged attack. A shot at medium range imposes a
penalty of –1 damage per die rolled, while a shot at
long range imposes a penalty of —2 damage per die
rolled. See below for common missile weapon range
increments.

Missile Weapon Ranges

Weapon — (short / medium / long range in feet) —
Damage Type

Compound Bow—Ranged 50’/100’/300’—Impaling
Crossbow,                  Heavy—Ranged 55’/115’/200’—Impaling
Crossbow, Light—Ranged 75’/150’/300’—Impaling
Dagger (thrown)—Ranged 10’/30’/50’—Impaling
Longbow—Ranged 30’/75’/150’—Impaling
Shortbow—Ranged 20’/50’/100’—Impaling
Sling—Ranged 10’/20’/50’—Crushing
Spear—Ranged 10’/30’/50’—Impaling

Throwing Axe Ranged— 10’/30’/50’—Slashing

71

Partial to full cover

Each level of cover subtracts from the attack’s
damage.                              It is possible to hit a target behind total
cover, assuming the weapon used could penetrate
the cover. For example, a longbow arrow can easily
penetrate a cheap wooden table.

Note: Lying prone would provide the equivalent
of                      moderate cover but would disallow the use
of any active defense points.

Minimal Cover (¼) — subtracts 1 point.
Moderate                        Cover (½) — subtracts 2 points.
Good Cover (¾) — subtracts 3 points.

Total Cover —GM’s call. If the target is
behind a parapet or oak tree, they’re

safe, except for area effect spells. If they’re
behind                                a curtain like Polonius in Hamlet, they could
be stabbed in the arras!

Iconic Attacks

Every character may possess a iconic weapon or a
spellcasting focus called an iconic item, granting
greater variety and color to their attacks. An iconic
item, whether it is a weapon or a focus (such as a
holy symbol or an attuned wand), grants more
options in fighting styles and allows greater
variation in ability combinations when making
attacks.

In addition, making an iconic attack with mastery
(as                           limited by level) triggers the possibility of a
master twist effect.

Example: A Theurgist wielding their family's ancestral
mace                               (Might +3, Iconic Weapon +1 per level) attempts to
smite an undead horror. The player rolls their Prowess
(Melee) dice, adding their Might focus and Iconic
Weapon bonus for threat points, plus their mastery die
for good measure. The lowest possible roll on their
mastery die (a 1) would allow for a "master twist,"
adding an extra mastery die roll to the total, embodying
the weapon's amplified power against the undead.


COMBAT


Master Twist with Iconic Attack: If the character
opts                                to use the mastery die with an iconic attack and
the die rolls its minimum value, the die can be
immediately re-rolled, and the new result added to
the total. This twist of fate turns a potentially poor
roll into a chance for greater success. See the Game
Master's section for more details on master twist
effects. Iconic items such as spellcasting foci may
have other special abilities or augmentations that
enhance the character's spellcasting abilities.

Defense Pool Scores

Defense point pools are hit points divided into self-
protective actions or harm mitigation in all the ways
the character can endure damage. They are
organized into the active and passive defense pools,
each a pool of ablative hit points, as described below.

Active Defense

The active defense hit point pool is the first mode of
defense against attack (threat points). The active
defense pool is the total max value of the Prowess +
Agility + Melee dice added up. It typically involves
parrying with a weapon or dodging.

Active defense points are fully refreshed after
escaping                               or ending combat. Generally, a minute to
catch one’s breath is enough. The full point total of
active defense points is usable by the character
regardless of the weapon wielded. A character may
switch between weapons at will. For game purposes,
the mechanic is the same, but it makes a narrative
difference.

Certain weapons may be limited in their capacity to
deflect attacks from larger weapons or to dodge
them. For example, even a parrying dagger cannot be
used to parry or dodge weapons larger or heavier
than a medium sword, and a utility knife cannot
defend against any axe. The common-sense
arbitration of such situations is left to the GM.

Once active defense points hit points reach zero, the
character is too exhausted to defend himself with his
weapons or to dodge and must find other means of
protecting himself until withdrawal and
revitalization is possible (see below).

Augment, Drain, or Revitalize

The active defense pool primarily represents dodging
and                           parrying the attacks of opponents but is also an
overall measure of fatigue. The active defense score
can thus be temporarily augmented or reduced by
other factors.

Augment or Drain

Spell powers or magic items with buffing effects can
increase the score, either by increasing a linked
ability die rank (Prowess, Agility specialty, or Melee
specialty) or through spells that increase the active
defense hit point score directly. Likewise, the active
defense score can be drained by spells that
specifically reduce the active defense score, while
other spells target spirit points first (psychic
damage), if they do not bypass active defense
altogether.

Revitalize (Second Wind)

If a combatant is not in close combat, they can
choose                            Revitalize, forgoing their action for one
round to recover Active Defense points. If engaged in
close combat, they must first use a full action to
perform a Tactical Withdrawal, moving at least 5 feet
away from their opponent while facing them. After
creating distance, they can Revitalize on their next
turn.

GM Note: Players must announce whether they will use
their active defense before the GM’s roll to prevent
meta-gaming, such as opting not to use active defense
because they believe their armor can absorb the hit.

Conversely, some GMs prefer to reveal the enemy
attack’s                            strength in advance, giving characters a better
idea of the incoming threat.

72


Dangerous Environs (Optional)

Dangerous environments (dungeon corridor,
haunted                           house, muddy swamp) may slow recovery
time immediately after combat, up to 10 minutes.
The GM decides.

Passive Defense

The passive defense pool comprises the physical
body,                           including the ability to withstand fatigue, and
some degree of spiritual resilience. It is the last layer
of defense against damage (threat points) when all
else fails.

The passive defense pool is the total max value of
Fortitude + Endurance + Strength dice.

This defense pool recovers slowly, 1 hit point per
day of rest or 2 hit points per day of total bed rest
unless aided by magic or

healing ability.

Spirit Points

Spirit points can be used to gain
an              inspired advantage in
combat or other dire
circumstances, to augment a
feat or powerful magic spell
(when indicated in the
description), or to invoke the

powers of magic items and spell effects using
intuition and will.

Spirit points are the total of a character’s
Competence + Willpower max value.

Spirit points are fully refreshed once the individual is
safe from the threat of physical, psychic, or magical
harm.

Spirit Points - Actions

Invoke: With this action, the character invokes the
magic                                of a magic item or activates the spell effect
written in scrolls, grimoires, or by reading runes or
glyphs on walls or other surfaces. Cost is a number of
spirit points equal to the rarity or power rank of the
magic item or magic effect (see page 168).

Inspiration: The character gathers his inner strength
to                               add an inspirational bonus to an ability, feat, spell,
or attack roll. It costs 4 spirit points for every +1
bonus to an attack roll or ability test.

Panache: Characters can unleash a burst of
inspiration                                 to activate a feat without needing an
ability test. This action represents a surge of energy
channeled in a moment of quick thinking and daring,
often amid danger. The cost equals the maximum

value of the relevant Challenge Die rank.

Surge: This action allows characters to spend
spirit                        points for an additional use of their
mastery die after exhausting daily uses. Surge
symbolizes a character tapping into deep
reserves of energy and focus to push beyond
limits. To use Surge, characters spend spirit
points equal to the mastery die rank (d4 at
level 1, d6 at level 2, d8 at level 3, d10 at level
4, or d12 at level 5) and roll the mastery die,
adding the result to their ability, feat, spell
test, or attack roll. Characters must exhaust

their regular mastery die rolls before using Surge.
The                           spirit point cost cannot exceed the character's
mastery die Maximum Value (MV), which is tied to
their level.

Quickening: The character spends spirit points equal
to                               the maximum challenge die value to cast a spell
quickly, bypassing the ability test. Necessary
challenge checks for enhancements still apply. This
can be used once per round.

73


Combat Options

Dual Wielding

Any character may choose to fight with a weapon in
each hand, provided the off-hand weapon is smaller
and lighter. Basic dual wielding lets one quickly
switch between weapons to vary tactics. Use the
primary weapon to determine the ability branch and
add the bonuses for both weapons when modifying
damage. A Melee focus in Finesse allows a
coordinated attack. In this case, roll one attack roll
for each weapon wielded, but the second weapon
only gets a roll of the base ability die rank.

COMBAT

Tactical Withdrawal

A tactical withdrawal means retreating as a full
action                                 in a round (at least 5 feet) while still facing the
foe to avoid or fend off any attack. Performing a
tactical withdrawal is prerequisite to using the
revitalize action. This maneuver is useful for
repositioning oneself, making ranged attacks, or
avoiding being flanked.

Revitalize Action

Invigorate: If out of close combat, a combatant can
choose to forgo action for a round to rest and
revitalize. Doing so allows for a roll of Prowess +


Also, only a 4th level or higher barbarian or warrior
may                             wield two weapons of the same size. Dual-
wielding always incurs a one battle phase penalty. If
the character’s initiative is already 1–4, apply a –1
penalty to the Agility specialty initiative modifier.

Opportune Attack

An attack of opportunity allows a PC or NPC an extra,
single                               attack with the full ability branch against a
target with which he is engaged. This is a free attack
action at close range with a hand-to-hand weapon
or an unarmed attack. Use this option in three
circumstances:

•The target turns his back in close combat and runs
away without performing a tactical withdrawal. No
target defense points are possible in this case.

•The target uses a ranged attack at point-blank
range                         against an armed foe (unless the target is a
master of the ranged weapon being used).

•The target casts a magic spell when engaged in close
combat. The spell is not disrupted unless the magic-
wielder takes damage directly to the passive defense
pool.

Vitality (focus bonus). The result is added back to the
character's Active Defense hit points. If the character
is engaged in close combat, they must first perform a
tactical withdrawal.

Deep Recovery: A combatant may forgo action for a
round and spend 1 spirit point to regain Prowess
(MV) + Vitality (focus bonus) in active defense hit
points.

Steady Renewal: If a character continues to
Revitalize                               into a second round, they can choose
Steady Renewal. They regain 25% of their active
defense pool hit points, plus an additional 10% for
each spirit point spent, up to the character’s
maximum active defense. Steady Renewal requires a
full action to perform.

74


Order of Defenses

1. Shields: Shields inherently mitigate threat points
as                               part of a character’s overall defensive effort,
reducing damage before any Active Defense points
are depleted. This reduction reflects the shield’s
integration into the defender’s deliberate actions,
such as parrying, dodging, or countering. The
shield’s damage reduction applies only if the
defender’s Active Defense points are above zero, and
the reduction depends on the shield type held.

2. Active Defense: After shield mitigation, any
remaining                             threat points are deducted from the
target’s Active Defense pool. If the Active Defense
pool is sufficient to absorb all remaining threat
points, the defense holds, and no further steps are
necessary.

3. Armor: If threat points penetrate the Active
Defense                            pool, armor provides an additional layer of
protection. Roll for damage reduction based on the
armor type worn: d4 for hide, d6 for leather, d8 for
chainmail, and d10 for plate armor.

4. Passive defense: Passive defense is a measure of
how                              much physical punishment a character can take
before dropping unconscious or dying.

Defense Negation

In normal combat, attacks and spells deplete Active
Defense                              before affecting armor and passive defense.
However, some feats and powerful spells can bypass
these defenses, allowing them to disregard armor,
drain Spirit Points, or directly impact passive
defense. Defense negation can involve bypassing the
Active Defense ablative score, negating armor, or
rendering shields ineffective.

Bypassing Active Defense: Feats, spells, and creature
powers                                can bypass the Active Defense ablative score
by requiring a successful d12 challenge die roll and
the expenditure of 5 Spirit Points. This reflects the
precision and focus needed to overcome such

defenses. The Active Defense score represents a
character’s                              ability to dodge, parry, or otherwise
avoid harm in combat. By bypassing Active Defense,
the spell or ability ignores the target’s evasive
maneuvers, making them more susceptible to
damage.

Affliction Effects: These magical effects bypass the
Active Defense score and require a saving throw to
resist. Powerful afflictions, such as mind control or
incapacitation, can strip all agency from the target
and necessitate the expenditure of a mastery die.

Defense-Negating Harm Spells or Attacks: Harm
spells                               or attacks that include defense negation can
bypass various forms of defense, directly affecting
the target’s passive defense. These spells or abilities
might bypass one or more of the following defenses,
depending on their design:

•Bypass Armor (d4 to d12; 1-5 Spirit Points): The
spell                                or ability can negate the target’s armor up to
the maximum allowed by the spell. The challenge die
for this effect is equal to the armor’s die rank. For
example, bypassing plate mail (d10) requires a
successful d10 roll and 10 Spirit Points.

•Bypass Shielding (d8 to d12; 3-5 Spirit Points): The
spell negates the opponent’s held or magical shield
up to the maximum allowed by the spell. The
challenge die is d8 for a -1 shield, requiring 3 Spirit
Points; d10 for a -2 shield, requiring 4 Spirit Points;
and d12 for a -3 shield, requiring 5 Spirit Points.
When combined with a Harm effect, the spell can
bypass the target’s shield up to -3 reduction.

•Bypassing Active Defense: As described, bypassing
the                            Active Defense ablative score requires a
successful d12 challenge die roll and the expenditure
of 5 Spirit Points.

75


COMBAT


A spell or feat may use one or multiple forms of
defense                         negation, depending on its design. For
instance, a spell might bypass only the target’s
armor, or it might bypass both armor and the Active

challenge die rolls and Spirit Point expenditures. The
specific combinations and requirements for defense

Saving Throws: Saving throws are the last line of
defense                             against defense negation effects. Generally,
any effect that bypasses all possible modes of the
Active Defense score (parry, dodge, or block) or
deprives the target of agency in play qualifies for a
saving throw. Examples include mind control,
paralysis, forced teleportation, and effects

that incapacitate or restrain.

Healing and Dying

Passive defense is a measure of how much physical
punishment a character can take before dropping
unconscious or dying. A character is unconscious
when reaching a zero passive defense pool, but can
survive damage up to a negative number equal to
Fortitude’s Max Value. So, a PC with basic Fortitude
of d8 will die at –8, and so on.

Characters may roll Fortitude → Endurance →
Vitality                           every round to keep going and avoid falling
unconscious.

THE ORDER OF DEFENSES

Fill out the character sheet with the shield damage reduction number, used
whenever                                               the shield is used in combat, and then list 
your active defense score.
These are the hit points reduced to zero before any armor is rolled to absorb the

excess damage.

Fill in armor die size (d4 for hide, d6 for leather, d8 for chain, and d10 for plate).
Passive                                              defense is the final score affected, the last 
line of defense before a character
is knocked out or killed.

Some optional races may have natural armor as an option (see Ainerêve setting
book).                                               In such cases, use the highest die-rank if 
armor is also worn.


All willful and reflexive defensive actions taken by a
combatant—such as parrying, sidestepping, dodging, or
integrating a shield into their defense—are represented by
the Active Defense pool. This first line of defense reflects a
combatant’s skill and eflort, with the pool depleting
quickly in combat (simulating fatigue) but refreshing just
as rapidly once combat ends. Shields contribute to this
overall defensive eflort by reducing threat points by 1 to 3
(depending on shield type) before the remaining threat is
applied to the Active Defense pool, blending into the
character’s deliberate and reflexive actions.

Chapter 4:
Magic


agic in the Eldritch RPG is considered rare
but                   versatile and powerful. All magic

channeled and manipulated by creatures of the
universe                               is governed by the Competence ability, the
Expertise specialty, and the feats of the spell casting
classes. In most cases, the learning and casting of
magic spells require the Gift of Magic advantage.

This chapter explains spells, their paths (sources of
power), and the rules underlying all magic in the
game. Magic spells are incantations that tap into the
weave of magic or invoke the gods' favor to cause
various effects, whether beneficial or malign. Ritual
magic uses arcane glyphs and runic symbols, usually
inscribed into objects, to create items with various

magical effects.

Learning Spells

For mages and adepts, the art of learning
magic                        involves studying ancient grimoires and

esoteric knowledge, tapping into the weave
of                       magic inherent to a universe manifest
from dreams. Dweomercraft, the tradition

of wizards, is usually taught and practiced
through                   mentorship.

Theurgists, on the other hand, channel magic
fueled                           by prayer or ardent belief. Fealty and duty

to the deities, whether within a formal
priesthood                       or as a religious recluse, is one

way the Gift of Magic is earned, with
supernatural abilities a direct gift
from a god or lesser servant.

79

Spell Casting

Spells are occult or religious incantations and rituals
combining will and word to produce a defined result.

Mages, adepts, and mystics (collectively called
wizards)                            call spells dweomers, while theurgists
(priests, druids) call them miracles, but although
names, power sources, and practitioners differ, all
spells are cast in much the same way. The paths of
magic are particular arcane or divine sources of
magical knowledge and power, each with its own
characteristic styles of offensive, defensive, and
general-purpose spells.

Spells are cast using Competence → Expertise
(Wizardry                             or Theurgy).

Practitioners of magic tend to follow a specific
path,                                and are familiar with that path’s named spells
(those that have been written down and refined over
the ages). This means they understand them in
principle, even if they initially find some too difficult
to cast.

Spells learned and cast by those with the Gift of
Magic do not cost spirit points unless the spell's
description specifies a cost or involves defense
negation, multi-effects, or casting an unlearned
spell from a scroll or grimoire.


MAGIC


Initial Spell Selection:

At character creation, magic-wielders can choose a
number of spells from any spell list based on their
Competence → Expertise dice. They gain initial
access to two spells for each die rank in Competence
and in Expertise.

For example, a character with a Competence of d6
and an Expertise of d4 would have a total of 3 die
rank steps and access to 6 known spells. Adepts
begin with half the initial spells of other magic-
wielders, reflecting their focus on ritual magic and
the crafting of magical items and potions, rather
than on spell diversity.

These initial spells must be Common
or               Uncommon.

Learning Higher
Rarity        Spells:

To learn Esoteric, Occult,
or        Legendary spells,
characters must

usually embark on
quests            or other
adventures during the
campaign. However,
adventuring alone
does not automatically
add spells to a
character’s repertoire.

Cross-Discipline Spellcasting: Characters with
the                           Gift of Magic can learn a limited number of
spells from a secondary focus within their
Expertise specialty. The number of spells
learnable equals their focus bonus in the
secondary focus. For example, a Mage with a +3
Theurgy focus could learn up to three Theurgy
spells, provided they have the necessary
training or resources (like finding a spellbook
or receiving instruction from a Theurgist)

Increasing Spell Repertoire Slots:

Advancing in die ranks of either Competence or
Expertise                         increases a character's ability to learn
more spells of any rarity. Each time a character goes
up in a die rank in either Competence or Expertise,
he or she gains an additional two slots for their
potential repertoire.

These slots can be filled (with new spells learned or
discovered) at the first narratively appropriate
moment from any spell list

Learning Additional Spells:

Characters can add newly discovered spells or spells
taught                                to them by characters of the same class to

their repertoire by spending enough time and
making an ability roll to learn the formula.

However, magic-wielders can only
learn                   new spells listed along with

their character class.

To learn a new spell from a
teacher, scroll, or tome of

magic, or through prayer or
meditation, magic-wielders
roll Competence → Expertise

+ Wizardry or Theurgy against
the                spell’s challenge rating,
which is determined by its rarity.
The time it takes to learn a new
spell (through transcription or

memorization) is 5 days, adjusted
down                   by one full day for every bonus

point in Wizardry or Theurgy focus.

Successfully learning the spell means adding it to the
character's repertoire.

Discovering New Spells

The elf mage Taldoran finds a scroll with unknown
runes                             in ancient ruins. The GM tells him it's an
Esoteric spell. After five days, Taldoran
(Competence d10, Expertise d8, Wizardry +3)
deciphers the scroll and adds the new spell to his
repertoire.

80


Level-Based Repertoire Increase:

All magic-wielding classes can choose one new path
spell                              when advancing to their next character level.

The rarity levels they may choose from for their
bonus                           spell also increase with character level
(Uncommon at 2nd level, Esoteric at 3rd, Occult at
4th, and Legendary at 5th).

Activating a Spell

To cast a spell in the Eldritch RPG, practitioners
must                             make a test. If the player’s total is equal to or
higher than the challenge die roll, the magic takes
effect (although success may depend on additional
opposed rolls). A magic-wielder always rolls
Competence → Expertise, adding any focus in
Wizardry or Theurgy. Failing to meet or exceed the
challenge die results in failure and may incur other
penalties (see Spell Failure Table, page 85).

The mastery die can be used on path spells a limited
number of times per day in combat or challenging
non-combat situations.

Spell Challenge and Maintenance Penalty

D8 (Difficult)     Esoteric     -3
D10 (Demanding)  Occult       -4
D12 (Formidable)  Legendary    -5

Maintenance Penalty

Each spell maintained causes a penalty to any ability
tests                            while concentrating on maintaining its magical
effects. These penalties stack when maintaining
multiple spell effects.

The maximum duration of a maintained spell is
equal                              to the caster's Competence → Expertise +
Wizardry or Theurgy bonus maximum MV score in
rounds.

If a spell is maintained beyond this limit, a
concentration check is required each additional
round with a target number based on the spell's
maintenance penalty. If the check fails, all spells
fizzle. Instant spells cannot be maintained.

Spell Structure

The Gift of Magic advantage is the only prerequisite
for                          learning spells or channeling magical energy.

Membership in a magic-using class is not strictly
required,                        although that is the only way to access
specific class feats. The broadly known types of
magic are Wizardry (mages and mystics), Theurgy
(priests and druids) and Arcanum (artificing and
ritual magic). Those without the Gift of Magic
advantage have a rudimentary understanding of
magic, allowing them to attempt to activate a spell
from an inscribed item or written formulary.

81


MAGIC


However, their ability to use magic is limited, and
they risk an energy backlash if the attempt fails,
potentially leading to lethal consequences.

Spell Descriptions

All spells use the following format: Spell name,
Challenge—Rarity—Effect, Type/Target, and
Description

Spell Name

The name simply identifies the spell. Named spells
are                             those that have been written down and refined
over the ages, and the common spells at least will be
known about (if not necessarily learned) by
practitioners of magic.

Spell Challenge

The challenge roll, except for Harm, determines the
success of a spell. Harm spells require an attack roll,
with modifications needing a challenge die roll. Even
if modifications fail, basic harm remains.

Spell challenge, rarity, potency, and modifiers are
interconnected.

Spell Potency

The challenge die corresponds to the spell's potency
level,                          which determines its rarity.

Each potency level has an associated modifier,
either                      positive or negative.

Potency Level 1: d4 / Common / ±1
Potency                     Level 2: d6 / Uncommon / ±2
Potency Level 3: d8 / Esoteric / ±3
Potency Level 4: d10 / Occult / ±4

Potency Level 5: d12 or above / Legendary / ±5

For targets and areas of effect, refer to the Spell
Challenge and Maintenance Penalty Table.

Spell Rarity

All spells are assigned a rarity level, either Common,
Uncommon, Esoteric, Occult, or Legendary, which
indicates not only their casting difficulty but also
their likelihood of being found in treasure hoards,
spellbooks, and the memories of NPCs.

Spell Effect

These give a quick indication of what the spell does:
Activate,                              Afflict, Harm, Modify, Protect, and Restore.
As explained in the section, these effects are
building blocks of all spells.

Activate (in the sense of causing an event or a
change) covers miscellaneous spells not fitting
neatly into the other categories. -Effects include
benefits like new temporary powers, divine favor,
useful non-combat spells, luck, and so on.

Afflict covers physical and mental abilities, from
knocking someone prone to controlling their mind.

Harm effects are magical attacks that sometimes
incorporate afflictions.

Modify effects either augment or curse abilities or
equipment.

Protect effects involve magic shielding and armor.

Restore effects can heal and restore, eliminate
fatigue,                            cure diseases, or even raise the dead, while
the flip-side of this power, Destroy, includes spells
that inflict damage or destruction, such as
disintegration or corrosion spells, and those that
corrupt or decay.

82


Type/Target

This starts with a brief notation in square brackets of
the type/target.

Duration Type: There are two types of spell duration:
M                               for maintainable and Inst for instantaneous.

Maintainable spells, unlike instantaneous spells,
last                               for one round (10 seconds) initially, and can be
extended for a maximum number of rounds equal to
the caster's MV in their relevant ability branch.

Extending a spell incurs a Maintenance Penalty,
affecting                             other ability tests, not attack rolls or threat
points. The penalty increases for each round and
each additional spell maintained, and its severity
depends on the spell's challenge rank (from -1 for d4
spells to -5 for d12 spells).

Targets: Spell targets determine the affected
entities: Self, Creature, Area, or Object. Attack spells
focus on single or multiple creatures, areas, and
occasionally                           objects.

They manifest as 1 ft-diameter bolts (mana or
energy                            bolts, etc.) or 2 ft-wide streams (e.g., fire or
other elemental attacks), both evadable through
defense. Bolts deliver instantanous harm, while
streams cause continuous harm or deter enemies.

Some spells influence multiple targets or areas,
using                               the primary target as the default origin. Spell
descriptions specify effects, conditions, and
modifiers. To cast an attack spell, the caster must see
the target or origin point.

Magic Effects and Parameters

Other characteristics of a spell that are not listed
with                            each spell entry usually rest on the ability test
rather than individual spell differences. These
characteristics tend to follow general rules and
tables.

Spell Range and Area of Effect

The maximum range for a spell or feat is determined
by                               the caster’s ability in the relevant branch. This is
calculated by taking the Maximum Value (MV) of the
caster’s combined die ranks in the Competence →
Expertise branch and multiplying it by 4. If the spell
or feat is activated with a mastery die, this range is
doubled.

The spell’s Area of Effect (AoE) is calculated by
doubling the caster’s Competence → Expertise MV
and adding their wizard or Theurgy bonus MV. The
spell defines the shape of the AoE. If a mastery die
activates the spell, its volume doubles.

Maintained Effects: Only some persistent spell
effects                                can be maintained beyond the caster’s line of
sight, indicated by individual spell or power (and
increasing the maintenance penalty by at least –1 per
round; GM fiat).

Touch-based Spells: Modify spells to target
creatures                              within reach, enhancing their success rate.
These spells are occasionally designated as
“Creature or Self,” assuming the creature is within
touch range. In other cases, ranged spells can be
changed into touch spells if the caster can physically
make contact with the target, granting a +2 bonus on
ability tests. The Game Master’s judgment is
necessary to determine if a spell is eligible for
modification. Keep communication lines open and
provide thorough descriptions when the position of a
target or the area of effect is ambiguous.

Spell Casting Modifiers

Spell modifiers, unlike mage dweomers, modify the
ability test when performed. The player rolls only
once regardless of the attack and must meet or beat
the challenge die result. Some spells present casting
modifiers as options, and others are baked into the
spell’s formula and unmalleable.

83


MAGIC


Increase Area of Effect: Increases the area affected
by                              the spell. Each die rank increase in the challenge
die doubles the area of effect.

Increase/Decrease Effect: Modifies the intensity of
the spell's effect. Each die rank increase in the
challenge die adds +1 to the effect (up to +5).

Bypass Armor/Shields: Allows the spell to ignore
some                             or all of the target's armor or shield. The
challenge die rank equals the armor or shield's die
rank.

Change Duration: Alters the duration of the spell.
Each                              die rank increase in the challenge die increases
the duration.

Distributed Harm: This casting modifier allows
magic                             wielders to allocate the damage dice of a Harm
spell among multiple targets. The caster divides the
spell’s effect dice, ensuring that each target receives
at least one whole die, and dice cannot be split
further (e.g., a d8 cannot become two d4s). For
example, a spell with 3d8 damage could assign 2d8
to one target and 1d8 to another or allocate 1d8 to
each of three targets. The caster declares this
distribution before rolling and then makes a single
casting check. If the check succeeds, all targets take
the allocated damage; failure causes the spell to
fizzle entirely. This modifier applies only to Harm
spells with discrete damage dice and excludes area-
effect spells or those with secondary effects unless
otherwise specified by the Game Master. Players
must clearly communicate their dice allocation, and
the Game Master should adjudicate any edge cases,
such as interacting with spell effects beyond pure
damage.

Unlocking Ranked Spell Effects

Some spells include ranked effects that can only be
activated by magic-wielders with a specific branch
proficiency level. These ranked effects represent
advanced spell potency and complexity, requiring a
minimum branch rank to unlock. Not all casting
modifiers are tied to branch proficiency; some have
alternative costs or requirements, such as increased
Spirit Point expenditure, additional material
components, or longer casting times.

Rank to Unlock Higher Rarity Effects

Weak (1-3)d4 (Common)
Average              (4+)d6 (Uncommon)
Respectable (12+)d8 (Esoteric)
Skilled (16+)d10 (Occult)
Great (20+)d12 (Legendary)

Phenomenal (24+) d12+ (Legendary+)

This table links a character’s branch rank to the
potency                              level required to unlock higher-rarity effects
in spells. Unlockable effects must be fixed-rank (not
variable) and have a higher rarity than the base spell.
For example, a character with a “Great” (20+) rank
in Competence → Expertise → Wizardry could elevate
a common spell to legendary potency.

As an example, the Arcane Maelstrom spell (d6—
Rare—Harm) creates an arcane vortex that deals
damage equal to the caster’s ability roll within its
radius. A mastery die doubles the radius, and failure
results in half-threat damage to all targets. With a
Great (20+) rank, the caster can enhance the spell to
bypass physical defenses and directly strike targets’
essence by succeeding on a d12 challenge roll,
spending 12 Spirit Points, and using a mastery die.
On failure, the spell reverts to standard damage,
which is subject to normal defenses.

84


Spell Failure

The penalty in the table applies if the ability test roll
fails                             when the magic-wielder attempts to cast a
spell. This does not apply to class-based chosen path
spells. Note that using the mastery die with non-
path spells does not negate the risk of spell failure as
outlined in the Spell Failure Table.

Those magic-wielders lacking the Gift of Magic
also                         suffer threat points equal to the result of the
failed roll immediately affecting their passive
defense pool.

Spell Failure Table

Spell Rarity   Reattempt Consequence

D0 (Auto Harm) N/A      None

D4 (Common)  Next Round Spell Fizzles

D6 (Uncommon) 2 rounds   -1 spirit point

D8 (Esoteric)   3 rounds   -3 spirit points
D10                         (Occult)    4 rounds   -4 spirit points

D12 (Legendary) 5 rounds   -5 spirit points

Concentration Check

When a magic-wielder is attacked or otherwise
disrupted                             while maintaining a spell, they must make
a concentration check to avoid losing the spell. The
concentration check is a Competence → Expertise
(Wizardry or Theurgy) roll against a target number
set by the GM, usually based on the severity of the
disruption.

Magic Use Scenarios

Scenario 1: Mage's Defense Negation

Dannumara, a seasoned mage, faced off against
Eldric,                                  a legendary warrior who had stolen a
powerful magical scroll. Eldric’s exceptional speed
(d12; battle phase 1) allowed him to act first. Despite
lacking the Gift of Magic, Eldric attempted to cast an
Arcane Maelstrom spell from a stolen scroll. Eldric
rolled his Competence (d8) and general Expertise
(d6; conceptualized as occult knowledge but lacking
Gift of Magic), and added his Iconic Weapon bonus
(+2). His total roll was 11 (5 on d8, 4 on d6, +2 bonus)
against the spell’s formidable d12 challenge. His
total roll was 9, and the attempt failed. The residual
magical energy still streaked across the battlefield
and manifested as a weaker bolt of harmful mana (as
per Persistence of Magic Energy rules), but
Dannumara, prepared for such an eventuality, waved
it away with a short incantation (i.e., the player
creatively described how she used her Active Defense
to absorb the impact). Eldric’s failure and lack of
magical prowess caused a severe backlash; he lost
Spirit Points equal to the spell’s challenge die (12)
and suffered 12 points of psychic damage directly to
his Passive Defense, reducing him to 8 HP. He gasped
and dropped his weapon.

Seizing the moment, Dannumara retaliated with a
Fire                               Bolt spell. She rolled her Competence (d10),
Expertise (d10), added her Wizardry Focus (+3), and
included her Mastery Die (d8), achieving an
impressive roll totaling 24 threat points (7 on d10, 8
on d10, +3 focus, 6 on d8). Given that her minimum
possible roll exceeded the maximum of the challenge
die (d4), the challenge roll was omitted. Thus, a bolt
of fire erupted from Dannumara’s fingertip, striking
with overwhelming force, depleting her foe’s
remaining hit points, driving his Passive score far
into the negative, and blasting the life out of his
body.

85


MAGIC


Scenario 2: Sorcerer's Multi-Eflect Spell

In the heart of a dense, primeval forest, Aric found
himself                        surrounded by bandits. Though a third-level
mage, he had Deluge from the Elementalism Path—a
powerful control spell.

With a quick incantation, Aric channeled his Spirit
Points                             and summoned a downpour. His casting roll
of 24, boosted by his Elementalism Focus (+3) and
Mastery Die (d8), easily surpassed the challenge roll
of 15. Water surged into the clearing, covering a 20-
foot radius and turning the ground into a swamp.

The bandits, caught in the sudden flood, struggled
to                               move as the water rose to knee level. Their speed
was halved, and their footing faltered in the muck. As
the floodwaters surged through the clearing, the
Bandit Leader struggled to stay upright, caught off
guard by the sudden torrent. Desperately, he
attempted a saving throw, rolling a d6. The result
was a 3—far too low to resist the overwhelming force
of the flood. Swept off his feet, he was dragged into
the swirling water, leaving him and his men
disoriented and vulnerable.

Aric, unscathed, stood ready as the battlefield
shifted                          to his advantage, the bandits slowed and
vulnerable in the flooded terrain.

Integrating Spell Aspects into Active Defense
Players                           may describe their character’s
defensive actions using elements of their

known spells as long as these actions primarily

use Active Defense Points and fit within the
character's                          abilities and the context of the
situation. Magic Defense provided by the Tier 2
Gift of Magic remains a distinct ability
specifically for non-physical magical harm
and should not be confused with general Active
Defense actions (see Gift of Magic, page 22).

Scenario 3: Mystic's Feat-Enhanced Spell

In the ruins of an ancient temple, Seraphina, a
powerful                            mystic, prepared to face the Guardian
Spirit. To ensure the flawless execution of her Mystic
Bolt spell, she utilized her Path Mastery (Mysticism)
feat, eliminating the chance of serious consequence
to spell failure.

Seraphina's rolls were exceptional: Competence
(d12)                             yielded 11, Expertise (d10) resulted in 8, her
Mysticism Focus added +4, and her Mastery Die
(d10) contributed 9. This impressive total of 32 far
surpassed the spell's d8 challenge die, guaranteeing
its success.

The Mystic Bolt, a surge of pure psychic energy,
hurtled                           towards the Guardian Spirit. The spirit's
attempts to defend itself proved futile as the bolt,
being psychic in nature, bypassed its defenses
entirely. The spell inflicted a devastating 32 points of
damage directly to the spirit's Hit Points, leaving it
severely weakened.

The Guardian Spirit, though injured, retaliated with
its                           spectral touch attack, rolling a total of 7 on 2d6.

Seraphina, harnessing the mystical energies
surrounding                             her, utilized her Active Defense,
fortified by elements of her known spells, to conjure
a shimmering barrier. The barrier's strength was
more than enough to absorb the 7 points of damage
from the spirit's attack.

Pressing her advantage, Seraphina cast another
Mystic                             Bolt on her next turn. Her roll of 28 once
again guaranteed the spell's success. The 28 points
of damage overwhelmed the Guardian Spirit's
remaining Hit Points, causing it to dissipate with an
otherworldly wail.

Varieties of Magical
Manifestation

Eldritch RPG spells can take physical or non-
physical                             forms. The default form is physical and
visible, often appearing as a glowing substance.
However, some spells may manifest as telekinetic or
psychic energy, invisible to the naked eye. To
effectively guide their magic-using characters,
players must recognize these different
manifestations.

Non-Physical Harm

Some spells, traps, and damage spells from the
Intangible                           Threats feat inflict non-physical harm.
Normal weapons, shields, or armor can't block it.
However, if the magical attack can be seen or sensed,
it can be dodged with active defense. Magical
protections against preternatural and supernatural
threats, along with enchanted equipment, are
effective against non-physical harm.

Employing feats and spells that bypass defenses,
such                              as ignoring armor, draining spirit points, or
affecting defense pools, does not require a mastery
die. Bypassing Active Defenses or using afflictions
that strip a target of agency, such as mind control,
requires expending one daily mastery die.

Intense Manifestations

Certain spells can manifest with intense physical
power,                          like superheated energy, bypassing armor
and other standard defenses. These powerful
manifestations require the caster to overcome a
higher challenge die and expend additional
resources, like Spirit Points and Mastery Dice.

For example, a Fire Bolt spell can be cast in a
superheated form to melt through armor, ignoring
its damage reduction. To achieve this, the caster
must roll against a higher challenge die and spend
additional Spirit Points if the spell's description
permits such a modification.

Persistence of Magical Energy

When a spell fails, residual energy reverts to a basic,
visible                            form, usually a glowing substance. The spell's
enhancements are lost, leaving only the base
damage. Area-effect spells become single-target
eldritch bolts. Non-harmful or multi-effect spells
fizzle with no lingering effect. Unless it's a class path
spell, consult the full spell failure table. The caster
can suppress the residual effect, but invoking magic
always leaves a trace.

Multi-Effect Spells

Multi-effect spells incorporate several effects, such
as                            Activate, Afflict, Harm, Modify, Protect, and
Restore. The spell’s final challenge rating is based on
the highest die rank of all included effects,
considering their rarity. Multi-effect spells also
require the use of spirit points (as listed for the
spell), making them more challenging to cast than a
single-effect spell.

87


MAGIC


Multi-Effect Spells and Defense
Negation

Non-physical harm, caused by certain spells,
magical                              traps, and harm spells linked with the
Intangible Threats mage feat, bypasses conventional
defenses. Normal weapons and armor are useless
against it, but active defense can dodge it if the
attack is perceivable. Magical protections and
enchanted equipment work against non-physical
harm.

To directly negate defenses like armor or drain
spirit                           points, you need to use a mastery die and
spend extra spirit points. The mastery die roll
represents your willpower, and the spirit point cost
depends on the defense's strength.

Multi-Effect and Spirit Points

In casting multi-effect spells, players have two
options:

Standard Casting: The caster can roll against the
challenge                              die for the primary effect of the spell. For
each additional effect beyond the primary, the caster
pays one spirit point per die-rank step (with a
minimum of 1 spirit point for each extra effect).

Quickening: Alternatively, the caster can use
Quickening                              for rapid casting of the spell. When using
Quickening, the spirit point cost equals the
maximum challenge die rank value of the primary
effect plus 1 spirit point per additional effect.

Quickening accelerates the casting of spells,
forgoing                               the ability test required for spell activation,
but still requires mages to perform challenge checks
for specific enhancements or modifications made
through Dweomers and Arcane Finesse. These feats,
unique to mages, often involve spell alterations
affecting casting modifiers such as bypassing
defense or increasing harm, rather than the spell's
core effects. Failure in these challenge checks, or
insufficient spirit points, leads to backlash,
converting spirit points into potential harm.

Effect Failure and Consequences

If a multi-effect spell’s primary effect fails, all
additional                            effects fail. When any additional effects
fail, consequences depend on the spell’s highest
challenge rating. Players should consult the spell
failure table for guidance.

88


The Paths of Magic

Magic is a vast and complex field whose practitioners
can                                be divided into two main groups: mages and
theurgists. Mages have a deep understanding of
preternatural and magical energies that allow them
to control elemental forces, summon creatures, and
manipulate space and time. Theurgists draw their
power from the gods and use it to manipulate the
natural world around them. Mystics, on the other
hand, manipulate mental and spiritual energies to
stretch the fabric of reality. The paths of magic are as
follows:

Elementalism (mage): Elementalists have learned
how                                 to control the world’s material foundations and
forces. They harness the power of Air, which includes
wind and lightning; Earth, such as minerals, rocks,
and crystals; Fire, including heat, flame, and light;
Water, with its rain, currents, and waves; and
Energy, which encompasses force, spirit, and the
quintessence of power.

Druidry (theurgist): Druids’ spiritual communion
with                             nature grants them theurgical powers over the
world of nature, encompassing plants, animals, and
the physical world. Their connection extends to all
living things beneath intelligent races and intersects
with the chaos of weather patterns.

Hieraticism (theurgist): Priests draw upon their
devotion                              to the gods to channel the forces of life or
entropy, where dreams, matter, and mind intersect.
Priests of Light channel spiritual powers that
quicken matter and sustain life, while Priests of
Darkness spread death, decay, and advocate for the
breakdown of systems.

Mysticism (Mystic): Mystics are masters of the
mind,                           controlling light and shadow, and operating at
the intersection of chaos, magic, and order. They
excel in manipulating mental and spiritual energies
and delving into the fabric of reality.

Sorcery (mage): Practitioners of sorcery deal in
chaos,                                the phantasmagorical, and extra-dimensional
realms. They manipulate thoughts, images,

89

sensations, dimensions, space, time, planes, and
magical                           travel. Sorcerers are adept at reality settling
or unsettling, disorder, luck, and randomness.

Thaumaturgy (mage): Thaumaturges bend reality
and                               can alter matter and time, challenging cosmic
order to affect their surroundings and fates. They are
skilled in manipulating primal forces, using
telekinetic and reality-warping abilities to attain
their wishes.

The Six Magic Effects

The Magic Effects are the backbone of magic in
Eldritch RPG. Each path utilizes these effects in
unique ways.

Activate: This effect serves as the catalyst for
magical                              events. It covers a broad spectrum from
summoning creatures and teleporting objects to
creating and manipulating energies, and even setting
up contingent magic like traps and wards.

Afflict: These spells directly impact a target's
physical                               or mental state, often requiring saving
throws to resist. Mental afflictions disrupt thoughts
and emotions, while physical afflictions hinder
movement and capabilities.

Harm: These spells inflict direct damage in the form
of                            Threat Points. They can range from elemental
attacks like fire and ice to arcane energy blasts and
psychic assaults.

Modify: Spells in this category alter the properties of
creatures, objects, or the environment. They can
enhance or hinder abilities, manipulate senses, or
even transmute one substance into another.

Protect: This effect focuses on bolstering defenses
and                       mitigating damage. It encompasses magical
barriers, armor enhancement, and immunities to
specific types of harm.

Restore/Destroy: This effect category embodies the
duality of creation and destruction. It includes spells
that heal, cure diseases, or even restore life, as well
as those that inflict debilitating conditions,
accelerate decay, or obliterate matter.

Spells for All Paths

Those with the Gift of Magic possess an innate
understanding                              of spells not tied to a specific path.
These spells, while accessible to all with the Gift, are
distinct from Path Spells. Path Spells are unique to a
specific magical path, offering specialized abilities
and effects. In contrast, these general spells are more
foundational, providing a baseline of magical
capability for any magic-wielder.

Dispel Effect: d4—Common—Activate
Description: Often used to dispel magical barriers
such                                      as shields, walls and armor, this spell has many
variations, one version per magic path and per effect
(Afflict, Modify, etc.) dispelled. Dispel Effect cannot

undo or reverse instant spells like Fire Bolt. The effect
dispelled must be in the same path or the dispel won’t
work, which may require identification first.

After beating the challenge die with a single roll of
the                                dice involved with the character’s ability test, that
same roll is used to check against any subsequent
opposing die roll challenges based on the other
caster’s spell rarity (or the rarity of a magic item or
trap’s effect): Common d4; Uncommon d6; Esoteric
d8; Occult d10; Legendary d12.

Game Master Advice: The Game Master can make up
the                             original rarity of the spell that generated
something that can be dispelled on the spot if desired,
have it written down in advance, or refer to an NPC’s
abilities. The Game Master would then roll the
challenge die to dispel the targeted magical effect
inhibiting the player characters’ progress. The player
character may have a chance to figure out the original
rarity of the spell through game play.

97

Identify Magic: d4—Common—Activate
Description: Can detect and identify magic
emanations.                                      The magic-user rolls Competence →
Expertise to detect local magic. A roll above 2 detects
magic emanations if present somewhere nearby. A roll
above 4 detects the general strength and direction of
magic emanations (weak or strong, near or far).

A result of 8 reveals the precise strength and
location                                 of magic effects. A result of 10 also identifies
the path associated with the effect, and a roll above 12
also detects magic type (effect). Rolling above 14 also
identifies a specific magic-wielder spell signature
(even if that caster is unknown), and above 20 also
detects triggers on contingency spells and traps with
magic detection shielding.

Eldritch Bolt: Auto (Variable)— Common—Harm
Description: [Instant / Creature] A bolt of eldritch
energy                                that can take myriad forms, depending on the
type of magic used. This fundamental attack spell is
inherent to all magic-wielders, and they can choose to
enhance its potency by incorporating their mastery
die into the casting. It manifests as a 1 ft-diameter
bolt, delivering immediate potential harm.

For example:

• Druidry: Coalescing, swirling thorny roots and earth
form                                 an orb of natural energy, entwining with vines
and branches to create an organic shell that rolls
forward with an earthy rumble.

• Elementalism: A globular bolt of blazing fire,
crackling                          electricity, freezing ice, solid earth, or
coruscating energy hurtles towards its target, infused
with elemental power.

• Hieraticism: A radiant sphere of holy light, radiating
divine                         brilliance, is accompanied by a low, humming
sound as it swiftly streaks to its destination.

• Mysticism: A swirling orb of telekinetic force,
pulsating                             with power, defies gravity and pulls nearby


GRIMOIRE

objects into its chaotic field of debris as it dashes
towards its mark.

• Sorcery: A dark, swirling sphere of malevolent
energy,                          surrounded by an aura of shadows and
crackling with suppressed power, leaves an eerie trail
as it flies.

• Thaumaturgy: An unpredictable sphere of energy
zigzags                           forward, warping reality with erratic
movements, distorting the surroundings and
accompanied by dissonant echoing sounds.


Eldritch Defense: d4 - Common - Protect
Description: The caster creates a protective barrier or
armor around themselves or a chosen target. The
form                                  of this defense depends on the caster’s magical
path, providing either enhanced armor or magical
shielding that reduces threat points from incoming
attacks. The spell can be customized by each caster's
magic path and grows more potent with higher ranks
of proficiency.

Armor: Adds a layer of magical protection to the
target,                        providing an additional defense pool (in DR
points).

Shielding: Reduces incoming threat points before they
affect                                 the target’s defenses.

Potential Effects:

Armor: Provides DR (damage reduction) equal to the
Challenge Die rank. For example, a d4 version
provides +1 DR, d6 adds +2 DR, and so on, up to a
maximum of +4 DR at d10.

Shielding: Reduces threat points from incoming
attacks                                 by the Challenge Die rank. A d4 Eldritch Shield
reduces threat by 1, d6 by 2, d8 by 3, and d10 by 4.

Maintenance: The spell can be maintained by the
caster,                               but they take a cumulative –1 penalty to other
actions per additional round it is sustained.

Customization by Path:

Elementalism: The shield manifests as a barrier of the
chosen element (e.g., a wall of flame, swirling air, or a
hard shell of earth).

Druidry: Natural elements like vines, bark, or stones
form                              a protective layer around the target.

Hieraticism: The shield takes the form of radiant
divine                             energy, glowing with the light of a deity or holy
power.

Mysticism: The defense is a psychic or telekinetic
force                             field that repels attacks and shields the mind.
Sorcery: The protection is a swirling shadow or dark

energy, deflecting attacks or weakening them before

they hit.

Thaumaturgy: A chaotic and shimmering distortion in
space, warping reality around the target to absorb and
deflect attacks.

Spirit Point (SP) Cost:

Each casting requires 1 SP for every rank of the
Challenge                              Die. So, a d4 costs 1 SP, a d6 costs 2 SP, and
so on, up to 5 SP for a d12.

ELEMENTALISM

Offense Spells

Elemental Assault: d4-d12—Variable—Harm
Description: Elementalists use Elemental Bolt as their
base offensive spell, choosing an elemental
manifestation (Fire, Water, Air, Earth, or Energy).

This spell can be modified and enhanced using the
following options:

Range and Dimensions

Maximum Range: Calculated as (Competence →
Expertise MV) × 4 feet.

Eldritch Bolt: A 1-foot diameter bolt that strikes a
single target.

Eldritch Stream: A continuous stream of energy with a
width of 2 feet and a length equal to (Competence →
Expertise MV) × 4 feet.

Eldritch Burst: An area-of-effect attack with a radius
of                               (2 × Competence → Expertise MV) + Wizardry
bonuses in feet.

Challenge Die and Threat Point Increase: To increase
the                              threat points of the spell, the caster can introduce
a challenge die. The initial increase is always to a d4
challenge die, which adds +1 to the threat points. Each
subsequent increase in the challenge die (d6, d8, d10,
d12) raises the threat points by an additional +1. For
example, a d6 challenge die adds +2 to the threat
points, a d8 adds +3, and so on.

Stream: Increases the Challenge Die by one step (e.g.,
d4                               to d6) and requires an ongoing maintenance
penalty of –1 per additional round.

Burst: Converts the spell to affect an area, increasing
the                         Challenge Die (e.g., d4 to d8).

• Afflictions: Elementalists can add one affliction to
the                             attack, which immediately affects the target. Each

affliction increases the Challenge Die and costs
additional Spirit Points.

Afflictions

Slow (Challenge d4): This affliction can manifest as a
chilling frost enveloping the target, numbing their
limbs; fiery heat distorting the air, causing
disorientation; electrical currents interfering with the
nervous system; earthen weight pulling at the body;
or arcane energy disrupting the target's connection to
time. Regardless of the elemental manifestation, the
effect reduces their initiative by one battle phase
(effectively reducing the basic Prowess rank by one
full step, for example, from d10 to d8). Increase the
difficulty of the magic-wielder's test by +1 when
slowing the target two battle phases, +2 for three
battle phases, and so on. A victim can be dropped
down to below a d2 basic Prowess, with movement
reduced accordingly. This affliction, when caused by
an instant spell, typically lasts for one round unless
the specific spell description states otherwise.

Knock Prone or Knock Back (Challenge d6): This
effect                            might appear as a powerful gust of wind
sweeping the target off their feet, a surge of water

All paths of magic share a foundational approach to
their basic magical attack forms through the use of
specialized bolt spells unique to each discipline.

Whether it’s the Thaumaturge’s Eldritch Bolt, the
Mystic’s                              Mystic Bolt, the Hieraticist’s Divine Bolt, or
the Druid’s Nature Bolt.

Each align with the thematic essence of each magical
tradition,                           manifesting in forms that reflect their
distinct elemental or divine affinities. Despite their
varied appearances and specific elemental attributes,
all bolt spells adhere to core mechanics, such as
having a maximum range calculated by the caster’s
Competence → Expertise MV multiplied by four feet
and delivering potential harm based on the caster’s
Expertise roll plus a predefined modifier.

GRIMOIRE


crashing into them, a tremor in the earth unbalancing
them,                                 a burst of flame creating an explosive force, or a
pulse of arcane energy pushing against them. The
target must make a Skillful saving throw. On a failed
save, the target is knocked prone or knocked back,
depending on the spell or feat used. For spells,
knockback distance is determined by the caster's
Willpower die rank in feet, reflecting their control
over magical energy (e.g., 1d8 feet for a d8 Willpower).
For feats, knockback may be based on the attacker's
Strength die rank. A successful save avoids the effect.
Knockback may trigger opportunity attacks if the
target ends within another creature's reach. As an
instant effect, the knockback or prone condition is
typically resolved immediately, with the target able to
stand or move normally on their next turn unless
otherwise specified.

Stun (Challenge d8): The stunning effect could be
caused                                 by a sudden burst of lightning short-circuiting
the target's senses, a concussive blast of air pressure
disorienting them, searing heat causing momentary
shock to their system, a crushing force of earth energy
overwhelming them, or a flash of pure magical energy
overloading their mind. Regardless of the cause, the
target may not move or attack for one full round. It is
considered temporarily incapacitated and may be
more vulnerable to certain effects or attacks. When
caused by an instant spell, this stun effect typically
lasts for one round unless the specific spell
description indicates a longer duration.

Debilitate Sense (Challenge d10): This affliction
severely                         compromises or overloads a target's sensory
perception. Most Competence → Perception checks
using the affected sense automatically fail, with
possible –5 penalty for compensation attempts. It
significantly impairs environmental interaction and
threat detection. Attacks by affected characters suffer
a -4 penalty to potential harm, reducing threat points
generated. For those with a d4 in the relevant ability,
this often results in minimal or no threat points.

Instant spell effects typically last one round unless
specified otherwise.

Defense Spells

Elementalists harness the fundamental forces of
nature                            through Elemental Shield and Elemental
Armor, crafting defenses that are both versatile and
tailored to the specific threats they face. These spells
draw upon the natural elements—Air, Earth, Fire,
Water, and Energy—to provide robust protection,
adapting dynamically to the ebb and flow of combat.

Elemental Shield: (d4 to d12 — Common to
Legendary — Protect)

Description: The Elementalist conjures a barrier
infused                             with elemental energy, providing protection
tailored to specific threats. Each elemental variant
offers unique defensive properties:

Air Shield: Deflects projectiles and neutralizes energy
attacks;                                may also push attackers back.

Earth Shield: Forms a solid barrier of rock or crystal,
offering                               extra resistance against physical damage.

Fire Shield: Burns away physical attacks, potentially
igniting                         melee attackers.

Water Shield: Absorbs impacts, reducing physical and
energy damage; may unbalance attackers.

Energy Shield: A shimmering barrier that provides
ongoing                          damage reduction, even when active defense
is depleted.

Effect: Reduces incoming threat points by -1 per die
rank (e.g., d4 reduces by 1, d6 by 2).

Spirit Point (SP) Cost: 1 SP per die rank (e.g., d4 costs 1
SP, d6 costs 2 SP).

Maintenance: Requires concentration, incurring a -1
penalty per die rank to other actions for each
additional round.

100


Interaction with Physical Shields: Combine threat
reductions                               from both shields, divide by 2, and round
up.

Elemental Armor (d4 to d12 — Common to
Legendary — Protect)

Description: The Elementalist summons Elemental
Armor                             to envelop the target, fortifying them after
active defenses are breached. This armor adapts to
mitigate various forms of harm based on the chosen
element:

Air Armor: Enhances agility and evasion; increases
movement speed by 10%.

Earth Armor: Hardens like rock, absorbing physical
damage.

Fire Armor: Encases the target in flames; reflects
melee                           damage and grants immunity to non-magical
fire.

Water Armor: Absorbs impacts; grants partial fire
resistance and underwater breathing.

Energy Armor: Infuses resilience against physical and
magical attacks.

Effect: Provides Damage Reduction (DR) equal to the
Challenge Die rank (e.g., roll d4 for DR if using d4).
Spirit Point (SP) Cost: 1 SP per die rank (e.g., d4 costs

1 SP, d6 costs 2 SP).

Maintenance: Requires concentration, with a penalty
of                                -1 per die rank to other actions for each additional
round.

Interaction with Physical Armor: Use the higher DR
between Elemental Armor and physical armor. If
Elemental Armor's DR is lower, add +1 per rank of the
armor spell to the physical DR.

Elemental Barrier (d4 to d12—Common to
Legendary—Protect):

Description: The Elementalist conjures a Barrier
formed                             from elemental forces, providing tailored

defense for groups or strategic battlefield control.
Each                        element adapts to offer unique protective
properties:

Air: Deflects projectiles, neutralizes energy attacks,
and                            may push attackers back.

Earth: Forms a solid wall that absorbs melee and
physical damage.

Fire: Burns physical attackers, potentially igniting
them.

Water: Absorbs impacts, disperses blows, and may
knock attackers back.

Energy: Provides ongoing damage reduction even
when active defense is depleted.

Elemental Walls: Extend protection to cover groups,
providing total or partial cover. Walls impose -4
threat point reductions to ranged attacks passing
through them. Crossing through may inflict direct
harm based on the element.

Area and Dimensions: Base length equals caster’s
Ability                             Branch Maximum Value (MV) × 2 feet, height 5
feet. Shape adjustable at casting, with thickness
scaling with Challenge Die (up to 5 feet at d12).

Modifiers: Knockback for Air and Water walls;
Additional                       Resistance for Earth and Energy walls to
further reduce damage.

Common

Air Bubble: d4—Common—Activate

Description: [M / Self, Creature, or Area] Traps air to
allow                            breathing under water. Creates a small bubble of
breathable air around the caster’s or a companion’s
head. As the bubble is gas-permeable, this does not
block poisons. Casting Modifiers: self or one creature is
challenge die d4; +1 added to challenge die per
additional creature affected; creating a large
breathable bubble is an area effect, adding +4 to
challenge die.

GRIMOIRE


Ball of Light: d4—Common—Activate

Description: [M / Area] Creates a ball of light that
illuminates                              an area. The ball of light will bob in the air
following the mage or attached to an item. It is not
harmful but can light up a large area (up to the ability
branch MV ×2 in radius in feet) as if it were a steady
lantern. The elementalist can adjust the radius of the
light.

Boil Water: d4—Common—Activate

Description: [M / Area] The spell simply heats water to
the boiling point. Water vapor is not manipulatable
until cooled. Area of effect is up to 2 × basic die rank in
height, width, and depth in feet. Creatures standing in
affected water suffer no threat points for the first
round, but the temperature rises noticeably. Increase
by 1 point for every round after that to the MV of the
caster’s Competence die rank (1 threat point on 2nd
round, 2 on 3rd, etc.). The maintenance penalty is –1
until maximum threat points are reached, then it
increases by 1 per round

Breeze: d4—Common—Activate

Description: [M / Area] The caster summons a light
breeze in the desired direction that can be used for
various purposes. The breeze can be used to whisk
away small objects, clear away debris, or disperse
smoke or gas. Elementalists can also use magical
breezes for misdirection, annoyance, and mischief.

Charge of the Elements: d4—Common—Modify
Description: [M / Self] The caster channels energy into
himself, temporarily increasing his physical abilities.
The caster gains a +1 bonus to any Agility or Strength
specialty                         checks or rolls. Casting Modifiers: increase
the challenge die by one step to increase the bonus to

+2.

Cleanse Air: d4—Common—Activate

Description: [Inst / Area] Remove airborne poisons,
smoke,                                etc. The GM will assign a difficulty based on the
air quality. Basic pollen or smog, easy (challenge die
d4). Clearing the air in a burning building or room,
extreme (challenge die d16). Clearing airborne toxins
should always be at least a difficult challenge
(challenge die d8). Area cleared equals branch MV
radius in feet.

Crystal Vision: d4—Common—Activate
Description: [M / Self] The caster gains the ability to
see                              through any crystalline minerals, whether
translucent or opaque, up to the ability branch MV in
feet, allowing them to see hidden objects or creatures
within them.

Drown: Auto—Common—Harm

Description: [M / Creature] Slowly increase the
amount                                  of water in someone’s lungs. Does no threat
points for 2 rounds as the lungs begin to fill, but after
that, the spell inflicts 1 threat point per round to
passive defense (or a magic active defense if the target
has one) until the target perishes or the spell is
interrupted.

Energy Jump: d4—Common—Activate
Description: [M / Self] The caster channels energy
into                                      his or her legs, allowing them to jump a distance
up to the ability branch MV in feet. The caster can
jump over obstacles or onto higher platforms, but
must land on a solid surface. Casting Modifiers:
increase the challenge die by +1 for every additional 5
feet in jump distance

Energy Pulse: d4—Common—Activate
Description: [M / Area] Sends out a wave of magical
energy                                    in a radius equal to the caster’s ability branch
MV ×2. This pulse is specifically designed to interact

102


with mechanical devices within its area of effect. It
can                            activate or disrupt their function at the behest of
the caster, rolling against a difficulty of d4 for each
device.

Extinguish Flames: d4—Common—Activate
Description: [Inst / Area variant] As the name implies,
this                                     is the ability to get rid of an existing fire. Flames
are snuffed out instantly upon a successful roll. The
caster rolls only once, but each flame source gets a
separate saving throw based on its size. Candles would
be easy (d4) to extinguish; a burning house or area of
a forest fire would be extreme (2d12). The area of
effect (ability branch MV ×2 radius in feet, doubled for
mastery) is approximate and flexible — the caster can
choose which flames to affect, so long as the flames
are in the line of sight.

Fire Strike: d4—Common—Harm

Description: [M / Creature] This spell allows the
caster                                  to manipulate existing fire to move or attack.
The mage can use an existing fire source and alter its
form to move like a living thing. The fire requires fuel
from a nearby source and can be used to inflict
physical harm. Unlike Fire Bolt, Fire Strike is
maintainable and allows the caster to get one strike
per round. The caster can either use the original dice
roll as potential harm or reroll each round to
determine the potential harm without an additional
ability test. The distance at which the mage can
control the fire is his or her basic Competence die rank
MV in feet, up to 10 × that with mastery. Casting
Modifiers: +4 to challenge die to spread the fire in
front of foes, acting as a barrier to block movement.

The fire inflicts damage equal to the caster’s ability

roll +1. When a target walks through the fire willfully,
it                               does not benefit from active defense, but shields
and armor still apply. If a target charges through the

fire, it takes half damage, and shields and armor apply
as                            normal.

Fire Trail: d4—Common—Modify

Description: [M / Area] The caster creates a trail of
flames                             behind him or her as he or she moves, igniting
flammable objects in the trail. The trail has a length of
up to the caster’s basic Competence die rank
multiplied by 10 feet. Creatures that move through the
trail take damage equal to the caster’s basic
Competence die rank of fire threat points +1.

Flame Creature: d4—Common—Activate
Description: [M / Creature] Creates a critter of flame
to                                       do the caster’s bidding. This spell animates a flame
creature from an existing flame, so it gets no saving
throw to break the spell. The flame creature is non-
intelligent but will attack enemy targets
autonomously each round, doing caster’s basic
Competence die rank fire threat points. Casting
Modifiers: +2 to challenge die per extra threat point,
up to a maximum of the caster’s Competence rank.
(Creature hit points = the caster’s basic Competence
MV.) Flame Creature Type: Minor Threat Dice: Melee
d4 (Fiery Strikes) + possible bonus from the caster's
Competence as per the spell description Hit Points: 4
(2/2) [Regular, Small, Mundane] Damage Reduction:

103


GRIMOIRE


None Saving Throw: d4 Battle Phase: 4 (d6) Notes: A
creature of animated flame, bound to the caster's will.
Non-intelligent but will attack designated targets
each round. Can be extinguished by water or
smothering effects.

Flame Fists: d4—Common—Harm

Description: [M / Creature] Adds fire threat points to
recipient’s unarmed attacks. The recipient’s fists
develop a hot glow: add +1 to every unarmed strike.

Flame Weapon: d4 (Variable)—Common—Activate
Description: [M / Self, Creature] The weapon wielded
by                              the caster or another designated creature ignites,
adding bonus fire threat points. The weapon acts as a
normal weapon, wieldable using the Melee branch.

The spell adds a base of +1 to the weapon's threat
points.                               The caster can increase this bonus by +1 for
each increase in the challenge die rank (+2 total at d6,

+3 total at d8, etc.) up to a maximum of +5 at d12. Each

+1 threat point bonus beyond the base +1 costs 1 SP.

Forge From Stone: d4—Common—Activate
Description: [M / Creature] The caster must contact
the                                  earth to cast this spell, which shapes a weapon out
of the earth. He can use this for an instantaneous
attack, or the shape can be maintained in position
from round to round. In either case, it can strike for
ability branch MV potential harm. Add +1 to challenge
die to affect multiple targets (1 per die rolled; splitting
dice rolls, to a maximum of three dice, if including
mastery).

Freeze: d4—Common—Activate

Description: [M / Area] This spell simply freezes
water                                (it does not shape the ice). The area of effect is
up to 2 × basic Competence die rank in height, width,
and depth in feet. Casting Modifiers: attempting to
freeze water fast enough to trap a medium-sized

creature is +10 to the challenge die. Failing a Prowess

→ Agility or Fortitude → Strength → Ferocity or Might
roll                             means the target is stuck, unable to free himself
from the frozen surface, halving active defense, or all
active defense if unlucky enough to be stuck bodily
(50% chance).

Fresh Air: d4—Common—Activate
Description: [M / Area] This spell creates fresh,
breathable air in the form of a bubble. The air

continues to exist once created, and maintenance
prevents                         dissipation. It is useful if one finds oneself
suddenly high in the atmosphere or underwater or
teleported into a dimensional space with no air. If it is
cast in a confined space, it can increase air pressure.
Area effect is the ability branch MV ×2 radius in feet.

Fuel Flames: d4 (Variable)—Common—Harm
Description: [M / Area] Increase a fire’s size and
potential                             harm. Fuel Flames can transform an
ordinary fire into a significant hazard, potentially
blocking paths, creating cover, or forcing enemies to
reposition. By feeding an existing fire with elemental
fuel, the caster can expand the size or height of the
target flames by up to ability branch MV ×2 in feet
(double that if cast with mastery). This gives a fire
threat point bonus of +1 per chosen challenge die
rank: +1 at d4 up to +5 at d12.

Halo of Energy: d4—Common—Protect
Description: [M / Creature] The caster channels
energy                                     into a creature or object, protecting it from
energy attacks. The shield provides DR 1 vs. energy
attacks, and the shielded creature or object gains a +1
bonus to any checks or rolls involving energy. Casting
Modifiers: Increase the challenge die by +1 to increase
the DR to 2.

104


Heat: Auto—Common—Harm

Description: [M-variant / Area] Cause a heatwave to
increase the temperature slowly. The heatwave can
affect an area or item. No threat points for the first
round, but the temperature rises noticeably. Increase
by 1 point for every round after that to the MV of the
caster’s Competence die rank (1 threat point on 2nd
round, 2 on 3rd, etc.) The maintenance penalty is –1
until maximum threat points are reached, then it
increases by 1 per round.

Illuminating Insight: d4—Common—Modify
Description: [M / Self] The caster gains the ability to
perceive energy flows in the surroundings, as his or
her                              eyes emit a faint blue light. With this perception,
the caster can detect concealed energy-based devices
and energy sources, such as elemental electricity. He
or she can also observe any disruptions in energy
flows resulting from magical or technological means.

Luminous Wave: d4—Common—Harm
Description: [M / Area (stream)] The caster releases a
wave                                     of energy that spreads out from them in a
stream shape, dealing potential harm to all creatures
caught in its path (attack roll +1 threat point). The
wave has a width of 2 feet and extends out to a
distance equal to the caster’s ability branch MV × 4.

Creatures hit by the wave can attempt to dodge the
attack                              using their active defense. Unlike many other
harm spells, Luminous Wave is maintainable and
allows the caster to continue releasing waves of
energy each round.

Mineral Analysis: d4—Common—Activate
Description: [M / Object] The caster learns about the
minerals within an object or material. The spell allows
the caster to identify the type and properties of the
minerals                            within the target object. The spell can be

used on objects up to the size of the ability branch MV

×2 in cubic feet.

Kinetic Augmentation: d4 (Variable)—Common—
Modify,                         Afflict

Description: [M / Creature] The caster imbues a
creature                               with a surge of kinetic energy, enhancing its
physical strikes. For the duration of the spell, the
target gains an additional +1 threat point on all melee
attacks. Casting Modifiers: To enhance the recipient’s
power and to inflict the Knock Prone effect on a
successful strike against a foe strike by one
augmented by this spell, increase the challenge die to
d6 and expend 1 Spirit Point.

Rain: d4—Common—Activate

Description: [M / Area Special] Create a heavy rain
shower                               over an area. The thick rainfall causes –1 to
ranged attacks and –1 to Perception rolls. Area
affected is special: 10 feet diameter per die rank MV
possessed in each tier (e.g. Competence d6 & Expertise
d4 would give a 100-foot diameter area of effect).

Resist Elements: d4 (Variable)—Common—Activate
Description: [M / Area] The caster grants resistance to
one                                 or more chosen elements (earth, air, fire, water,
or energy) to those within the spell’s sphere of effect.
This applies to Elementalism Harm spells and to
equivalent natural phenomena (e.g., flames,
blizzards, landslides). Beneficiaries of the spell gain
damage reduction equal to the challenge rank chosen
by the caster (d4 to d12) while the spell is maintained.
Casting Modifier: +1 to the Challenge die for each
element affected, including the first.

Rocky Terrain: d4—Common—Modify
Description: [M / Area] The caster transforms the
ground                            into rocky terrain, making it difficult for
creatures to move through. Any creature that

105


GRIMOIRE


attempts to move through the affected area must roll
Skillful                                Save vs. the caster’s spell strength or become
slowed, moving at half its normal speed. The affected
area is ability branch MV ×2 radius in feet, doubled for
mastery.

Safe Descent: Ranked (Variable ) Common—Protect
Description: [M / Creature or Self] The caster or target
falls                           slowly and safely to the ground, taking no
damage upon landing. This spell can also slow down
the descent of objects or creatures already falling.

Casting modifiers: the challenge die is based on the
size                                 and weight of the target or object, d4 small, d6
medium, d8 large, d10 huge, d12 gargantuan (up to
100, 300, 2500, 25,000, 50,000 pounds weight
respectively). The caster can affect multiple targets or
objects, with each additional target or object adding +1
to the challenge die.

Sense Air Currents: d4 (Variable)— Common—
Activate

Description: [M / Self] The caster senses any
movement                                in the air around him, feeling the air like a
motion detector to read the environment. Add a +1 to

+5 bonus to Perception rolls with an air current or
movement present, or offset penalties due to darkness
or blindness. Bonus points are +1 per chosen challenge
die rank: +1 at d4 up to +5 at d12.

Steal Breath: Auto—Common—Harm
Description: [M-variant / Creature] Remove the air
from                                 the victim’s lungs, causing asphyxiation. No

threat points for the first round, but breath shortens.
Increase                             by 1 point for every round after that to the
MV of the caster’s basic ability (1st tier) die: 1 threat
point on 2nd round, 2 on 3rd, etc. Damage points
inflicted in this way will immediately return if the
spell is canceled, blocked, or otherwise dispelled. The

maintenance penalty is –1 until maximum threat
points                            are reached, then it increases by 1 per round.

Tremor Sense: d4—Common—Activate
Description: [M / Self] The caster can sense vibrations
in                                     the earth, allowing them to detect movement and
locate hidden structures.

Water Breathing: d4—Common—Protect
Description: [M / Creature] The magic-wielder grants
a                                  single target the ability to breathe underwater while
the spell is maintained. If cast as a ritual (see Spell
Ritualization in the Arcanum chapter), it can be for a
duration equal to the ritual time used to generate the
effect. The target can also communicate with aquatic
creatures while under the effects of the spell.

Water Streaming: d4—Common—Activate
Description: [M / Area] Move water from place to
place.                                   This is simply the ability to manipulate small
amounts of water, for example, to drain a pool. The
area of effect is up to 2 × basic Competence die rank in
height, width, and depth in feet.

Water Vortex: d4—Common—Modify

Description: [M / Area] The magic-wielder summons
a                             swirling vortex of water in a designated area,
creating a powerful current that drags creatures or
objects towards the center. Targets caught in the
vortex suffer a -2 penalty to all actions and are unable
to move away from the center unless they make a
successful Valorous Saving throw (Fortitude →
Strength roll). The area of effect is up to 2 × basic
Competence die rank in height, width, and depth in
feet.

Water Ward: d4—Common—Protect
Description: [M / Creature] The magic-wielder
creates                              a shield of water around a single target,

106


granting a +1 bonus to passive defense for the
duration                                 of the spell. The shield can absorb up to the
caster’s ability branch MV in harm with maintenance,
but once it is depleted, the spell ends.

Water Whip: d4—Common—Harm

Description: [M / Creature] The caster creates a whip-
like                             stream of water that lashes out at a single target.
It causes ability branch potential harm +1 and can be
blocked with a shield, avoided with active defense, or
absorbed by armor. The water whip can also be used to
extinguish small fires or soak flammable objects. The
range of the spell is the caster’s ability roll in yards.

Casting Modifiers: +2 added to the challenge die to
attempt                                  to grab and pull a target as well, provided it is
no larger than the caster. A grabbed target must make
a Fortitude → Strength roll against the caster’s
original ability roll to break free.

Zephyr Mind: d4—Common—Activate
Description: [M / Creature] The spell summons a
small                                   wind creature (1 hit point, 0 threat points) that
cannot fight but can be sent to spy for the caster,
deliver messages telepathically, move small objects
with microbursts of air, etc. It can range away from
the caster and communicate, sending messages like
whispers upon the wind, heard only by the caster. In
turn, the caster can speak to the Zephyr Mind, and it

will obey simple commands, e.g., snuffing a candle. It
appears as a turbulent ball of wind, about 3 inches
wide, difficult to see if one is not looking for it: –5 to
any Perception roll to spot it.

Uncommon

Arcane Maelstrom: d6—Rare—Harm
Description: [Inst / Area]: A swirling vortex of raw
arcane energy erupts from the caster's fingertips,
engulfing                             all targets within a radius determined by

doubling the caster's combined Competence and
Expertise                                MV, plus their Wizardry or Theurgy bonus.
Each target suffers damage equal to the caster's
ability test roll. Casting with a mastery die doubles the
maelstrom's radius. Casting Modifier: with a Great
(20+) rank in the Competence → Expertise → Wizardry
branch, the caster can unleash an intensified Arcane
Maelstrom, bypassing active defense points. This
enhanced version costs 5 Spirit Points, requires
success on a d12 challenge roll using a mastery die,
and consumes 1 additional Spirit Point per target
beyond the first. Failure reverts the spell to its normal
form. Both forms are affected by shields and armor,
which mitigate damage. The intensified form glows
ominously, instilling fear in witnesses.

Crystal Enhancement: d6— Uncommon—Modify
Description: [M / Object] The caster can cause crystal
growth                              on a targeted object, such as a weapon or
armor, making it more durable and increasing
effectiveness. The object affected can be up to the
ability branch MV ×2 in cubic feet. The effects of the
spell last until dispelled or the object is destroyed.

Crystalize Earth: d6—Uncommon—Modify
Description: [M / Object] The caster can transform a
portion                                 of the earth, such as soil or sand, into crystal.
The area affected can be up to the ability branch MV

×2 in square feet. The caster can shape and
manipulate                              the crystals, but they are brittle and can
be shattered easily.

Disorienting Gale: d6 (Variable)—Uncommon—

gust,                                 it must make a valorous saving throw (Fortitude

→ Endurance → Vitality or Resilience) against the
threat                           points rolled or be knocked prone. Even if the

107

save is made, creatures lose d4 from active defense for
the                               round.

Energy Drain: d6—Uncommon—Modify
Description: [Inst / Creature] The caster siphons the
energy                               from a single target, draining its stamina and
reducing its ability scores for a short time. The target
suffers a penalty of –2 to all Prowess test rolls for as
long as the spell is maintained.

Energy Leech: d6—Uncommon—Modify
Description: [Inst / Creature] The caster establishes a
magical connection with a single creature within
range.                               When the targeted creature next attacks the
caster, the spell absorbs a portion of the damage,
converting it into a temporary hit point pool for the
caster. The damage absorbed equals 2 points per
separate attack, and the temporary hit points persist
until the spell ends or the points are depleted. This
spell effect can only convert damage not already
blocked or absorbed by other effects. The caster must
have sufficient spirit points to convert the damage
into temporary hit points. Unlike the regular Absorb
sub-effect, this spell doesn't require an extra die-
rank step up, as it only affects one creature's attacks
against the caster.

Energy Surge: d6—Uncommon—Modify
Description: [M / Self] The caster channels a surge of
energy                                into his or her body, temporarily increasing
physical abilities. The caster gains a +2 bonus to any
Prowess ability tests.

Energy Transference: d6—Uncommon—Restore
Description: [M / Creature] The caster transfers
energy                               from himself or herself to another creature,
healing its wounds and restoring its vitality. The
target creature regains a number of hit points equal to
the caster’s ability branch MV ×2.

Fire Whip: d6—Uncommon—Harm

Description: [M / Creature] The caster shapes flames
into                                  a long, flexible whip that lashes out to strike a
target. The whip is 10 feet long and inflicts harm equal
to the caster's roll +2 in threat points. The caster may
use the whip to attack a single target within reach or
to strike multiple targets within the same turn, up to
the number of dice in the Competence → Expertise →
Mastery die combination. For a single attack: The
caster attacks as per the standard rules. For multiple
attacks: Depending on the die combination, the caster
may make up to three separate attacks. The second
attack suffers a -2 penalty to hit; if a third (Mastery)
attack is made, it also suffers a -2 penalty. The
caster's Focus bonus applies to each separate attack if
applicable. This spell allows flexibility in executing
multiple attacks, either making three separate attacks
with penalties to the latter two or combining
Competence and Expertise for one attack and then
making a separate Mastery attack with a -2 penalty.

Fissure: d6—Uncommon—Harm

Description: [M / Area variant] Opens a split in the
ground,                             whether stone or soil. The caster must stand
upon solid earth or a stone floor to cast this spell. The
area of effect is special: fissure width approximately 4
feet, by length ability branch MV ×2 in feet, by depth

the area of effect must roll Agility vs. the caster’s spell
roll or fall into the fissure and take 10 threat points for
every 10 feet fallen. Casting Modifiers: +4 to challenge
die for every additional 10 feet deep and 2 feet wide
(calculated with Mastery when relevant). The hole is
open if it is maintained. Those in the fissure are
expelled without further harm when the spell ends.

Healing Waters: d6—Uncommon— Restore
Description: [M / Creature] The caster summons a
pool                                 of healing water that restores the health of any

108


creature that comes into contact with it. The healing
water                              can be used to heal injuries, cure ailments, and
even revive the dead. The amount of healing provided
is equal to the caster’s ability branch MV.

Heatwave: d6—Uncommon—Modify
Description: [M / Area] The caster creates a sudden
surge                                   of heat in the surrounding area, causing the

temperature to rise dramatically. Any creature within
the                              area of effect must make a successful Fortitude

radius of the caster’s basic Competence die rank

MV in feet.

weapon of ice
materializes in the
hands of the caster.
The ice weapon this
spell creates is used
with either the
Expertise or Melee
branch, whichever is

higher, inflicting ability
branch            +2 threat points of

damage. The weapon can ignore 2

points of shielding or armor. There is a 10% chance
per                           round that the weapon shatters when used for
parrying, inflicting 2 threat points to any creature
within 5 feet (the caster is immune to the flying
shards).

Ignite: d6—Uncommon—Activate

Description: [Inst / Area] The caster ignites a
flammable                              object within range, causing it to burst
into flames. The object's size determines the
challenge die of the spell, ranging from d4 for small
objects such as a piece of paper to d12 for large objects
such as a wooden building. The flames continue to
burn until extinguished or until the object is
consumed.

Rend Walls: d6—Uncommon—Activate

Description: [M / Area-
variant]            The caster
topples or crumbles a
constructed stone
wall in range, width
approximately 4 feet,
by length of up to
ability branch MV ×2
in feet, by height of
up to 10 + ability roll
in feet. The spell
works on artificial

structures made of
separate        stones, not
solid earth or rock.
Still, the structure gets
an item saving throw:

Stone 2d10, Brick 2d8.
Falling            debris near the
origination point may pose

a danger (see GM Section, Hazard Rules).

Stone Shape: d6—Uncommon—Modify

Stone Shatter: d6—Uncommon—Modify, Harm
(1SP)

Description: [M / Object] The caster causes a targeted
stone                               or crystal object to shatter and break apart. The
size of the object affected can be up to the caster’s
ability branch MV ×2 in cubic feet. When the object
shatters, it explodes outward, potentially harming
creatures within a radius of half the object's longest
dimension in feet. For example, if the targeted object
is a statue 6 feet tall, the harm radius is 3 feet.

Creatures within the radius take threat points equal to
half the caster's ability branch MV, rounded down.

Shields, armor, and active defense can be used to
mitigate this harm.

Water Elemental: d6—Uncommon— Activate
Description: [M / Special] The caster summons a
powerful                               water elemental to do his or her bidding. The
elemental has a number of abilities related to water
manipulation, including the ability to summon rain,
create waves, and drown enemies.

Water Illusion: d6—Uncommon—Afflict
Description: [M / Area] The caster creates an illusory
image                                     of himself or another creature out of water that
can distract enemies and cause confusion. The illusion
can move and speak like the real creature but has no
physical substance and can be dispelled with a
successful ability test roll. Targets affected by the
illusion must make a Perception saving throw, and on
a failure, suffer a -2 penalty to all of their Perception
actions.

Water Prison: d6—Uncommon—Modify
Description: [M / Creature] The caster surrounds a
single                                 target with a sphere of water, trapping it within

by supercharged surface tension. The target must
make                                  a successful agility test roll to escape initially or
be imprisoned for the spell’s duration. While trapped,
the target is unable to attack or use magic and suffers
damage as per the Drown spell: no threat points for 2
rounds, then the spell inflicts 1 threat point per round
to passive defense.

Water Walk: d6—Uncommon—Modify
Description: [M / Creature] The caster imbues the
target                              with the ability to walk on water as if it were
solid ground. The target can move across water
without sinking or getting wet.

Windwalk: d6—Uncommon—Activate

Description: [M / Creature or Self] Allows the caster or
target to walk or rest on air, as if it were a solid
surface. The spell can be maintained, and the caster

maintenance penalty of –2 to ability tests while
concentrating on maintaining the spell’s magical
effects. Casting Modifiers: +1 added to the challenge
die per additional creature affected.

Aquatic Summons: d8—Esoteric— Activate

a                               swarm of aquatic creatures to aid in battle, drawing

Crystal Analysis: d8—Esoteric—Activate
Description: [M / Self] The caster can see through
and                               analyze crystal structures, allowing him or her to
detect hidden objects or structures made of crystal.


from native species in the surrounding environment.
Depending                              on the magic-wielder's roll and chosen
difficulty, the type and number of creatures are as
follows: Minor Swarm (d4) summons a school of
small fish or crabs, numbering 2 × the MV of the
challenge die chosen; Standard Swarm (d6) summons
a pack of moderate-threat aquatic beings like sharks
or dolphins, numbering 2 × the MV of the challenge
die chosen; Exceptional Swarm (d10+2) summons a
group of powerful sea creatures like sea serpents or
merfolk, numbering 2 × the MV of the challenge die
chosen.

The creatures act as one group, with Initiative equal
to                                 the caster’s Expertise rank, are instinct-driven,
and follow simple commands. The spell operates like a
regular swarm summoning, attacking as many targets
as it can surround, with damage and control handled
similarly to other swarm spells. Maintenance
penalties apply from the second round, determined by
the original test, and the summoner can command the
swarm to attack in the same round they appear.

Crystal Growth: d8—Esoteric—Modify
Description: [M / Object] Creates crystal obstacles or
barriers from an existing crystal. Can create up to
caster’s ability branch MV ×2 in cubic feet of crystal.
The crystal barrier lasts for a number of hours equal
to the caster’s ability roll before reverting to its
original                                size. The caster can maintain the spell with a
–3 penalty to all other ability tests past the first
round, allowing the crystals to persist indefinitely
until dispelled or destroyed or until his or her
concentration is broken.

Adepts and mages can ritualize the spell, casting it
without maintenance penalties (see Spell
Ritualization in the Arcanum chapter). A focus object
must be used that remains intact during the intended
duration. The ritual time equals the desired duration,
so a one-hour ritual can create a crystal barrier for
one hour.

Crystalize Object: d8—Esoteric—Modify
Description: [M / Object] The caster can transform a
non-living object made of minerals or rock into a
crystalline structure. The object retains its original
shape                                and can still be used as intended, but gains
additional hardness and durability. The object gains
an armor rating of d8 and cannot be easily destroyed
by non-magical means.

Diamond Strike: d8—Esoteric—Harm
Description: [Inst / Self or Creature] The caster
imbues                                    his or a creature's fist with the hardness of

Energy Conversion:

d8—Esoteric— Modify
Description: [M /
Creature] The caster can

absorb and store electricity,

converting it into energy

machines. The caster can
store up to their ability
branch potential in energy.

Energy Beacon: d8—Esoteric—
Activate

Description: [M / Object] Creates a beacon of

light and energy that can be seen from far away. The
caster can control the color and intensity of the
beacon, and it can be used to signal for help or as a

caster’s ability branch MV ×4 in miles.

Energy Infusion: d8—Esoteric—Restore
Description: [Inst / Creature or Object] The caster can
infuse                                    an object or creature with magical energy,
restoring it to its full potential. This can be used to
restore active defense during battle or to recharge a
magic item. The amount of healing or recharging done
is equal to the caster’s ability branch MV.

Energy Leech: d8—Esoteric—Modify

Description: [M / Creature] The caster can drain
the                       energy from a target creature, weakening

it and absorbing the energy for his or her
own use. The target suffers a

penalty of –3 to all actions and
abilities, and the caster gains a
bonus of +3 to his or her own

actions and abilities. Casting
Modifiers: +1 for each
additional point leached —

the penalty and bonus can be
up                   to the caster’s ability branch
potential. The effect lasts for

as long as the caster
maintains     concentration.

Esoteric

Fire Armor: d8—Esoteric—
Harm,           Modify, Protect (3 SP)

Description: [M / Self] Armor of fire

Fire Elemental: d8—Esoteric—Modify

Description: [M / Creature] The caster imbues a fire
source                             with the essence of a fire elemental, creating a

→ Agility → Speed or Reaction) Agility save vs. the
caster’s                              ability roll or become restrained so long as
the spell is maintained. While restrained, the target is
unable to move or take any actions, but can still attack
if within reach. The grasp can be broken by taking
damage equal to the caster’s ability roll or by a
successful Fortitude → Strength check (vs. the
caster’s ability roll).

Ice Shield: d8—Esoteric—Multi-Effect.

Description: [M / Special] The caster summons forth a
protective barrier of thick, jagged ice, crackling with
frost, which surrounds them. This ice shield confers a
damage reduction (DR) value of 3, absorbing threat
points from incoming attacks. However, the shield is
inherently unstable. Each time the shield absorbs
damage equal to or exceeding half the caster's base
Competence die maximum value, there is a 10%
chance it shatters. For example, if the caster’s
Competence is d8, a result of 4 or higher on a d6 roll
indicates the shield shatters. Upon shattering, the
shield explodes in a burst of razor-sharp ice shards.

These shards inflict a number of threat points equal to
the shield's remaining DR value to all creatures within
a radius of 2 feet per level of the caster. The caster is
immune to this effect.

Minor Earthquake: d8—Esoteric—Activate.
Description: [M / Area] Causes a structure-damaging
earth tremor. This spell causes shaking and rumbling

of the ground, damaging structures, but having
negligible                              effect on individuals unless they are caught
by falling debris or lose their balance. Competence
branch MV damage is done to structures in the area of
effect. Falling debris near the origination point may
pose a danger (see GM Section, Hazard Rules). The
earthquake affects an area of ability branch MV ×2
radius in feet, doubled for mastery. Creatures targeted
directly are shaken, falling prone.

Description: [M / Self] The caster can fly by jetting
flame                               from his or her lower limbs. Flames shoot like a
rocket: powerful, loud, and quite visible, so stealth is
not possible. Movement (see Movement in Chapter 3)
is based on the spell ability branch MV rather than
Prowess MV. The flames neither harm the caster nor
are useful as an attack form, but may ignite
combustibles at takeoff and landing.

Purify Water: d8—Esoteric—Restore

Description: [M / Area] The magic-wielder purifies a
target body of water, removing all toxins and
impurities. This allows creatures to drink the water
safely and may also restore the health of aquatic

a                           shimmering shield of quartz-like energy that offers

a                                   target the ability to breathe underwater while the

from drowning and enables free movement in aquatic
settings.

Whirlpool: d8—Esoteric—Modify

a                             powerful vortex of water whose swirling current is
capable of dragging creatures or objects towards its
center. The area of effect is up to 2 × the magic-
wielder’s ability branch die rank in height, width, and
depth in feet. Targets caught in the whirlpool suffer a
–2 penalty to all actions and take damage equal to the

the spell ends. A successful valorous saving throw
(Fortitude → Endurance → Vitality or Resilience) is
required to escape.

Description: [Inst / Creature] Creates a powerful
whirlwind                               that traps the target, lifting it off the
ground and making it vulnerable to attacks. The
swirling winds within the whirlwind batter and
disorient the target, causing a stunning effect that
leaves it dazed and unable to react to the surroundings

energy                                in a radius equal to your ability branch MV ×2,

shockwave ability. If struck more than once in a
round, the golem releases a shockwave that repels all

and magical nature, summoning the golem incurs a -
2 penalty to the ability test, which expending spirit
points can offset. After the first round, the golem
attempts to break free by rolling its highest Threat
Dice (2d8) against the caster's relevant ability branch.

Stone Weapon: d10—Occult—Modify

Description: [M / Special] Creates a bladed weapon of
diamond-hard stone. The glittering weapon created
has +4 threat points. The caster can use any
appropriate weapon skill to wield it, and it may be
used to attack in the round of creation.

GRIMOIRE


Whelm: d10—Occult—Afflict

Description: [M / Area] Waves of water surge at
opponents                             while the spell lasts: they disrupt the area
and may knock over and stun opponents. Those
caught in the waves must roll versus Prowess →
Agility, or Fortitude → Strength, to maintain balance.
Those who fail fall stunned, losing any move or attack
next round.

Whirlwind: d10—Occult—Afflict (1 SP)

Description: [M / Creature or Area] The caster creates
a                              powerful whirlwind that can afflict the targets
within a 10-ft radius circle with a dizzying,
disorienting sensation. Targets affected by this spell
suffer a penalty to their ability tests and have their
initiative reduced by one battle phase. The spell costs 1
spirit point to cast, and an additional 1 spirit point for
each additional round the spell is maintained. Casting
Modifiers: +1 per 2 ft increase in radius of area of
effect.

Wind Rush: d10—Occult—Afflict

Description: [M / Area] A massive gust of air that can
knock over large objects. A very potent version of the
Breeze spell. The area affected is a steadily widening
stream from the caster to a circle of basic tier MV in
feet. Opponents must make a skillful saving throw
(Prowess → Agility → Speed or Reaction) vs. the
caster’s ability roll or be knocked over and spend the
next round getting up.

Legendary

Crystal Fortress: d12—Occult—Protect
Description: [M / Area] The caster creates a fortress
made                                      of crystal that provides cover and protection for
allies. The fortress can be up to the ability branch MV

×2 in feet height, and its length in feet is equal to twice
the                             ability branch MV ×2. The fortress has an armor

rating of d12 and can absorb harm directed at those
inside                                it. The fortress lasts until dispelled or
destroyed.

Earth Merge: d12—Legendary—Protect
Description: [M / Self] Bestows the ability to pass
through earth and stone. The caster moves more
slowly (half normal movement, no sprinting) and
leaves no tunnel. There is some danger of
disorientation in large bodies of rock (GM’s call).

Elemental Form: d12+2—Legendary—Modify,
Harm,                      Protect (SP 5)

Description: [M / Creature] The caster transforms into
a                               being of pure elemental energy, choosing one of the
four core elements: Air, Earth, Fire, or Water. The
transformation grants the caster unique abilities and
resistances based on the chosen element, while
imposing limitations on communication and
spellcasting.

Air Form grants immunity to all standard physical
attacks,                             but non-physical harm does full damage; the
caster can attack with microbursts of air, but their
voice becomes a whisper, moan, or howl, making it
impossible to cast spells normally.

Earth Form grants +2 threat points to all physical
attacks,                             DR 3 and armor equivalency of d12, and
physical attacks deal additional damage, but the spell
must be prepared in advance.

Energy Form transforms you into a being of pure,
radiant                            energy. You become immune to standard
physical attacks and gain the ability to phase through
solid objects. However, you are now vulnerable to
attacks that disrupt magical energies, such as those
from specific artifacts or spells designed to counter
magic. You can unleash blasts of pure energy as a
weapon, harming both physical and energy-based
defenses. This transformation comes at a cost: your
voice is reduced to a series of crackles and pops,

116


making normal speech and spellcasting impossible.
You                              retain a vague humanoid shape formed of
crackling energy, but your movements become erratic
and unpredictable, influenced by the flow of magical
currents in the environment.

Fire Form grants
immunity             to physical
attacks and fire
damage, but water,
air, and concussive
attacks do full
damage; the caster’s
fists of flame deal
ability branch +5
threat points, but
their voice becomes a
crackling or roaring
tone, preventing
spellcasting.

Water Form grants
immunity              to non-
magical physical
attacks, but
explosions that bypass
shielding deal full
damage; the caster

can attack with hydraulic fists, but their voice
becomes                                 a bubbling rush, and normal spellcasting
becomes impossible. The transformation costs a base
of 5 Spirit Points; additional Spirit Points may be
spent to increase threat points, resistance, or attack
potency by +1 for each point spent.

Energy Blade: d12—Legendary—Harm
Description: [M/ Self] Creates a bladed weapon of
pure                              visible energy that buzzes faintly. The caster
wields this blade of light as if it were a real weapon,
using the higher of the Competence → Expertise or
Prowess → Melee branches. The weapon can harm

creatures or objects. Any non-magical weapon, shield,
or                              armor hit by the energy blade (e.g., if blocking),
must make an item saving throw (see GM Section) or
be reduced by one step of armor or shield protection
or, if a fragile object, totally destroyed. Even if it

saves, its attack/
defense        value is
reduced by 2 threat
points until repaired.

Glacial Prison:
d12+2—Legendary)—
Afflict

Description: [M /
Creature]          With a surge
of frigid energy, the
caster encases a target
in a solid block of ice,
requiring the target to
make a valorous
saving throw against
the caster's ability roll
to avoid becoming
frozen. If
unsuccessful, the
target remains
immobilized and

immune to all damage and effects for rounds equal to
the caster's level. At the end of each round, the target
may attempt another valorous saving throw to break
free and act normally on its next turn. While
maintaining this spell, the caster incurs a -5 penalty
to all other ability tests not related to spellcasting.

The spell carries a base challenge die of d12+2 due to
its                            Legendary potency level and costs 2 spirit points to
cast.

117


GRIMOIRE


Quicksand: d12—Legendary—Activate
Description: [M / Area variant] Creates a pool of
quicksand,                                12 feet in diameter, plus 4 feet deep for
every die rank in Competence (i.e. up to 20 ft deep).

Those in the area of effect must make a skillful saving
throw                             (Prowess → Agility → Speed or Reaction) to
avoid being trapped. Any about to enter the area must
make a cognitive saving throw (Competence →
Adroitness → Skulduggery or Cleverness) to avoid it.

Creatures trapped by the quicksand begin to sink up
to                                the waist; struggling will not make them sink
further.

Those trapped are immobilized but may use their
arms.                              Trying to pull the victim out requires a Fortitude

→ Strength → Ferocity or Might roll versus the
caster’s                               spell roll, but such force directly damages the
victim, causing threat points equal to the roll to
passive defense. Casting Modifiers: +5 to the
challenge die to alter the sand’s viscosity,
asphyxiating victims by sinking them completely,
causing 4 threat points per round until they escape.

Those in the pool are expelled without further harm
when the spell ends.

Tidal Surge: d12—Legendary—Modify, Harm (1 SP)
Description: [M / Area] The magic-wielder calls forth
a massive surge of water, creating a tidal wave that

crashes over a designated area. Targets caught in the
wave                               suffer 4 harm points and are knocked prone,
while objects or structures in the area may be
destroyed. The tidal wave can sweep away any smaller
creatures or objects in its path. The area of effect is up
to 2 × the magic-wielder’s basic die rank in height,
width, and depth in feet. The spell can only be cast
near a large body of water or in an area with a
significant amount of water present.

Wind Riding: d12 (Variable)—Legendary—Activate
Description: [M / Self or Creature] Allows gliding
flight                                   for self, another, or others, at the speed of the
caster’s ability branch MV ×2 in mph. Intelligent
creatures granted the ability of wind riding can direct
their movement out of the caster’s line of sight, so
long as the spell is maintained. Unintelligent animals
lose the ability upon leaving the caster’s line of sight.
Casting Modifiers: none for self, one target creature at
d14, or selected creatures in 20-foot diameter area of
effect at d20+4.

SORCERY

Offense Spells

Chaos Assault: d4-d12—variable-Harm
Description: Chaos Assault is the signature offensive
spell                                    of sorcerers, embodying the volatile and
unpredictable nature of chaos. The spell’s form and
damage vary, reflecting different aspects of chaos,
void, and shadows. The caster selects one
manifestation upon casting. Manifestations include:

Flux: A chaotic blend of colors, warping space around
it                                as it streaks towards its target.

Void: A dark sphere of nothingness that erodes
anything it touches.

118


Shadow: A shadowy tendril, chilling the air as it
strikes.

Mind: A wave of disruptive psychic energy assaulting
the                           target's senses.

Phantasm: Conjures nightmarish illusions, causing
fear                             or hallucinations.

This spell can be modified and enhanced using the
following options:

Range and Dimensions

Maximum Range: Calculated as (Competence →
Expertise MV) × 4 feet. If a Mastery Die is used, the
range is doubled.

Sorcerous Bolt: Appears as a 1-foot diameter mass
targeting a single enemy.

Sorcerous Stream: Forms a beam of similar width and
a                              length equal to (Competence → Expertise MV) × 4
feet.

Sorcerous Burst: Creates an area effect with a radius
equal                               to (2 × Competence → Expertise MV) + Wizardry
bonuses in feet. Mastery Die doubles the area of effect
when utilized.

Challenge Die and Threat Point Increase: To increase
the                              threat points of the spell, the caster can introduce
a challenge die. The initial increase is always to a d4
challenge die, which adds +1 to the threat points. Each
subsequent increase in the challenge die (d6, d8, d10,
d12) raises the threat points by an additional +1. For
example, a d6 challenge die adds +2 to the threat
points, a d8 adds +3, and so on

Stream (Challenge d6): Increases the Challenge Die by
one step (e.g., d4 to d6) and requires an ongoing
maintenance penalty of –1 per additional round.

Threat Points increase by +2 per round.

Burst (Challenge d8/d10): Converts the spell to affect
an                              area, increasing the Challenge Die. At d8, it creates
an area-of-effect explosion affecting multiple
enemies. At d10, it becomes an enhanced area
explosion with increased radius and damage.

Afflictions: Sorcerers can add one affliction to the
attack, which immediately affects the target. Each
affliction increases the Challenge Die and costs
additional Spirit Points.

Afflictions

Temporal Disruption (Challenge d4): This affliction
manifests                               as a distortion in time around the target,
causing them to experience brief lapses in perception
and reaction. The effect reduces their initiative by one
battle phase (effectively reducing the basic Prowess
rank by one full step, e.g., from d10 to d8). Increase
the difficulty of the sorcerer's test by +1 when slowing
the target two battle phases, +2 for three battle
phases, and so on. A victim can be dropped down to
below a d2 basic Prowess, with movement reduced
accordingly. This affliction typically lasts for one
round unless specified otherwise.

Shadow Knock (Challenge d6): This effect appears as
a                             shadowy force sweeping the target off their feet or a
tendril of darkness pushing against them. The target
must make a Skillful saving throw. On a failed save,
the target is knocked prone or knocked back.

Knockback distance is determined by the caster's
Willpower                              die rank in feet. A successful save avoids
the effect. Knockback may trigger opportunity attacks
if the target ends within another creature's reach.

Mind Stun (Challenge d8): The stunning effect is
caused                                by a wave of psychic energy short-circuiting
the target's senses or a burst of chaotic energy
overwhelming them. The target may not move or
attack for one full round and is considered
temporarily incapacitated. This stun effect typically
lasts for one round unless specified otherwise.

Sensory Overload (Challenge d10): This affliction
severely                         compromises or overloads a target's sensory
perception through nightmarish illusions or chaotic
energy. Most Competence → Perception checks using
the affected sense automatically fail, with a possible –
5 penalty for compensation attempts. Attacks by
affected characters suffer a -4 penalty to potential

119


GRIMOIRE


harm. For those with a d4 in the relevant ability, this
often results in minimal or no threat points. Effects
typically last one round unless specified otherwise.

Defense Spells

Sorcerers use a universal Eldritch Defense spell,
customized                              to fit their sorcerous path, offering either
Sorcerous Shielding or Sorcerous Armor. The spell's
potency scales with the caster's proficiency,
determined by the Challenge Die rank selected during
casting.

Sorcerous Shielding: (d4 to d12)—Common—
Protect

Description: The caster creates a swirling shield of
dark                             energy or chaotic sorcerous power that envelops
the target, reducing threat points from incoming
attacks. This shield manifests as a semi-transparent
energy field, often appearing as dark tendrils or
shimmering distortions that warp reality around the
target.

Shielding Effect: Reduces incoming threat points by
an amount equal to the Challenge Die rank. For
example, a d4 reduces threat by 1, a d6 reduces by 2,
and so on, up to a maximum reduction of 5 at d12.

Maintenance: The caster may maintain the shield, but
incurs a cumulative -1 penalty to other actions for each
additional round it is sustained.

Spirit Point (SP) Cost: Each casting requires 1 SP per
rank of the Challenge Die. A d4 costs 1 SP, d6 costs 2
SP, and so on, up to 5 SP for d12.

Sorcerous Armor: (d4 to d12)—Common—Protect
Description: The caster weaves a layer of magical
protection around the target, enhancing their
resilience                           against harm. This Sorcerous Armor appears
as an invisible barrier or a subtle shimmer that molds

to the target's form, acting as an additional layer of
defense.

Armor Effect: Provides Damage Reduction (DR) equal
to                                the Challenge Die rank. For example, a d4 version
provides +1 DR, d6 adds +2 DR, and so on, up to a
maximum of +4 DR at d10. The DR applies after the
target’s active defense is depleted.

Maintenance: Maintaining this magical armor
requires                        concentration, with the caster incurring a -1
penalty to other actions per additional round it is
sustained.

Spirit Point (SP) Cost: Each casting requires 1 SP per
rank of the Challenge Die. A d4 costs 1 SP, d6 costs 2
SP, and so on, up to 5 SP for d12.

Versatility of Sorcerous Defense: Sorcerers wield
Eldritch                            Defense to adapt to threats, whether by
adding layers of magical armor or conjuring shields of
dark energy.

Common

Arcane Lock: d4—Common—Protect

Description: [M / Object] The caster imbues an object
with                                an arcane lock, making it more difficult to open
or break into by one challenge die level. Locks, boxes,
and so on are rated d4 to d12 for security (increasing
to d14, d16, d18, d20 as needed). Casting Modifiers: +2
per additional challenge die level added.

Arcane Mark: d4—Common—Modify
Description: [Inst / Object] The caster imbues an
object                               with an arcane mark, allowing him or her to

locate it from a distance. The mark lasts for one week
per                             caster level or until dispelled. The caster can
concentrate on it for a few minutes to get a direction
and distance for the object, if within 10 miles per
caster level. Casting Modifiers: +1 per extra week’s
duration.

120


Minor Illusion: d4—Common—Activate
Description: [M / Area] Creates a simple visual
illusion                                 of an object. It looks like an object is there
when it isn’t. The object must be small, less than a
cubic foot, and easy to describe.

Olfactory Illusion: d4—Common—Activate.
Description: [Inst / Object] Creates a simple olfactory
illusion                                 of a smell. It smells like whatever the caster
chooses, within the scope of his or her own
experience. Musty, rot, skunk, dry wood, paper,
textiles, vegetation, smoke, incense and perfumes,
salty air, fresh blood, guano, offal, or rotting meat, to
list a few ideas

Shadow Step: d4—Common—Activate
Description: [M / Self] The caster can shadowstep
short                            distances by moving rapidly between shadows.
This can be used to get past obstacles or escape
danger quickly. The distance the caster can
shadowstep is determined by his or her basic
Competence die rank × 5 feet. Casting Modifiers: +1
per 5 feet increase.

Teleport Object: d4 (Variable)—Common—Activate
Description: [Inst / Object] Translocates an item from
place                                to place. The target object is teleported a short
distance, up to 10 × basic tier MV in feet within line of
sight. The object’s size determines the challenge die:
d4 for minuscule to d12+2 for gargantuan. (For size
ranges and challenge dice, see the Object Summoning
Difficulty table page 244).

Transmute Rock: d4—Common—Modify
Description: [M / Object] The caster can temporarily
transmute                                    a small amount of rock or stone (about half
a brick per level) into a different substance, such as
mud or sand. Casting Modifiers: +1 per additional ‘half
brick’ volume transmuted.

Uncommon

Audio Illusion: d6—Uncommon—Activate
Description: [M / Creature] The caster manipulates
illusionary sound. The creature the spell targets
perceives                                  a caster-specified object as the sound
source. The sound can be anything the caster wishes
and can be soft or loud, but not painfully loud. If
someone who suspects the sound isn’t real makes a
successful Competence → Perception roll, he or she
will know it is illusory.

Chameleon: d6—Uncommon—Activate
Description: [M / Self] This spell lets the caster blend
in                                   with the surroundings, but he or she cannot move.
People not specifically looking for someone are
unlikely to notice anything unusual. Perception rolls
used to detect the caster are at –3.

Dustify: d6—Uncommon—Destroy

Description: [Inst / Object] The caster channels
destructive                             energy towards an object, causing it to
disintegrate into dust. The size of the object that can
be affected by this spell increases with the caster’s
level: a maximum of 1 cubic foot or 100 pounds weight
per level, whichever is less. The spell cannot target a
living creature

Enfeeblement: d6—Uncommon—Modify
Description: [Inst / Creature] The caster weakens the
target’s physical abilities, reducing its Strength and
Agility by 2 points for each level of the caster (this
may result in a negative score when trying to use the
abilities                            while the spell is maintained). Casting
modifier: +1 per extra target within range.

Flux Portal: d6—Uncommon—Activate
Description: [M / Self, Creature] The caster creates a
temporary portal to another location. The portal can
transport the caster and a single ally or item with a

121


GRIMOIRE


weight of up to ability branch MV × 20 pounds. The
portal                               can be used once before dissipating, but the
caster can choose to maintain concentration to keep
the portal open longer

Illusory Disguise: d6—Uncommon—Modify
Description: [M / Creature] The caster can fully
change                                    the appearance of a recipient, including
clothing, to make him or her look like a specific
individual. The illusion is visual only; voice and scent
are not altered in any way. If someone who suspects
the impersonation makes a successful Competence →
Perception roll, he or she will see through the illusion.

Phantom Blade: d6—Uncommon—Harm
Description: [Inst / Creature] The caster creates a
magical                                  blade made of pure energy that can be wielded
as a weapon, and can be used to strike from a distance.
The blade inflicts harm equal to the ability branch.

The blade is visible but can pass through solid objects,
making                                  it an ideal weapon for surprise attacks

Summon Monster: d6 (Variable)—Uncommon—
Activate

Description: [M / Special] The sorcerer summons a
humanoid monster to beset his foes, shaping its
visage within his imagination and bringing it forth
from the magical weave. The chosen challenge die
rank determines both monster hit points (using MV)
and potential harm. The sorcerer chooses the die type
(d4 or d6 for a rank and file creature, d8 to d12 for a
stronger one) and number of dice (1 for a minor
creature, 2 for a standard one). For example, to
summon a strong standard 2d12 creature, the caster
must succeed in a roll versus 2d12. If the spell is
maintained beyond the first encounter, the monster
gets to roll a save vs. Fortitude → Willpower →
Resistance, and disappears if the save is successful.

Esoteric

Apport Object: d8—Esoteric—Activate
Description: [Inst / Object] With this spell the caster
can                                apport (materialize) an object attuned to him
within line of sight. The attuned object can weigh up
to 2500 lb, e.g., as large as a 3 ft boulder, a horse, or a

wagon, and may be as far away as ability branch MV ×
10                                miles when apported. Attunement requires that the
caster have daily contact with an object for one
month, and inscribe it with his or her personal sigil.

Casting Modifiers: If the caster wants to drop
something                              out of the sky on an enemy, add +2 to the
challenge die per 10 feet above the target that the
object appears

Cone of Silence: d8—Esoteric—Activate
Description: [M / Area] The caster creates an area of
silence                                  that sound cannot penetrate. The affected area
is a cone-shaped space with a base diameter equal to
the caster’s ability branch MV × 6 inches and a height
equal to the base diameter. Sounds cannot pass from
the inside to the outside of the area or vice versa.

Those within the cone can hear one another if they are
in                              direct contact, but sounds do not travel through the
air. The cone is usually oriented with its point
upwards. The spell can be used for privacy or for
offensive purposes. If used offensively, targets must
make a valorous save to resist its effects

Full Body Illusion: d8—Esoteric—Activate
Description: [M / Self] Completely alter one’s
appearance                                      to look like another living creature. Can
fully change appearance, including clothing, voice,
and scent, into something else entirely. This is only an
illusion and grants none of the powers of the creature
imitated. It can be used to mimic specific individuals.
If someone who suspects the impersonation makes a
successful Competence → Perception roll, he or she
will see through the illusion.

122


Illusory Quiescence: d8—Esoteric—Activate
Description                                [M / Self]: Through this power, the caster
can appear motionless, as if standing still and
pondering something, or merely speaking, while
enacting some complex movement, usually activating
a spell, or perhaps using a missile weapon or palming
something. The effect persists for one round of time:
anything that takes longer will be noticed. Note that
this power’s effect can also be broken by a suspicious
(e.g. attacked) character making a successful
Fortitude → Willpower → Resistance roll

Minion Horde: d8—Esoteric—Activate

Description: [M / Creature]: Summons a horde of
humanoid                              minions to attack an enemy. The number of
creatures summoned is equal to the result of the
ability check, and each creature has 1 threat point, 1
hit point, and 0 active defense. The creatures’ group
prowess rank (inititiave) is equal to the caster’s
specialty die. The spell operates much like a regular
area effect Harm spell, with the horde attacking as
many targets as it can surround, but unlike such a
spell, threat points are divided among those trapped
by the summoned attackers. Such swarms are always
instinct-driven, and while able to follow simple
commands, never possess real intelligence or
significant equipment. The caster can cast other spells
while directing the horde. The normal maintenance
penalty applies.

Object Space: d8—Esoteric—Activate
Description: [M / Special] Ability to access an extra
dimensional area for holding items. The size of the
space accessed is the Competence MV in cubic feet.

Objects in the sub-dimension will remain there until
removed, and do not age, rot, or deteriorate. If the
spell is not maintained, the item is inaccessible until
the spell is recast. The space is incompatible with
living matter, so any attempt to teleport creatures

into it will fizzle. (A sorcerer could open another’s
object                             space by extracting the attunement knowledge
with a spell and then using this spell at double the
challenge die.)

Phantasms: d8—Esoteric—Harm

Description: [M / Creature] The caster draws forth an
apparition of the target’s worst nightmares from his
mind, causing psychic damage. This is non-lethal
preternatural harm: it cannot be blocked or parried by
normal shields or swords, and subdues the target but
does not kill. This spell drains spirit points, then
passive defense after. A victim brought to zero passive
defense in this manner is incapacitated until brought
above zero. The victim must then make a Fortitude →
Willpower → Resistance saving throw versus the
attack roll or remain unconscious for another 1d4
rounds. The spell is maintainable, even if the victim
leaves the sight of the original caster, inflicting the
same amount of damage each round until the victim
makes a successful saving throw to break free of the
apparition.

Transdimensional Shift: d8 (Variable)—Esoteric—
Activate

Description: [M / Self, Object] The user activates a
brief                               portal to another realm, enabling instant travel
between two locations. The challenge die dictates the
maximum distance, ranging from d4 (short) to d8
(long). The shift accommodates the user and an object
weighing up to ability branch MV × 20 pounds. The
portal remains active for a single use but can be
sustained longer through concentration. Casting
Modifiers: Scaling; Starting at d8, each die rank
increase allows the transport of one additional
creature or object. If cast with a d4, the user can only
transport themselves but gains a +2 bonus on the next
physical or mental ability test.

Occult


Dimensional Travel: d10—Occult—Activate
Description: [Inst / Area special] This spell allows the
caster                               and other willing creatures to travel to and
through other dimensions or planes of existence.

Other beneficial spells must be prepared if that plane
features                                  an inhospitable environment. The location
arrived at is an exact location outlined in the complex
verbalizing of the spell. It must have been visited
before or studied extensively in books and accurately
envisioned. All willing creatures in the area of effect
(MV × 5 feet radius) are dimensionally shifted, along
with any visible objects willed by the caster within the
area of effect up to 300 lbs. Other dimensions or
planes can be any fantastical place the GM allows in
the campaign. Shifting to a place inaccurately
envisioned may result in going astray by 2d6 miles
outside, 2d6 rooms inside.

Havoc: d10—Occult—Modify

Description: [M / Area] This spell invokes and
unleashes                                 the dangerous and disorienting effects of
chaos in a designated area. The caster meditates on
the philosophical principle of unreality in the
universe, channeling chaotic energy to play havoc
with ordered reality in the affected area. A successful
roll imposes a –4 penalty to saves versus any magical
effects, to one’s ability to see through illusions, and to
attempts to cast spells that tend to increase order
(such as control, healing, or information spells).

Those in the area can attempt a Fortitude → Willpower

→ Resilience save to throw off the effects.

Mirrored Opponent: d10—Occult—Activate
Description: [Inst / Special] The caster, by mental
command, activates an illusion affecting a target
observing his own reflection in a mirror. An
illusionary mirrored likeness steps from the mirror

and attacks the target. This effect generates non-
physical                              threat points, reducing the victim’s passive
defense, no matter if active defense is attempted! The
character will be duped by the spell until a successful
saving throw is made (allowed once per round versus
the illusory source of magic, not per attack). Luckily,
illusion threat points are non-lethal, meaning that
although such an attack can knock out an opponent, it
cannot reduce Fortitude below zero. Others observing
the victim being attacked by his apparent double may
notice the mirror reversal.

Teleport Self: d10—Occult—Activate
Description: [Inst / Self] Translocate oneself,
including                           any objects on one’s person. Distance

traveled by the caster, and all worn or carried, is up to
10                                  × basic tier MV in feet within line of sight.

The sorcerer can attempt to use teleportation
defensively.                                If an enemy’s attack fails to penetrate the
caster’s active defense, the caster can make a
challenge roll versus the challenge die of the spell and
the attacker’s roll. If both are successful, the teleport
activates, and the magic-wielder escapes close

124


engagement or a vulnerable location with no
opportune attack allowed. If the enemy’s attack
penetrates, this maneuver will not work.

Waking Terror: d10—Occult—Afflict
Description: [Inst / Special] The target suffers
overwhelming, paralyzing terror. The target is
stunned                                   and loses access to any active defense, but
can still use innate powers or cast spells with no

words or gestures. A victim must make a Fortitude →
Willpower roll each time to attack or focus on
anything other than the waking terror brought to its
mind by the spell. In addition to the initial saving
throw, the victim can attempt each round to break the
illusion with a Fortitude → Willpower → Resilience
roll.

Whisper of Woe: d10—Uncommon—Afflict, Mental
Description: [M / Creature] The caster whispers a
mournful chant, filling the air with a palpable sense of
dread. The target feels their mental strength wane,
their resolve crumbling under the weight of unseen
burdens. This saps the target's mental fortitude,
overwhelming them with despair and reducing their
will to fight. The primary effect of the spell is to
reduce the target's Willpower by one die rank for one
round. This reduction decreases the target's Spirit
Points, making them more susceptible to fear, mental
influence, and skill checks requiring willpower. The
secondary effect is a -2 penalty on all Willpower-
based skill checks. Maintenance: -3

Legendary

Apport Creature: d12—Legendary—Afflict
Description                               [Inst / Creature]: With this spell the caster
can apport (materialize) a creature attuned to him
within line of sight. The attuned creature may be as
far away as ability branch MV × 10 miles when
apported. To attune it, the caster must (usually with
the aid of skill in Arcanum) bind the creature to him

via an already attuned item, such as magical shackles,
an                          irremovable bracelet, or an embedded gem. Item
attunement requires that the caster have daily contact
with the item for one month, and inscribe it with his

or her personal sigil. Binding is easy with a tamed
animal                              such as a horse. Control of monsters and so on
must be established by other means.

Casting Modifiers: If the caster wants to drop the
creature out of the sky on an enemy, add +2 to the
challenge die per 10 feet above the target that the

creature appears. This immediately allows the upset

creature a Fortitude → Willpower → Resistance roll to
break the attunement. Apporting a creature larger
than a horse requires a larger challenge of 2d12
(elephant-sized) or 3d12 (dragon-sized)

Assume Inanimate Form: d12—Legendary—
Activate

Description: [M / Creature]: This spell makes the
recipient                              look like an inanimate object: a chair, table,
pillar, chest, barrel, rug, etc., as desired. The illusion
only fools visual searches; scent and touch are not
affected. Perception can be used to detect those
hidden by this illusion, but people not specifically
looking for someone are unlikely to notice anything
unusual.

Dreamscape: d12—Legendary—Afflict

Description: [M / Creature] Creates a fully immersive
illusion                             for a victim. This is the big boy of the illusion
category. The victim only experiences what the caster
wishes, and believes what he sees, feels, and hears.

This can be a simple scenario where the victim thinks
everything, including that cliff, is 5 feet to the left, or
he can be led to believe he is at the gates of hell. It is
resisted by a Fortitude → Willpower → Resilience roll.

Mass Invisibility: d12—Legendary—Modify
Description: [M / Area] Mass Invisibility allows the
caster                              to conceal several selected targets within a

125


GRIMOIRE


selected area, even while they are moving. The spell’s
range                               is calculated as caster’s Competence →
Expertise MV × 4 (doubled if activated with a mastery
die), and its area of effect is a circle of radius
Competence → Expertise MV × 2 + Wizardry or
Theurgy bonus. While the spell does not hide sound,
smell, or touch, Perception checks for Mass
Invisibility recipients are at a –5 penalty. Attackers
must pass a Perception check (at –5) to attack at –5;
otherwise, they strike randomly at –12.

THAUMATURGY

Offensive Spells

Thaumaturgy represents a methodical and scholarly
approach                                 to magic, focusing on the precise
manipulation of arcane energies.

Arcane Assault: d4-d12—Variable—Harm
Description: Thaumaturges use Arcane Bolt as their
primary offensive spell, which can be imbued with
various magical properties reflecting different aspects
of arcane study. These manifestations include

Force: A pure expression of magical energy, impacting
targets                            with raw power.

Transmutation: Alters the physical properties of the
target.

Abjuration: Disrupts other magical effects
surrounding the target.

Divination: Reveals hidden truths or weaknesses in
the target.

Range and Dimensions

Maximum Range: Calculated as (Competence →
Expertise MV) × 4 feet. If a Mastery Die is used, the
range is doubled.

Arcane Bolt: A 1-foot diameter bolt targeting a single
enemy.

Arcane Stream: A continuous beam with a width of 2
feet and a length equal to (Competence → Expertise
MV) × 4 feet.

Arcane Burst: An area effect with a radius of (2 ×
Competence → Expertise MV) + Wizardry bonuses in
feet. Mastery Die doubles the area of effect when
utilized.

Challenge Die and Threat Point Increase: To increase
the                               threat points of the spell, the caster can introduce a
challenge die. The initial increase is always to a d4
challenge die, which adds +1 to the threat points. Each
subsequent increase in the challenge die (d6, d8, d10,
d12) raises the threat points by an additional +1. For
example, a d6 challenge die adds +2 to the threat
points, a d8 adds +3, and so on.

Stream (Challenge d6): Increases the Challenge Die by
one step (e.g., d4 to d6) and requires an ongoing
maintenance penalty of –1 per additional round.

Threat Points increase by +2 per round.

Burst (Challenge d8/d10): Converts the spell to affect
an                              area, increasing the Challenge Die. At d8, it creates
an area-of-effect explosion affecting multiple
enemies. At d10, it becomes an enhanced area
explosion with increased radius and damage.

Afflictions

Thaumaturges can add one affliction to the attack,
which                         immediately affects the target. Each affliction
increases the Challenge Die and costs additional Spirit
Points.

Afflictions Breakdown

Arcane Impediment (Challenge d4): This affliction
slows                               the target by interfering with the flow of
magical energy around them. The effect reduces their
initiative by one battle phase (effectively reducing the
basic Prowess rank by one full step, e.g., from d10 to
d8). Increase the difficulty of the thaumaturge's test
by +1 when slowing the target two battle phases, +2

126


for three battle phases, and so on. A victim can be
dropped down to below a d2 basic Prowess, with
movement reduced accordingly. This affliction
typically lasts for one round unless specified
otherwise.

Arcane Displacement (Challenge d6): Uses precise
magical                              force to knock targets prone or push them
back. The target must make a Skillful saving throw. On
a failed save, the target is knocked prone or knocked
back. Knockback distance is determined by the
caster's Willpower die rank in feet. A successful save
avoids the effect. Knockback may trigger opportunity
attacks if the target ends within another creature's
reach.

Arcane Disruption (Challenge d8): Temporarily
severs                                the target's connection to magical energies,
stunning them. The target may not move or attack for
one full round and is considered temporarily
incapacitated. This stun effect typically lasts for one
round unless specified otherwise.

Arcane Overload (Challenge d10): Overwhelms the
target's                             senses with an excess of magical information,
severely compromising their perception and actions.
Most Competence → Perception checks using the
affected sense automatically fail, with a possible –5
penalty for compensation attempts. Attacks by
affected characters suffer a -4 penalty to potential
harm. For those with a d4 in the relevant ability, this
often results in minimal or no threat points. Effects
typically last one round unless specified otherwise.

Defense Spells

Thaumaturges build their defense spells from Eldritch
Armor                             and Eldritch Shield, offering two primary
forms of protection: Arcane Shielding and Arcane
Armor. The spell's potency scales with the caster's
proficiency, determined by the Challenge Die rank
selected during casting.

Arcane Shielding (d4 to d12 — Common —
Protect)

Description: The caster creates a swirling shield of
dark                             energy or chaotic thaumaturgic power that
envelops the target, reducing threat points from
incoming attacks. This shield manifests as a semi-
transparent energy field, often appearing as dark
tendrils or shimmering distortions that warp reality
around the target.

Shielding Effect: Reduces incoming threat points by
an amount equal to the Challenge Die rank. For
example, a d4 reduces threat by 1, a d6 reduces by 2,
and so on, up to a maximum reduction of 5 at d12.

Maintenance: The caster may maintain the shield, but
incurs a cumulative –1 penalty to other actions for
each additional round it is sustained.

Spirit Point (SP) Cost: Each casting requires 1 SP per
rank of the Challenge Die. A d4 costs 1 SP, d6 costs 2
SP, and so on, up to 5 SP for d12.

Arcane Armor (d4 to d12 — Common — Protect)
Description: The caster weaves a layer of magical
protection around the target, enhancing their
resilience                                against harm. This Arcane Armor appears as
an invisible barrier or a subtle shimmer that molds to
the target's form, acting as an additional layer of
defense.

Armor Effect: Provides Damage Reduction (DR) equal
to                                the Challenge Die rank. For example, a d4 version
provides +1 DR, d6 adds +2 DR, and so on, up to a
maximum of +4 DR at d10. The DR applies after the
target’s active defense is depleted.

Maintenance: Maintaining this magical armor
requires                        concentration, with the caster incurring a –1
penalty to other actions per additional round it is
sustained.

Spirit Point (SP) Cost: Each casting requires 1 SP per
rank of the Challenge Die. A d4 costs 1 SP, d6 costs 2
SP, and so on, up to 5 SP for d12.

127


GRIMOIRE


Arcane Walls

Thaumaturges can extend their protective magic to
create Arcane Walls, providing cover and strategic
advantages on the battlefield.

Dimensions

Length: Equal to the caster’s Competence → Expertise
MV                               × 2 in feet.

Height: Standard height of 5 feet, adjustable based on
the caster's intent.

Thickness: Increases with the Challenge Die, from 1
foot at d4 up to 5 feet at d12.

Effects

Cover: Provides total or partial cover, granting
bonuses                             to defense against ranged attacks.

Threat Reduction: Imposes a –4 Threat Point
reduction                              to attacks passing through the wall due to
its protective interference.

Transparency: The Arcane Wall can be opaque or
translucent, at the caster's discretion, affecting
visibility.

Modifiers

Reftective Surface: By increasing the SP Cost by 1, the
wall can reflect a portion of magical attacks back at
the attacker.

Enhanced Resistance: Additional SP can be spent to
increase the wall’s resistance to specific types of
damage (e.g., physical, elemental).

Versatility and Adaptation

Thaumaturges excel at manipulating their Arcane
Barrier                               to suit various situations.

Shape Manipulation: The barrier or wall can be
shaped into angles, arcs, or even domes, offering
flexibility in protection.

Selective Protection: The caster can designate which
creatures are protected or hindered by the barrier.

Limitations

Concentration: Sustaining complex barriers requires
significant                              focus, limiting the caster's ability to
perform other strenuous actions.

Energy Demand: High-level barriers consume more
Spirit                              Points and may quickly deplete the caster's
reserves if used excessively.

Practical Applications

Battlefield Control: Use Arcane Walls to funnel
enemies or protect flanks.

Team Protection: Shield allies during retreats or when
preparing powerful attacks.

Environmental Adaptation: Create barriers to block
environmental hazards, such as fire or toxic gas.

Common

Banish: d4—Common—Afflict

Description: [Inst / Creature] Banish a summoned
creature.                          Banishment requires meeting or exceeding
the challenge die needed to summon the targeted
creature (the GM should know this but keep it secret).
Success means the summoning is broken, and the
creature will vanish. Even a failed attempt to banish a
summoned creature allows it an immediate saving
throw to break free of the original summoner’s
command. All casters know when a summoned
creature under their command is subject to an attempt
to banish it.

Claw Growth: d4—Common—Modify

Description: [M / Creature] Claw Growth imbues the
recipient's unarmed strikes with arcane potency.

These enchanted claws receive a +1 bonus to threat
points                               but still interact with armor in the usual way.
Unlike typical unarmed attacks, these arcane-imbued
strikes don't suffer extra damage from parries,
making them as viable as wielding a mundane
weapon..

128


Conjure Weapon: d4 —Common—Activate.
Description: [M / Special] Conjure Weapon enables
the                              caster to materialize a basic weapon from a
mystical armory, which most thaumaturges prepare
in advance. The conjured weapon conforms to the
standard statistics of its type. A roll exceeding 4
ensures the weapon's immediate readiness for the
recipient; otherwise, readying the weapon takes one
round. The weapon stays in existence as long as the
caster maintains the spell, returning to the mystical
armory upon spell completion.

Echo: d4—Common—Modify

Description: [M / Object, Self] The caster imbues an
object                                 or himself or herself with a faint echo of his or
her presence, causing the spell target to resonate with
magic. Any spell cast on the object or the caster within
the next hour gains a +1 bonus to its casting roll. This
spell cannot be cast on a spell already imbued with
Echo. Note: This spell can be used to enhance the
effectiveness of other spells, making them more likely
to succeed.

Fortify Object: d4 —Common—Modify
Description: [M / Object] Activate this spell to
augment                                       an object's resilience, making it tougher to
break or destroy. The spell increases the object's
structural hit points based on the caster's roll and the
object's initial structural HP as specified in the
Table—General Categories of Size and Weights (see
page 251). To determine the spell's effect, add the
caster's roll to the object's existing structural HP. For
example, a d4 roll of 3 will add 3 structural hit points
to the object. For objects crafted from especially
robust materials, double the caster's roll before
adding it to the object's structural HP.The effect

endures as long as the caster maintains the spell. Once
the                              spell concludes, the object reverts to its original
structural hit points..

129

Lighten: d4 —Common—Modify

Description: [M / Object] Reduces the weight of an
object                                or individual. The object must be person-sized
or less. The maintenance penalty is –1 to reduce
weight to a half, –3 to reduce weight to a quarter, and
–5 to make the object or person weightless

Magic Ride: d4—Common—Activate

Description: [M / Object]: Can add the power of flight
to                                an object. Objects can be ridden if the spell is
maintained: carpets and brooms seem especially
popular. Movement rate is the caster’s sprinting
speed (see Combat, Movement).

Mend: d4 (Variable)— Common—Restore
Description: [Inst / Object] This spell effects instant
repair                                     of an object, if most or all parts of it are
present. It will not restore missing parts. The GM sets
the challenge based on the state of the object: from
snapped in half, easy (d4), to crushed to bits, extreme
(2d12)

Savorless: d4—Common—Modify

Description: [M / Creature] Disrupts senses of taste
and                              smell. The affected creature cannot roll for
Perception with these senses (at GM’s discretion, it
can compensate for the loss, e.g., a dog tracking by
sight, not scent, may allow a roll with a –12 penalty).
The save against the spell is Fortitude → Willpower →
Resistance.

Sharpen Blade: d4—Common—Restore

Description [Inst / Object]: A specific repair spell for
maintaining weapons, restoring them to a quality like
new. Edges are sharpened, bends and rust are
removed. It cannot restore completely missing
chunks, but even a badly damaged weapon will
become serviceable.

Weaken Creature: d4 (Variable)—Common—Modify
Description: [M / Creature] The caster weakens the
target creature’s muscles, lowering its potential harm


GRIMOIRE


and physical prowess. The weakened creature has its
ability                              tests and threat points for any physical attack
or feat of strength lowered by 1 per the caster’s chosen
challenge die rank: –1 penalty at d4 to –5 at d12.

Weaken Object: d4—Common—Modify
Description: [M / Creature] Use this spell to reduce an
object's durability, making it more susceptible to
breakage. The spell decreases the object's structural
hit                                 points based on the caster's roll and the object's
initial structural HP as indicated in the Table—
General Categories of Size and Weights (see page 251).
Subtract the caster's roll from the object's existing
structural hit points to find the new, reduced
structural HP. For instance, a d4 roll of 3 will remove 3
structural hit points from the object. Objects that
reach zero structural hit points must pass a saving
throw based on their material type (Steel 3d12, Bronze
3d10, Iron 2d12, Stone 2d10, Brick 2d8, Wood 2d6) or
they will disintegrate. As an option, the caster can
ritualize this spell and combine it with a permanency
effect to make the weakening last indefinitely.

Uncommon

Contingent Notification: d6—Uncommon—
Activate

Description: [Special / Self] Using this power, the
caster                                  is alerted whenever a previously prepared time-
based power is activated. The notification is heard as a
distant chime (or similar) in the caster’s mind. This
power must be activated immediately after the power
it is to monitor. Its duration is the same as the
previously activated power since it augments that
power. The associated ward-maintained spell, or
triggering condition, is usually cast as a ritual to
maximize the duration of this spell.

Create Illusion: d6—Uncommon—Modify
Description: [M / Creature or Object] The caster
creates                                     a realistic illusion of a creature or object. The
illusion can be used to distract enemies or hide a
valuable object.

Dimensional Pocket: d6—Uncommon— Activate
Description: [M / Self, Object] The caster creates a
small                             pocket dimension within an object, allowing it
to store items without taking up physical space. The
pocket can hold up to 10 cubic feet of material and can
only be accessed by the caster. The spell lasts for up to
1 day before the pocket dimension collapses (instantly
expelling the pocketed items)

Forced Egress: d6—Uncommon—Activate
Description: [M / Area] The spell allows instant travel
outdoors, opening a portal directly outside the nearest
exit                               from the caster’s current whereabouts. After
stepping through the portal, he and others who walk
through it will find themselves at the nearest exit
threshold on the side that isn’t barred or blocked

Invisibility: d6—Uncommon—Protect

Description: [M / Creature] The caster cloaks the
target                             creature in a veil of invisibility, rendering them
invisible to the naked eye. The spell is broken if the
target attacks or performs any other aggressive
action.

Mana Burst: d6 (Variable)—Uncommon—Harm
Description: [Inst / Area] The caster channels a burst
of                         crackling energy into the surrounding area,
harming all creatures in the area of effect. The spell
inflicts ability branch potential harm +2. Threat
points can be blocked with a shield, avoided with
active defense, or absorbed by armor. Casting
Modifiers: +1 per additional threat point.

130


Phantom Steed: d6—Uncommon— Activate
Description: [M / Creature] Conjure an ethereal steed
for                                 quick and unworldly transport. The steed moves at
a speed of 50 ft per round and can bear either the
caster or an ally. The steed can phase through solid
objects, but naturally, this ability doesn't extend to
the rider. Casting Modifier: Roll an additional d8
against the ability test or expend 4 spirit points.

Success permits both steed and rider to pass safely
through                               a solid object; failure results in an abrupt halt
and ejection of the rider before the object is traversed.

Quickened Reftexes

Rank: d6—Uncommon—Modify

Description: [M / Creature]: This spell enhances the
target's                              reaction speed, granting them a temporary
boost to their initiative for a single battle phase. The
bonus to initiative is determined by the challenge die,
with a d4 providing a +1 bonus, a d6 providing a +2
bonus, and so on, up to a d12 providing a +5 bonus.

This bonus is added to the target's Prowess Score
maximum value, potentially allowing them to act
earlier in the battle phase.

Strengthen Creature: d6 (Variable)—Uncommon—
Modify.

Description: [M / Creature] The caster strengthens
the                              target creature’s muscles, raising its physical
prowess and potential harm in attacks. The
strengthened creature has its ability tests and threat
points for any physical attack or feat of strength
raised by 1 per the caster’s chosen challenge die rank:

+1 at d4 to +5 at d12

Weapon Readiness: d6—Uncommon—Activate.
Description: [Inst / Object] The caster makes the
weapon                             held by the target better attuned to the
wielder. This spell grants a +2 initiative bonus to the
target weapon, even if the wielder does not normally

benefit from weapon bonuses (i.e. if not specialized in
Melee)

Esoteric

Dance of Blades: d8—Esoteric—Harm
Description: [M / Area] Animate and direct weapons
within                                     a designated area (radius determined by 2x
Competence → Expertise MV + Wizardry or Theurgy
bonus). Initially, the spell controls a single weapon.
However, a successful mastery die roll increases the
number of weapons manipulated to your ability
branch's MV. Directed weapons can engage enemies
autonomously, with each doing d4 threat points of
damage individually. When focusing the spell's
energy on a single blade, the threat points rise to d8.
Should the caster have the Ferocity focus, that bonus
adds to the threat points.

Elemental Transmutation: d8— Esoteric—Modify
Description: [M / Object] Transform a non-living
object                              into a different elemental state—lead to gold,
wood to crystal, etc. The object's pre-transmutation
value must not exceed the caster's ability branch MV
in silver pieces ($10 per coin). Once cast, the
transmutation becomes permanent unless the caster
reverses it or someone dispels it.

Illusionary Clone: d8—Esoteric—Protect
Description: [M / Creature] The caster creates an
illusionary                               clone, which appears to be an identical
copy of the caster. The clone has no physical presence
and cannot interact with the environment, but can be
used as a decoy to distract enemies. The clone lasts for
up to 1 minute or until dispelled or the caster stops
maintaining the spell.

131


GRIMOIRE

Levitation: d8—Esoteric—Modify
Description: [M / Creature] The caster
causes                       the target to levitate up to 10 feet
above the ground and remain in mid-
air. The target can move in any
direction, but cannot exceed the
maximum height. The target cannot
take any other actions while levitating,
and the spell lasts for up to 1 minute


Manipulate Object: d8—Esoteric—
Modify

Description: [M / Object] The caster can
cause a mechanical thing to operate
independently of a person, affecting
medium-sized things up to 300 lbs.

This can cause a water wheel to start
spinning,                      a door to unlock, a chest lid to
open, etc. The object targeted operates
as if manipulated by hand, unless too
complex for intuitive activation or use.
Such use may spring a trapped object or
activate a contingent spell

Spatial Warp: d8—Esoteric—Modify

Description: [M / Object] The caster manipulates the
fabric                                 of space around an object, causing it to teleport
to a new location within the caster's line of sight and a
range up to the caster's ability level multiplied by 10 in
feet. The object must weigh less than or equal to the
caster's ability level multiplied by 5 pounds and
cannot be living or attached to a living creature. If the
object belongs to another person, that person may
make a Fortitude save, using Willpower and
Resistance as key abilities, to prevent the effect.

Transmute Flesh: d8—Esoteric—Modify
Description: [M / Creature] The caster transforms the
target’s flesh into a different substance, such as stone

or metal. The target’s physical appearance changes to
reflect the new substance, and they gain resistance to
physical harm. However, it also loses mobility and
may suffer other negative effects at the GM’s
discretion. The target may make a Fortitude save to
resist the effect.

Occult

Deafness: d10—Occult—Afflict

Description: [M / Creature] Disrupts the sense of
hearing.                           Perception checks by the affected creature
using hearing automatically fail (at GM’s discretion, it
can compensate for the loss, e.g., lip reading may
allow a roll with a –12 penalty). The save against the
spell is Fortitude → Willpower → Resistance.

132


Discordance: d10—Occult—Afflict

Description: [Inst / Creature]: A bolt of chaotic force
swirls                            outward to envelop the target, causing a lack of
harmony between mind and body, resulting in severe
disorientation and severely slowed actions. The target
takes its next action last in the round (battle phase 5,
initiative 1). The save against the spell is Fortitude →
Willpower → Resistance.

Loop ime: d10—Occult—Afflict

Description: [M / Creature]: The caster warps time,
forcing                                the target to repeat the last action taken. If the
last action was an attack, and nobody is still in the
exact spot where it was made, it’s an automatic waste
of effort. Likewise, if the target’s last action was to
drink a potion, but that potion is used up, he is forced
to repeat the action without the benefit. Other
consequences are at the discretion of the GM. The
afflicted may make a saving throw each round that the
status effect is maintained, and success ends the
condition.

Matter Fusion: d10—Occult -Modify

Description: [M / Object] This spell allows the caster
to                                fuse the physical properties of two chosen objects
into a single, new entity with combined features. For
example, fusing two swords could result in a double-
edged weapon that embodies the traits of both
original swords. The caster may maintain the fusion
for an indefinite period, or opt to reverse it with a
subsequent casting. Both the concentration required
and the risk of adverse outcomes remain high.Limits
on size and weight of the objects depend on the
caster’s level, ranging from Miniscule objects at Level
1 to Large objects at Level 5, as outlined in the General
Categories of Size and Weights table (see page 251).

Monster Form: d10—Occult—Modify

Description: [M / Self] The caster takes on a fully
monstrous                             form. The creature has a shield DR value of
1, d4 armor, and +1 to potential harm and Perception
rolls. The caster may use the monstrous form to cause
harm, including a ranged attack (player’s choice as to
form of the attack). Threat points are Competence →
Expertise branch +1, and range is 10 × basic tier MV
feet.

Temporal Rift: d10—Occult—Modify

Description: [M / Area] With this spell, the caster
opens                                  a rift in the fabric of time within a designated
area. Affected creatures must pass a Fortitude save,
guided by Willpower and Resilience, or experience a
temporal distortion. Their actions either accelerate or
decelerate by ±3 to initiative, impacting the time
required to complete tasks, initiative rolls, or battle
phases. The rift's duration equals the number of
rounds determined by the caster's Competence →
Expertise ability branch. After the spell's duration
ends, time within the affected area resumes its
regular flow.

Legendary

Alter Age: d12+2—Legendary—Afflict

Description: [Inst / Creature]: The caster temporarily
makes                               the target much younger or older at a dizzying
and terrifying rate. The accelerated aging or
rejuvenation is painful and disorienting due to its
suddenness. The target's skin wrinkles or smooths,
hair turns white or returns to its youthful color, and
their body shrinks or grows to reflect the age
alteration. Clothes and equipment adjust magically to
fit the target's transformed form. The effects of the
spell are temporary and last for 2 rounds. At the end of
the duration (round 2), the target reverts to their

133



original age, experiencing the same disorientation
and                         physical adjustments in reverse.

Blindness: d12—Legendary—Afflict

Description: [M / Creature] Disrupts the sense of
sight.                            Perception checks by the affected creature using
sight automatically fail (at GM’s discretion, it can
compensate for the loss, e.g., relying on hearing may
allow a roll with a –12 penalty). The save against the
spell is Fortitude → Willpower → Resistance.

Demolish: d12—Legendary—Modify
Description: [Inst / Object] The caster focuses on
destroying non-living matter, causing it to break

apart, crumble, or dissolve. The caster can attempt to
destroy an object up to 100 lbs. in weight. The object
must be contained wholly within an area equaling the
ability branch maximum in feet for length and height.
The object can be a door, gate, or other object
standing alone. It works on solid earth or rock
(affecting about a cubic foot). This unusual spell
supersedes the rules for magically lowering object
durability.

Initiative Warp: d12—Legendary—Modify
Description: [Inst / Self or creature] The caster or
chosen                             creature is hastened or slowed during combat
for his or its following action. The caster twists time
to move initiative for the target’s next action by up to
4 in either direction, either faster or slower. The save
against the effect is Fortitude → Willpower →
Resilience if resisted.

Petrify: d12+4—Legendary—Afflict

Description: [M / Creature] This dreaded spell turns
the                           affected creature to stone or some other hard
substance, rendering it immobilized and helpless
until the spell is broken or a saving throw made
(Fortitude → Willpower → Resistance).

Stand Still: d12—Legendary—Activate

Description: [M / Creature] A limited and less
powerful                               version of Time Halt, the spell causes time to
stop at the instant of activation for one creature for as
long as the spell is maintained. The effect stays with
the paralyzed body of the target. There may be some
benefits: projectiles that would hit the affected
creature halt at the point of impact, but hang in
midair. Knocking such projectiles down drops them
harmlessly to the ground. Magic spells cast
specifically at the creature take effect only after the
Standstill spell has ended. Magic not targeting the
creature takes effect immediately but with a delayed
effect on the creature at a standstill. Once Standstill
has ended, physical manifestations of magic spells,
along with halted missiles, resolve their original rolls
and effects

Time Halt: d12+5—Legendary— Activate (5 SP)
Description: [Inst / Special] The magic-wielder
makes                                    time halt for all but himself in the area of effect
(2 × MV in radius), allowing him to perform actions
while the spell is maintained. Within the area of effect
the caster may move freely, manipulate objects, and
cause harm within the scope of the regular rules —
but opponents are defenseless and take damage
directly to passive defense. Any creature entering the
area is immediately frozen in time; likewise,
projectiles halt immediately but hang in midair. Those
looking into the area see only the positions and
actions of those at the very instant of casting and
cannot see the caster moving. Magic spells cast into
the area itself take effect only after the spell has
ended. Once Time Halt has ended, any missile attacks
and magic spells, including damaging bolts of
lightning or explosions frozen in midair as time stops,
resolve their original rolls and effects.

GRIMOIRE


MYSTICISM

Offense Spells

Mystic Assault: d4-d12—Variable—Harm
Description: Mystics wield the Mystic Bolt as their
fundamental offensive spell, channeling inner energy
to                             manifest in various mystical forms, each reflecting
different aspects of their discipline and intent. These
manifestations include:

Kinetic Bolt: A shimmering bolt that delivers
concussive force, visibly distorting the air.

Psychic Bolt: An almost invisible wave that pierces the
mind, causing mental anguish.

Shadow Bolt: A tendril of darkness that saps vitality,
inducing                                 a chilling effect.

Mystic Bolt can be enhanced and modified with the
following variations:

Range and Dimensions

Maximum Range: Calculated as (Competence →
Expertise MV) × 4 feet. If a Mastery Die is used, the
range is doubled.

Mystic Bolt: A 1-foot diameter bolt that targets a
single enemy.

Mystic Stream: A continuous stream of energy, 2 feet
in                             width and (Competence → Expertise MV) × 4 feet in
length.

Mystic Burst: An area-of-effect attack with a radius
of                                  (2 × Competence → Expertise MV) + Wizardry
bonuses in feet. Mastery Die doubles the area of effect.

Threat Points and Challenge Die

Basic Cast of Mystic Bolt: The basic cast of Mystic Bolt
(or                             Eldritch Bolt) does not require a challenge die and
inflicts harm based on the caster's Competence →
Expertise (+ Wizardry or Theurgy) roll, making it
accessible for novice mystics.

Challenge Die and Threat Point Increase: To increase
the                              threat points of the spell, the caster can introduce
a challenge die. The initial increase is always to a d4
challenge die, which adds +1 to the threat points. Each
subsequent increase in the challenge die (d6, d8, d10,
d12) raises the threat points by an additional +1. For
example, a d6 challenge die adds +2 to the threat
points, a d8 adds +3, and so on.

Mystic Stream (Challenge d6): Increases the
Challenge                                Die by one step (e.g., d4 to d6) and requires
a maintenance penalty of -1 per additional round.

Threat Points increase by +2 per round.

Mystic Burst (Challenge d8/d10): Converts the spell to
affect an area. At d8, it becomes an area explosion
affecting multiple enemies, while at d10, the burst’s
radius and damage increase significantly.

Afflictions

Mystics can apply one affliction to their attack, which
directly impacts the target. Each affliction increases
the Challenge Die and requires additional Spirit
Points.

Mystic Disorientation (Challenge d4): Disrupts the
target's                               mind, causing confusion and reducing their
initiative by one battle phase (e.g., reducing Prowess
from d10 to d8). The effect can intensify, increasing
the difficulty by +1 per additional phase reduced. This
affliction lasts one round unless otherwise specified.

Mystic Confusion (Challenge d6): Leaves the target
struggling                              to focus, disrupting concentration. If in
close combat, the target may trigger an opportunity
attack unless using a tactical withdrawal. The target is
unable to attack until the same battle phase in the
following round, but may still move or assist others.
This effect typically lasts one round.

Mystic Terror (Challenge d8): Strikes the target with
intense fear, preventing them from attacking the
mystic and forcing them to flee until the next battle
phase. If others block their escape, the target may
attack them to escape, unless they succeed on a

136


Fortitude → Willpower save to avoid harming allies.
This                              effect lasts one round unless otherwise specified.
Mystic Overload (Challenge d10+1): Overwhelms the

target’s senses with psychic energy, inducing

confusion or fear. These intangible attacks bypass
physical                           defenses, affecting the target’s mental and
emotional state directly. Competence → Perception
checks automatically fail with a potential -5 penalty
to compensate, and attacks suffer a -4 penalty to
potential harm. Effects typically last one round unless
otherwise specified, and specialized magical defenses
or heightened perception may be required to resist or
counter this effect

Defense Spells

Arcane Shielding (d4 to d12 — Common —
Protect)

The mystic conjures a protective barrier of psychic
energy                              that envelops the target, deflecting incoming
threats before they can inflict harm. This shield
manifests as a semi-transparent energy field, often
appearing as dark tendrils or shimmering distortions
that warp reality around the target.

Shielding Effect: Reduces incoming threat points by
an amount equal to the Challenge Die rank. For
example, a d4 reduces threat by 1, a d6 reduces by 2,
and so on, up to a maximum reduction of 5 at d12.

Maintenance: The caster may maintain the shield, but
incurs a cumulative –1 penalty to other actions for
each additional round it is sustained.

Spirit Point (SP) Cost: Each casting requires 1 SP per
rank of the Challenge Die. A d4 costs 1 SP, d6 costs 2
SP, and so on, up to 5 SP for d12.

Interaction with Physical Shields: If the target uses a
physical shield, combine threat reductions, divide by
2, and round up.

Arcane Armor (d4 to d12 — Common — Protect)
Through                                sheer force of will, the mystic envelops the
target in a layer of protective energy that fortifies
them after active defenses are breached. This armor
adapts to threats, providing resilience against
physical and magical harm. Variations include:

Psychic Armor: Reinforces the mind and body,
reducing                         damage from mental and physical attacks.
Shadow Armor: Wraps the target in shadows,

absorbing and dispersing incoming damage.

Ethereal Armor: Glows with otherworldly light,
shielding against supernatural threats.

Armor Effect: Provides Damage Reduction (DR) equal
to                               the Challenge Die rank. For example, a d4 version
provides +1 DR, d6 adds +2 DR, and so on, up to a
maximum of +4 DR at d10. The DR applies after the
target’s active defense is depleted.

Maintenance: Maintaining this magical armor requires
concentration, with the caster incurring a –1 penalty
to other actions per additional round it is sustained.

Spirit Point (SP) Cost: Each casting requires 1 SP per
rank of the Challenge Die. A d4 costs 1 SP, d6 costs 2
SP, and so on, up to 5 SP for d12.

Interaction with Physical Armor:

If Mystic Armor's DR Die is Higher: Use the mystic
armor's DR.

If Physical Armor's DR Die is Higher: Use the physical
armor's                                 DR.

If Mystic Armor's DR Die is Lower: Add +1 DR per die
rank of the armor spell to the physical armor's DR.
Versatility of Mysticism Defense:

Mystics wield Arcane Shielding and Arcane Armor to
adapt to various threats by either bolstering their
defensive capabilities with robust barriers or
enhancing their resilience against sustained damage.
In addition to these, Mystics can conjure Arcane Walls
to establish broader protective measures on the
battlefield.

137


GRIMOIRE


Arcane Walls
Types      of Walls:

Flame Wall: Blocks physical and ranged attacks,
dealing                          minor fire damage to those who attempt to
pass through without proper resistance.

Wind Wall: Deflects projectiles and disperses gas-
based                           attacks, providing partial cover against ranged
threats.

Shadow Veil: Creates an area of darkness, reducing
visibility                          and granting concealment to allies within.
Challenge Die and SP Cost:

Similar to Arcane Shielding and Arcane Armor, the
potency                                  of Arcane Walls scales with the Challenge Die
rank selected during casting. Each type may have
specific modifiers based on its elemental nature.

Maintenance:

Maintaining an Arcane Wall requires concentration,
incurring                            a –1 penalty to other actions for each
additional round it is sustained.

Customization:

Mystics can combine different elemental walls to
create                             hybrid defenses, offering tailored protection
against diverse threats.

Common

Confusion: d4—Common—Afflict

Description: [M / Creature or Area] This spell confuses
the                              target or targets within the area of effect, making
them uncertain of their actions. Those affected roll at
–1 per level of the caster on their next action. Casting
Modifiers: one creature is challenge die d4; +1 added
to challenge die per additional creature affected

Detect Magic: d4—Common—Activate
Description: [M / Area] This spell allows the caster to
detect                                  any magical auras within the area of effect,
revealing the presence of any enchanted or cursed

objects or creatures. It functions exactly as does
Identify                            Magic (qv), except that it is a path spell for a
mystic, who can augment it with a mastery die

Ethereal Sight: d4—Common—Activate
Description: [M / Self] [M / Self] This spell bestows
the                                    caster with the temporary ability to perceive into
the ethereal plane, within a radius determined by the
caster's Competence → Awareness ability branch. The
range begins at 15 feet at level 1 and increases by 5 feet
per additional level. For the purpose of this spell,
'ethereal' encompasses both energy-based entities
like limbo spirits and traditionally invisible or
incorporeal beings such as specific types of ghosts.

This means the caster can identify both kinds of
ethereal beings within the spell's effective range..

Levitation: d4—Common—Activate

Description: [M / Creature] The caster causes the
target                              to levitate up to 10 feet above the ground and
remain in mid-air. The target can move in any
direction, but cannot exceed the maximum height.
The target cannot take any other actions while
levitating, and the spell lasts for up to 1 minute.

138


Mindfulness: d4—Common—Modify
Description: [M/ Self] This spell clears the caster's
mind, allowing them to focus more intently on a

particular task. It temporarily boosts the caster's next
action, providing +1 to Competence or empathy
related ability tests.

Phase Shift: d4—Common—Activate
Description: [M / Self] The caster transitions into a
temporary ethereal state, enabling them to move
through solid objects for a limited duration. This
duration lasts for a number of rounds equal to the

caster's total MV in the relevant ability branch; each
round consists of 10 seconds. To calculate the spell's
total duration in minutes, simply divide (MV × 10) by

60. Be aware that magically fortified objects—such as
enchanted doors, gates, or walls specifically designed
to block or detect ethereal entities—can disrupt the
spell's effectiveness, necessitating a re-roll of the
challenge die. The complexity of the magical
enchantment dictates the re-roll: a basic ward may
require a d6, while a more potent blockage demands a
d8.

Silence: d4—Common—Modify

Description: [M / Area] This spell muffles all normal
sound                             within the area of effect, creating an almost
completely silent zone. Any attempts to make noise
within the area are at a disadvantage, adding +1 to the
challenge die. The area of effect is a circle (sphere) of
feet diameter equal to the caster’s Competence →
Expertise MV x2 + Wizardry bonus

Soothing Balm: d4—Common—Restore
Description: [M / Creature] The caster invokes a
healing                                spell that coats the target with a mystical
balm, restoring health equal to the caster's MV in
either the Competence or Expertise ability branch—
whichever the caster chooses. Simultaneously, the

spell imbues the target with a soothing effect, making
them                            temporarily immune to fear-based influences
for a duration of one round per caster level. Casting
Modifiers: The base challenge die for affecting a
single creature is a d4. For each additional target, add

+1 to the challenge die.

Soothing Mists: d4—Common—Restore
Description: [M / Creature] A mist envelops a
creature,                                soothing its wounds. Health recovery
depends on the caster's Competence MV or Expertise
MV, at the caster's discretion. Casting Modifiers: A d4
challenge die applies to one creature. For each
additional hit point restored, increase the challenge
die by +1. Choice of Defense: At the time of casting, the
caster may decide whether the healing replenishes the
active or passive defense pool.

Uncommon

Discern Soul: d6—Uncommon—Activate
Description: [Inst / Creature] The mystic draws upon
preternatural vision to sense the nature of the target’s
essential self. The spell reveals an aura around the
target,                                 seen only by the mystic, granting some limited
information about personality and spiritual
characteristics.

The aura radiates 2–3 feet from the body, and has a
predominant color. White: tending toward goodness
or order, a potential ally. Black: tending toward evil or
chaos, a potential enemy. Violet: tending toward
neutrality, intentions variable. Blue: otherworldly,
preternatural, or supernatural. Colorless: shielded

Mind Shield: d6—Uncommon—Activate
Description: [M / Self] This spell blocks any power
that                                  allows another creature to read the mystic’s
mind. The caster is protected from an attempt to pry
into thoughts or memories so long as it is maintained.

139


GRIMOIRE


Those attempting to read the mind of one so shielded
know                             they are being blocked by magic. However, the
spell does not work if the mystic’s passive defense is
brought to zero by other magical attacks.

Object Read: d6—Uncommon—Activate.
Description                                 [M / Object]: This spell allows the caster
to explore an object's historical imprint. It reveals a
montage of past events related to the object, be they
mundane or extraordinary. While a specific query may
demand a more difficult roll, even a failed attempt at
specificity will grant the user a general sense of the
object's history.

Mind Blade: d6—Uncommon—Harm
Description: [Inst / Creature] The Mystic channels
mental energy into a shimmering blade, inflicting
harm equal to their Wizardry rank +2. The blade is

visible but can pass through solid objects at a cost of 2
spirit points, potentially enabling surprise attacks.

See Aura: d6—Uncommon—Activate

Description: [M / Self] The mystic can see the psychic
aura                                of a person or object. This spell reveals different
information than Discern Soul. It shows a general
state of health, such as sick, weary, or wounded. A roll
of 20 or better can determine the type of being, e.g.,
human, dwarf, elf, from aura alone. It shows the
presence of magic, and on a roll of 24 or better can
distinguish the type of magic present.

See Invisible: d6—Uncommon—Activate
Description: [M / Self] Can see creatures and objects
hidden                                   by an invisibility spell or power. If a person’s
or creature’s invisibility is due to their own spell or
power, roll an opposed roll to determine if See
Invisible penetrates the invisibility. Casting modifier:

+2 to make normal visual checks against hidden or
concealed creatures and objects in addition.

Sense Power: d6—Uncommon—Activate
Description: [Inst / Creature] Grants the mystic
insight                                     into the target creature’s level of threat. The
GM may tell the player whether the target creature is a
minor, standard, exceptional, or legendary threat.

Sixth Sense: d6—Uncommon—Activate
Description: [M / Self] This spell gives the mystic the
ability                                   to sense danger and to navigate in unfamiliar
surroundings. It grants a +2 on all rolls to respond to
perceived danger or avoid simple or total surprise.

Usually, this involves the Competence → Perception
branch,                            either opposed to Competence → Adroitness if
being stalked, or against a challenge die based on the
nature of the surroundings (GM’s call).

Esoteric

Cosmic Shift: d8—Esoteric—Modify

Description: [M / Self] The caster can bend space and
time                                to his or her will, allowing him or her to move
faster, dodge attacks with ease, and even teleport
short distances (one yard per level). The spell provides
a d6 bonus to active defense for the duration of the
spell. Casting Modifiers: Increase the challenge die by

+1 to teleport 3 yards further or to make the spell last 3
rounds after ceasing to maintain it.

Fathom: d8—Esoteric—Activate

Description: [Inst / Self] Casting this spell allows the
mystic instantaneous, intuitive insight into how to
resolve a puzzle, dilemma, or riddle impeding the
progress of a quest or mission. Failing the casting
means the mystic intuits nothing new and
understands the spell was a failure. Success means the
GM can grant some clues to help the players when
stuck.

Mind Read: d8—Esoteric—Activate

140


Description: [M / Creature] By activating this spell,
the                               caster gains access to the surface thoughts and
current emotional state of the target. This allows for
better detection of deceit. Each probe into thoughts or
emotions permits the target a series of saving throws
(Fortitude → Willpower → Resistance), even if the
spell maintains its effect.

Mystic Lore: d8—Esoteric—Activate

Description: [Inst / Self] Information relevant to the
adventuring party’s plans manifests in the caster’s
mind. The GM gives the mystic a hint about a curious
person, creature, place, or thing pertinent to the
situation. It can be used to solve riddles or to help one
figure out serious dilemmas. A failed roll brings no
added information to mind whatsoever.

Premonition: d8—Esoteric—Activate
Description: [M / Self] The mystic gains some hint
about impending danger or risks associated with
current plans or intended actions. The premonition
comes in symbolic imagery, or sometimes
interpretable visions, at the GM’s discretion. The
premonition cannot extend beyond the possible
consequence                                 of the action, plan, or intention
imagined. Premonitions do not show outcomes but
give an idea of the level of danger or range of
possibilities.

Psychic Beacon: d8—Esoteric—Activate
Description: [M / Area] A psychic lure comes into
being,                              capturing the attention of all creatures within a
specific radius. The lure can serve to divert enemies or
set up an ambush. Its effective radius equals 1 yard per
point of the caster's ability branch, doubled for
mastery levels. Intelligent or wary creatures like
goblins, orcs, or woodland animals may attempt a
valorous saving throw (Fortitude → Endurance →
Vitality or Resilience) to resist its pull. If the spell
targets a specific species or genus (e.g., orcs,

goblins), the saving throw suffers a -1 penalty per
caster level.

Reassemble: d8—Esoteric—Modify

Description [Inst / Object]: A broken, potentially
complex                           structure or mechanical device is restored to
full function. Targeted objects will be repaired, even
if broken apart and missing parts. Missing parts will
manifest out of thin air if small and non-magical in
nature.

Shadow Walk: d8—Esoteric—Activate

Description: [Inst / Special] Description: [M /
Special]                                This spell lets the caster step into any nearby
shadow, even one cast by objects or creatures close
by, along with all items normally worn and carried,

141


GRIMOIRE


and instantly jump to an adjoining shadow. In this
state,                              the caster can walk within the shadow at up to
twice his normal speed, and jump to adjoining
shadows no more than six feet distant.

If a bright light source chases away the shadow in
which                                the caster is concealed, he is thrown back to the
light source’s border. In a pitch-black room, the
caster can will himself to any point in the room
without taking a step (if able to see in shadow). The
shadow walker is not impervious to physical threats
(see Form of Night), and can only jump from one
shadow to another once per round while maintaining
the spell. The caster can also position himself for a
surprise attack, materializing within a creature’s
shadow and simultaneously attacking, gaining simple
surprise on that round. Perception rolls used to detect
the recipient are at –4

Occult

Continuous Shadow: d10—Occult—Modify
Description: [M / Area] The spell creates an area of
dim                              shadow through which only the caster can see
clearly. Others succeeding with a Perception roll can
attack anyone in the area of effect (2x Competence →
Expertise MV + Wizardry or Theurgy Bonus MV,
radius) at a penalty of –4. Failure means the attacker
is striking blind, at a penalty of –8. A Continuous
Shadow spell can be used as the source of shadow for
all spells that use shadows.

Dreamwalk: d10—Occult—Activate
Description: [M / Creature] The caster enters the
dreams                                of a sleeping creature. Upon a successful

casting roll, the caster forces it into a dream state if it
is                                not already dreaming. The caster may influence the
dreams, bringing new elements into play (shifting
landscapes, conditions, creatures, and places),
conjuring up creatures or events suited to the

interaction’s aims. Any stressful event or scary
phenomenon                                so manifested grants the sleeper a
Fortitude → Willpower → Resistance saving throw to
awaken, else he or she takes psychic threat points
equal to the caster’s initial roll. A successful save
means the target immediately wakes, but failing
forces him or her to remain asleep for another round,
after which another attempt can be made. The caster
cannot simultaneously extract memories to use
against the target in dreams with this power, but
some mythic variations that enable this are spoken of
by sages. There is a 10% chance per non-damaging
use of either 1) inducing a future positive or negative
reaction to something or someone (via dream
symbolism, leaving no magical traces of influence), or

2) extracting some useful information, although this

will be wrapped in dream symbolism (the GM should
invent                            allusions and puzzles to suit).The caster
chooses the effect.

Ethereal Projection: d10—Occult— Modify
Description: [M / Creature or Self] The caster can
project                                   his or her consciousness outside the body,
exploring the world in a spectral form. While in this
state, the caster can move through solid objects, fly,
and access inaccessible places. Casting Modifiers:
Increase the challenge die by +1 to project the
consciousness of an additional creature or increase
the spell’s duration make the spell last 3 rounds after
ceasing to maintain it.

Foreknowledge: d10—Occult—Activate
Description: [M / Self] This spell, a more powerful
version                                    of Sixth Sense, gives the mystic the ability to
sense danger and to navigate in unfamiliar
surroundings. It grants a +6 on all rolls to respond to
perceived danger or avoid simple or total surprise.

Usually, this involves the Competence → Perception
branch,                           either opposed to Competence → Adroitness if

142


being stalked, or against a challenge die based on the
nature of the surroundings (GM’s call). A caster who
maintains the spell also gets an automatic roll to
detect ambushes, even if the assailants are invisible
and silent.

Manipulate Shadow: d10—Occult—Harm, Afflict
Description: [Inst / Creature] This spell gives physical
substance                               to an area of shadow that animates and can
be manipulated into many forms to make a
devastating attack or to capture and hold a targeted
enemy. Range is 10 × basic tier MV in feet. An attack on
the target causes threat points equal to the caster’s
roll. The attack manifests physically and visibly as
coalesced shadow and can be blocked with a shield,
avoided with active defense, or absorbed by armor.

Alternatively, the shadow form can be made to wrap
around                                  a target and hold it fast, like tendrils of
shadowy steel, rendering it unable to move or attack
so long as the spell is maintained. The one captured
may make a Fortitude roll to break free, and can make
limited attempts to defend at one-half active defense

Release Mind: d10—Occult—Activate
Description: [Inst / Creature] The mystic grants the
target creature power to release itself from a mind-

bending magical affliction. The target creature gets an
immediate saving throw, using either the caster’s
ability branch or its own Fortitude → Willpower
branch, whichever is higher.

Legendary

Control Humanoid: d12—Legendary—Afflict
Description: [M / Creature] This spell lets the caster
control                               the mind of one humanoid creature. The
victim’s mind is taken over, the caster’s thoughts
insinuated into the brain, changing opinions or
perceptions. The target creature’s mind is bent to the

caster’s will, so the creature will follow instructions,
even                          attacking allies. However, it will not harm itself.
The target creature gets a Fortitude → Willpower →
Resistance save against the spell

Form of Night: d12—Legendary—Activate
Description: [Inst / Special] This spell turns the caster
into                               shadow stuff, along with all items normally worn
and carried. The caster can step into and completely
merge with any nearby shadow, even one cast by
objects or creatures close by. In this state, the caster
can travel within the shadow, moving up to twice his
normal running speed, and jump to adjoining
shadows no more than six feet distant. If a bright light
source chases away the shadow in which the caster is
concealed, he stays in shadow form but is thrown back
to the light source’s border.

If the light source obliterates all shadow, then the
caster                                is jolted back into his normal form and blinded
for a round. In a pitch-black room, the caster can will
himself to merge without taking a step and can travel
to any part of the room. In shadow state, the caster is
impervious to all normal or preternatural physical
threat points. He may still cast spells. This will not
reveal him, although the direction of the activation
energy source might be detected. The caster can also
position himself for a surprise attack, materializing
within a creature’s shadow and simultaneously
attacking, gaining total surprise on that round.

Perception rolls used to detect the recipient are at –5.
One cannot activate this spell and rematerialize in the
same round.

In shadow state, the caster is impervious to all
normal                                 or preternatural physical threat points. He
may still cast spells. This will not reveal him, although
the direction of the activation energy source might be
detected. The caster can also position himself for a

143


GRIMOIRE


bonus to surprise on that round. Perception rolls used
to                             detect the recipient are at –5. One cannot activate
this spell and rematerializes in the same round.

Hypnotic Suggestion: d12—Legendary—Afflict
Description: [Inst / Creature] The caster can place a
command                               or insinuate an idea into the mind of
another, leading to actions that seem rational to the
victim. Commands should be short. An additional roll
to save is allowed when the suggested action is to be
completed. Once the action is complete, the spell’s
compunction wears off. The save is against Fortitude

→ Willpower → Resistance

Induce Sleep: d12—Legendary—Afflict
Description: [Inst / Creature] The spell makes the
victim                               fall asleep even if not tired. The victim rolls

versus Fortitude → Willpower → Resistance to remain
awake. Failing the roll means the victim remains
asleep for rounds equal to a roll of the caster’s
Competence rank die (d4 to d12) or until awakened

Mind Control: d12+4—Legendary—Afflict (4 SP)
Description: [M / Creature] This spell lets the caster
infiltrate                                   and control the mind of any sentient
targeted creature, overwhelming its will. The afflicted
creature follows any command short of suicide, even
if it harms allies, so long as language or general intent
is understood. The power can continue to dominate a
mind once out of sight. The subject may make a saving
throw each round, versus Fortitude → Willpower →
Resistance. Success ends the condition, regardless of
distance

Super Intuition: d12—Legendary—Activate
Description: [M / Self] This spell grants a mystic the
intuitive sense, the better to notice things in
dangerous                                   or challenging situations. It is a non-visual
form of premonition, like a tingling sensation or

general feeling of warning that increases the caster’s
Perception base die rank by 3 steps. If the Perception
base rank is already d12, then increase rolls by +3.

DIVINE MAGIC

Hieraticism

Offense Spells

Dvine Assault: d4-d12—Variable— Harm
Description: Hieraticists wield the Divine Bolt as their
universal offensive spell within the Hieraticism
manifestation, channeling divine power to deliver
righteous judgment and harm their adversaries. This
spell                                 can manifest in various divine forms, each
reflecting the nature of the invoked deity or divine
force:

Radiant Bolt: Shines with blinding light, scorching
enemies                              with holy fire.

Entropic Bolt: Crackles with dark energy, accelerating
decay                             and undermining the target's vitality.

Condemnation Bolt: Resonates with the sound of
divine                            judgment, striking fear and pain into the hearts
of the wicked.

The Divine Bolt spell can be enhanced and modified
with                            the following variations:

Range and Dimensions

Maximum Range: Calculated as (Competence →
Expertise MV) × 4 feet.

Divine Bolt: A 1-foot diameter bolt that strikes a
single target with precision.

Divine Stream: A continuous stream of divine energy
with                               a width of 2 feet and a length equal to
(Competence → Expertise MV) × 4 feet.

144


Divine Burst: An area-of-effect attack with a radius
equal                              to (2 × Competence → Expertise MV) + Theurgy
bonuses in feet.

Potential Harm and Challenge Die

Basic Cast of Divine Bolt: The basic cast of Divine Bolt
does                                 not require a challenge die and inflicts harm
based on the caster's Competence → Expertise (+
Theurgy) roll, making it accessible for novice
hieraticists.

Challenge Die and Threat Point Increase: To increase
the                              threat points of the spell, the caster can introduce
a challenge die. The initial increase is always to a d4
challenge die, which adds +1 to the threat points. Each
subsequent increase in the challenge die (d6, d8, d10,
d12) raises the threat points by an additional +1. For
example, a d6 challenge die adds +2 to the threat
points, a d8 adds +3, and so on.

Divine Stream (Challenge d6): Increases the
Challenge                                Die by one step (e.g., d4 to d6) and requires
a maintenance penalty of -1 per additional round.

Threat Points increase by +2 per round.

Divine Burst (Challenge d8): Converts the spell to
affect                                 an area. The burst becomes an area explosion
affecting multiple enemies, with its radius and
damage determined by the formula (2 × Competence →
Expertise MV) + Theurgy bonuses in feet.

Afflictions

Hieraticists can apply one affliction to their attack,
which                         directly impacts the target. Each affliction
increases the Challenge Die and requires additional
Spirit Points.

Afflictions Breakdown

Divine Blindness (Challenge d4): Strikes the target
with                             blinding light, impairing their ability to see. The
target's perception is severely reduced, and attacks
suffer a penalty to potential harm. This effect typically
lasts for one round unless otherwise specified.

Divine Decay (Challenge d6): Channels entropic
energy,                          accelerating decay and weakening the target's
vitality. The target's resilience is reduced, making
them more vulnerable to subsequent attacks. This
effect lasts for one round unless specified otherwise.

Divine Fear (Challenge d8): Resonates with the sound
of                              divine judgment, instilling fear in the target. The
target is unable to attack the hieraticist and is forced
to retreat until the next battle phase. If others block
their escape, the target may attack them in an attempt
to flee, unless they succeed on a Fortitude →
Willpower save. This effect lasts for one round unless
otherwise specified.

Divine Overwhelm (Challenge d10+1): Overwhelms
the                              target’s senses with divine energy, inducing
confusion or fear. These intangible attacks bypass
physical defenses, affecting the target’s mental and
emotional state directly. Competence → Perception
checks automatically fail with a potential -5 penalty
to compensate, and attacks suffer a -4 penalty to
potential harm. Effects typically last one round unless
otherwise specified, and specialized magical defenses
or heightened perception may be required to resist or
counter this effect

Defense Spells

Hieraticists construct their defenses with Divine
Shield                                and Divine Armor, both channeling celestial
power to protect the caster or allies. The strength of
these spells scales with the Challenge Die rank chosen
during casting.

Divine Shield (d4 to d12 — Common — Protect)
Description: The theurgist conjures a radiant shield
that                             surrounds the target, deflecting incoming threats.
It embodies the deity's safeguarding embrace and can
take various forms:

Shield of Light: A glowing barrier of pure energy that
repels attacks.

145


GRIMOIRE


Sacred Barrier: A shimmering shield adorned with
celestial symbols that turns aside blows.

Warding Aura: A divine presence that envelops the
target, deterring enemies.

Effect: Reduces incoming threat points by an amount
equal                             to the Challenge Die rank.

Spirit Point (SP) Cost: 1 SP per die rank (e.g., d4 costs 1
SP, d6 costs 2 SP).

Maintenance: Requires concentration, incurring a
penalty of -1 per die rank to other actions for each
additional round.

Interaction with Physical Shields: Combine threat
reductions from both shields, divide by 2, round up.

Divine Armor (d4 to d12 — Common — Protect)
Description: The theurgist envelops the target in
protective                                divine energy, fortifying them after active
defenses are breached. This armor represents the
enduring protection of the deity and adapts to
different threats:

Celestial Armor: Shines with ethereal light, absorbing
damage.

Sacred Vestments: Appears as glowing garments,
shielding                              the wearer.

Divine Mantle: A divine cloak that mitigates incoming
attacks.

Effect: Provides Damage Reduction (DR) equal to the
Challenge Die rank (e.g., roll d4 for DR if d4 rank is
used).

Spirit Point (SP) Cost: 1 SP per die rank (e.g., d4 costs 1
SP, d6 costs 2 SP).

Maintenance: Requires concentration, incurring a
penalty of -1 per die rank to other actions for each
additional round.

Interaction with Physical Armor: Use the higher DR
between Divine Armor and physical armor. If Divine
Armor's DR is lower, add +1 per rank of the armor
spell to the physical DR.

Divine Walls

Hieraticists can also create Divine Walls to provide
battlefield                            control and additional protection.

Types of Walls:

Flame Wall: Blocks physical attacks, dealing minor fire
damage to those attempting to pass.

Wind Wall: Deflects projectiles and disperses gas-
based threats.

Shadow Veil: Creates an area of darkness, reducing
visibility                         and granting concealment to allies.

Challenge Die and SP Cost: Scales with Challenge Die
rank, similar to Divine Shield and Divine Armor.

Maintenance: Requires concentration, with a penalty
of                               -1 per die rank to other actions for each additional
round.

Customization: Hieraticists can combine different
types                                 of Divine Walls to create hybrid defenses tailored
to specific threats

undead up to minor power level; at levels 3-4, up to

standard power level; and at level 5, up to exceptional
power                            level. The spell lasts for a number of rounds

Description: [M / Object] The priest imbues the area
of                                 effect with holy energy, consecrating the ground.

aura                                  that restores health to all creatures within a
radius determined by the caster's level. The health
restored equals the ability test roll, with a minimum
of 2 defense points restored. The radius extends 5 feet
per caster level. Casting modifiers apply: +1 per
creature affected over the caster level; extra creatures
beyond this limit receive only +1 defense point.

Banish Undead: d6—Uncommon—Destroy
Description: [M / Creature] The caster channels divine
energy                                   to banish a single undead target within short
range. The spell affects undead up to minor power
level at levels 1-2, standard at 3-4, and exceptional at
level 5. It destroys the target if its maximum primary
attack roll is less than or equal to the caster's ability
test roll. Intelligent undead are entitled to a saving
throw.

Blessing of Health: d6—Uncommon— Restore
Description: [Inst / Creature] The priest invokes the
blessings                               of his or her deity, restoring a target’s
health by an amount equal to the ability test roll. This
spell can cure diseases, poisons, and any other
afflictions that cause harm to the target’s health

Dispel Magic: d6 (Variable)—Uncommon—Modify
Description: [Inst / Object or Creature] The priest
dispels                               any one active magical effect on the target
object or creature. The die rank of the challenge roll is
equal to the die rank of the spell or effect being
dispelled. Casting Modifiers: +2 to the challenge die
per additional effect to be dispelled

Nullify Poison: d6 (Variable)—Uncommon—Restore
Description: [Inst / Object or Creature] This spell
renders                          poison harmless. Cast upon a bottled poison,
or a poisoned victim, it will nullify the effects of the

147


GRIMOIRE


poison if a challenge roll is successful. The GM sets
the                             difficulty based on the strength of the poison. It
will not restore damage, and casting it on a poisonous
creature will not neutralize its venom

Recovery of the Unready: d6—Uncommon—
Restore

Description: [Inst / Creature] This spell restores
damage                           to flesh and bone. The recipient’s passive
defense is restored by the amount rolled.

Soothe Ally: d6—Common—Restore

Description: [M /
Creature]           The theurgist
restores a single
creature’s spirit points
by a number equal to
the ability test roll

Soul Transfer: d6—
Uncommon—Restore (2
SP)

Description: [M /
Creature]            The theurgist
performs a ritual to
transfer the soul of a
deceased creature into a
focus object, such as a
gem or amulet. The
focus object must

remain intact for the spell's duration. The challenge
roll                                  is a d6, with an additional cost of 2 Spirit Points
due to the spell's manipulation of fundamental forces.
The spell can be maintained as a ritual, allowing the
theurgist to bypass action penalties. The ritual's
duration equals the time spent in unbroken casting,
and the caster gains a +2 bonus to the casting roll for
every additional ten minutes spent, up to +5. The spell

fizzles if the focus object breaks or if the caster fails a
Fortitude → Willpower save during a renewal ritual.

Esoteric

Doomsday Premonition: d8—Esoteric— Activate

Description: [M / Self or Creature] The spell grants a

+3 bonus on all ability tests directly related to
survival,                            navigation, or avoiding danger. While
maintaining the spell, the caster incurs a -3 penalty to
all ability tests. However, if the spell is cast on
themselves, this penalty does not apply to tests
directly related to the areas of premonition (survival,

navigation, avoiding danger).
The            maximum duration
equals the caster's
Competence → Expertise +
Wizardry or Theurgy bonus
maximum MV score in rounds.
Concentration checks are
required for durations beyond
this limit, with a target
number based on the spell's -
3 maintenance penalty.

Mystical Regeneration:

The           priest channels divine

energy to heal a creature's

wounds. The spell restores health points to the target

gains a regeneration effect, restoring up to a
maximum of +3 health points at the start of each turn.
This regeneration continues for as long as the spell is
maintained by the caster.

148


Rejuvenate: d8—Esoteric—Restore

Description: [Inst / Creature] This spell focuses on
restoring                                 the recipient's active defense by the amount
rolled on the ability test. It specifically targets
muscles and tendons to relieve tension and improve
mobility.

Remove Curse: d8—Esoteric—Restore
Description: [Inst / Creature or Object] This spell
removes                                an existing curse on an object or creature.
Roll this ability branch versus the initial roll of the
curse: it must exceed that roll to break it.

Unbind Spirit: d8—Esoteric—Activate
Description                              [Inst / Area]: The priest invokes a
supernatural force to unbind cursed spirits from a
particular place or object. This spell is often used to
unbind spirits bound to a certain area by a curse,
allowing them to depart into the next phase of their
ghostly existence. The caster’s ability branch roll
must exceed the initial roll of the curse than bound
the spirits to unbind them.

Occult

Desolate Curse: d10 (Ritual)—Occult—Destroy
Description: [Special / Creature] The priest invokes a
powerful curse that causes the target to wither and
decay rapidly. The target must make a successful
ability test roll to avoid being afflicted with a
debilitating sickness that deals ongoing damage to its
passive defense and physical attributes. The curse
lasts                                for a number of days equal to the theurgist’s
ability test roll or until it is removed through magical
means, and inflicts 1d4 passive damage per day.

Entreat Entity: d10—Occult—Activate
Description: [Inst / Special] In times of danger, the
theurgist can use this spell to call upon his patron

deity for a favor. The effects are random, depending
on                                 the petitioned god’s whim, or the circumstances as
determined by the GM (with narrative input
encouraged from the player). Other extemporaneous
variations are possible. Failure tends to have more
severe consequences than the Supernatural
Intervention feat of a priest

Omniscient Eye: d10—Occult—Modify
Description: [M / Creature] The theurgist channels
the                                  power of his or her deity to grant the target
unparalleled insight and knowledge. The target gains
the ability to see and understand things beyond
normal perception, such as magical auras, hidden
doors, and invisible creatures. Its Competence →
Perception branch ranks are raised by 1 per caster
level for the spell’s duration (or +1 once at d12 or +5).

Soul Transmutation: d10 (Ritual)—Occult— Modify
Description: [M / Creature] The priest conducts a
ritual to transfer the soul of a willing creature into a
new body, which must be of the same species and
prepared in advance. Upon successful transference,
the target may experience temporary disorientation.
To maintain the soul in the new body, the target must
wear a phylactery prepared through means of
Arcanum. The new body is not immortal, and so age of
the deceased host matters, and the host must not have
been dead for more than an hour. The spell can be
dispelled by Dispel Magic or similar effects, severing
the soul once again from the new body, but only if the
phylactery is also destroyed.

Legendary

Create Undead: d12—Legendary—Activate.
Description                                [M / Area]: The priests points at dead

149


GRIMOIRE


from the ground, or even from their graves, to attack
enemies                                upon command or otherwise do the bidding
of the caster. He can choose to create either two 1D8
undead creatures (minor threats) or a single 2D8
(standard threat) undead creature. Monster statistics:
TY: Undead humanoid, TD: 1d8 or 2d8, HP: 8 each or
16, DR: None, ST: 1d8, AB: Agility 1d8

Commune with the Dead: d12—Legendary—
Activate

Description: [M / Self] Allows the caster to question
the                              dead. The dead can relate events of the location’s
past or speak of hidden things. Even when asked
specific questions, their answers can often be vague
and open to interpretation. GMs can apply a
disadvantage or difficulty based on the question.

Failure of the ability roll will yield no answer at all.
Failure to exceed the challenge die will yield wrong
answers!

Regeneration: d12—Legendary—Restore
Description: [M / Special] This spell petitions the
deity,                             pantheon, or powers worshiped to regenerate
lost limbs and body parts. The restoration occurs
instantly when successfully cast by the caster simply
laying hands on the recipient. If healing another
player character’s chosen flaw, the spell also costs the
caster a number of Character Points equal to the value
of the flaw

Summon Spirit: d12—Legendary—Activate.
Description                                [M / Special]: The priest summons a spirit
of the dead, some restless soul resident to the area, or
one dragged from somewhere beyond the veil. A single
2d8 (standard threat) spirit is summoned to do the
bidding of the theurgist. Monster statistics: TY:
Bellicose Spirit, TD: 2d8, HP: 16, DR: None, ST: 2d8,
AB: Agility 1d8, Expertise 1D8.

Druidry

Offense Spells

Nature Assault: d4-d12—Variable— Harm
Description: Druids wield the Nature Bolt as their
universal offensive spell within the Druidry
manifestation, channeling the raw forces of nature to
deliver concentrated harm to their adversaries. This
spell can manifest in various elemental forms, each
reflecting                              the druid's deep connection to the natural
world:

Thorn Bolt: Erupts from the ground, impaling the
target with sharp wooden spikes.

Wind Bolt: Manifests as a sudden gust, buffeting the
target with concussive force.

Water Bolt: Sends a jet of water or mud, potentially
knocking                         the target off balance.

Fire Bolt (for fire-aligned druids): Ignites upon
contact, causing burning damage.

The Nature Bolt spell can be enhanced and modified
with                            the following variations:

Range and Dimensions

Maximum Range: Calculated as (Competence →
Expertise MV) × 4 feet.

Nature Bolt: A 1-foot diameter bolt that strikes a
single target with precision.

Nature Stream: A continuous stream of elemental
energy                         with a width of 2 feet and a length equal to
(Competence → Expertise MV) × 4 feet.

Nature Burst: An area-of-effect attack with a radius
equal                             to (2 × Competence → Expertise MV) + Druidry
bonuses in feet.

Potential Harm and Challenge Die

Basic Cast of Nature Bolt: The basic cast of Nature
Bolt                                does not require a challenge die and inflicts harm

150


based on the caster's Competence → Expertise (+
Druidry)                              roll, making it accessible for novice druids.
Challenge Die and Threat Point Increase: To increase

the threat points of the spell, the caster can introduce

a challenge die. The initial increase is always to a d4
challenge die, which adds +1 to the threat points. Each
subsequent increase in the challenge die (d6, d8, d10,
d12) raises the threat points by an additional +1. For
example, a d6 challenge die adds +2 to the threat
points, a d8 adds +3, and so on.

Nature Stream (Challenge d6): Increases the
Challenge                                Die by one step (e.g., d4 to d6) and requires
a maintenance penalty of -1 per additional round.

Threat Points increase by +2 per round.

Nature Burst (Challenge d8): Converts the spell to
affect                                 an area. The burst becomes an area explosion
affecting multiple enemies, with its radius and
damage determined by the formula (2 × Competence →
Expertise MV) + Druidry bonuses in feet.

Afflictions

Druids can apply one affliction to their attack, which
directly impacts the target. Each affliction increases
the Challenge Die and requires additional Spirit
Points.

Afflictions Breakdown

Nature Entangle (Challenge d4): Strikes the target
with                              thorny vines, ensnaring them and reducing their
mobility. The target's movement speed is reduced,
and attacks suffer a penalty to potential harm. This
effect typically lasts for one round unless otherwise
specified.

Elemental Drench (Challenge d6): Channels water or
mud to disorient the target, potentially knocking
them off balance. The target's resilience is reduced,
making them more vulnerable to subsequent attacks.
This effect lasts for one round unless specified
otherwise.

Elemental Fear (Challenge d8): Resonates with the
chaotic                             forces of nature, instilling fear in the target.
The target is unable to attack the druid and is forced
to retreat until the next battle phase. If others block
their escape, the target may attack them in an attempt
to flee, unless they succeed on a Fortitude →
Willpower save. This effect lasts for one round unless
otherwise specified.

Elemental Overwhelm (Challenge d10+1):
Overwhelms                              the target’s senses with elemental
energy, inducing confusion or fear. These intangible
attacks bypass physical defenses, affecting the
target’s mental and emotional state directly.

Competence → Perception checks automatically fail
with                                a potential -5 penalty to compensate, and
attacks suffer a -4 penalty to potential harm. Effects
typically last one round unless otherwise specified,
and specialized magical defenses or heightened
perception may be required to resist or counter this
effect

Area of Effect (AoE): A radius equal to
(2×Competence→Expertise                    MV)+Druidry bonuses feet.
Maximum Range: (Competence→Expertise MV)×4

feet.

Afflictions and Effects: Can apply area-affecting
afflictions                       like confusion, fear, or blindness.

Defense Spells

Nature Shield (d4 to d12 — Common — Protect)
Description: The druid invokes the protective embrace
of                                 nature, conjuring a shield to deflect incoming
threats. This shield can take several forms, each
embodying the resilience of the wilderness:

Bark Shield: Covers the target in a layer of thick bark,
absorbing blows.

Grove Shield: Surrounds the target with thorns and
vines, hindering attackers.

Stone Shield: Forms a wall of earth and rock, creating
a                             sturdy defense.

Flame Ward: (For fire-aligned druids) Encircles the
target with a ring of fire, deterring attackers.

Effect: Reduces incoming threat points by an amount
equal                              to the Challenge Die rank (e.g., d4 reduces by 1,
d6 by 2).

Spirit Point (SP) Cost: 1 SP per die rank (e.g., d4 costs 1
SP, d6 costs 2 SP).

Maintenance: Requires concentration, incurring a -1
penalty per die rank to other actions for each
additional round.

Interaction with Physical Shields: Combine threat
reductions                              from both shields, divide by 2, and round
up.

Nature Armor (d4 to d12 — Common — Protect)

Description:

Description: The druid calls upon nature's resilience
to                            envelop the target in protective energy, fortifying
them after active defenses are breached. This armor
manifests as different forms of natural defense:

Bark Armor: Covers the target in tough bark,
absorbing damage.

Stone Armor: Hardens the target's skin to the
toughness of rock.

Water Veil: Surrounds the target in water, reducing
impacts                               and fire damage.

Flame Shield: (For fire-aligned druids) Cloaks the
target                               in flames, deterring attackers and absorbing
damage.

Effect: Provides Damage Reduction (DR) equal to the
Challenge Die rank (e.g., roll d4 for DR if using d4).

Spirit Point (SP) Cost: 1 SP per die rank (e.g., d4 costs 1
SP, d6 costs 2 SP).

Maintenance: Requires concentration, incurring a -1
penalty per die rank to other actions for each
additional round.

Interaction with Physical Armor: Use the higher DR
between Nature Armor and physical armor. If Nature
Armor's DR is lower, add +1 per rank of the armor spell
to the physical DR.

If Physical Armor's DR Die is Higher: Use the physical
armor's                                 DR.

If Nature Armor's DR Die is Lower: Add +1 DR per die
rank of the armor spell to the physical armor's DR.

Nature Walls

Types of Walls:

Druids can create Nature Walls to provide area
protection and control the battlefield.

Flame Wall: Blocks attacks and deals minor fire
damage to those attempting to pass.

Wind Wall: Deflects projectiles and disperses gas-
based threats.

Shadow Veil: Creates an area of darkness, reducing
visibility                         and providing concealment to allies.

Challenge Die and SP Cost: Scales with Challenge Die
rank, similar to Nature Shield and Nature Armor.

Maintenance: Requires concentration, with a -1
penalty per die rank to other actions for each
additional round.

152


Customization: Druids can combine different types of
Nature Walls to create hybrid defenses, adapting to
specific threatss.

Common

Blossom/Wither Plants: d4—Common—Afflict
Description: [Inst / Area] The caster makes affected
plant                                 life bloom or die. This spell’s blooming or
withering effect is instant and permanent. The caster
can affect 10 lb of material per die rank. If cast at a
golem or elemental made of vegetation, it’s treated as
a zero challenge die restore/harm spell, the roll
equaling healing/threat points. Withering plants
using this spell has been known to draw unwanted
attention from druids, nature spirits, and the shee.

Branch to Staff: d4—Common—Modify.
Description: [M / Object] Transforms an ordinary tree
branch                                 into a tough staff. The staff created is not
permanent but perfectly balanced. It adds a
preternatural +1 bonus to potential harm while the
spell is maintained. The staff is wielded using the
Prowess → Melee branch.

Commune with Plants: d4—Common—Activate
Description: [M / Self] Grants the power to question
plants.                              The caster taps into the awareness of the plant
life and may ask specific questions, such as if any
sentient being has passed recently.

Small plants, like grasses and flowers, have low
intelligence                             and can only give vague answers. On the
other hand, ancient trees can be incredibly wise but
are often guarded in responses, even to those that call
plants friends.

Ears of the Bat: d4 (Variable)—Common—Modify
Description: [M / Creature] This spell boosts the sense
of                          hearing. Bonus points to Perception rolls involving

hearing are +1 per chosen challenge die rank: +1 at d4
up to +5 at d12.

Entangling Roots: d4—Common—Afflict
Description: [M / Area] Creates a tangle of roots that
ensnares and immobilizes all creatures within the
area                                  of effect, making them easier to attack.

Opponents must roll vs. Prowess → Agility or be
immobilized                                and unable to move for the next round.
Casting Modifiers: self or one creature is challenge die
d4; +1 added to challenge die per additional creature
or object affected.

Eyes of the Eagle: d4 (Variable)—Common—Modify
Description: [M / Creature] This spell boosts the sense
of                             sight. Bonus points to Perception rolls involving
sight are +1 per chosen challenge die rank: +1 at d4 up
to +5 at d12.

Nose of the Wolf: d4 (Variable)—Common—Modify
Description: [M / Creature] This spell boosts the sense
of                             smell (and taste). Bonus points to Perception rolls
involving scent or taste are +1 per chosen challenge
die rank: +1 at d4 up to +5 at d12

Plant Growth: d4—Common—Activate

Description: [M / Object] Increases the size of a target
plant,                               to obstruct, or just to impress. This spell
increases plant size by a cubic foot per die rank (e.g.
d6 Competence + d4 Expertise = 10 cubic feet). Ending
maintenance returns the plant to normal

Rose Whip: d4—Common—Modify

Description: [M / Object] This spell transforms an
ordinary                                rose into a whip-like weapon. The spell
requires a rose to transform, which returns to the
form of a rose after the spell ends. The caster uses the
Prowess → Melee branch to wield the whip. This spell
inflicts +1 threat point in addition to other bonuses.

153


GRIMOIRE


Summon Animal: d4 (Variable)—Common—
Activate

Description: [M / Creature] The druid summons a
normal animal, which is under his or her control and
can take basic commands. The size and type of the
animal determine challenge die. Example animals:
small (d4) rat, snake, canary, cat; medium (d6) dog,
wolf, eagle. The GM should use the rules for creature
summoning: see the chapter.

Uncommon

Animate Flora: d6—Uncommon—Afflict
Description: [M / Area] Once this spell is cast, plants
move                                      in accord with the caster’s will, but cannot be
uprooted. The area affected is the ability branch MV ×2
radius in feet.

Bramble Wall: d6—Uncommon—Activate, Restore
(1                              SP)

Description: [M / Area] This spell creates a wall of
thorny                              plants instantly from out of the earth. It uses
dormant plant life and can thus be cast virtually
anywhere there is earth. The wall extends to the
ability branch’s MV in feet for length and height, but
the druid can reshape its form. The wall is a foot thick
of prickly shrubs and tangled vines, with structural hit
points equal to the druid’s ability branch MV ×2.

Casting Modifiers: +1 to challenge die per extra foot
thick.                              Those trying to charge rather than cut through
the wall take d4 potential harm +1 per extra foot thick.

Control Animal: d6—Uncommon—Afflict
Description: [M / Creature]: This spell lets the caster
control                                  the actions of the target animal. The target
animal has a saving throw based on its size; d4 for
small, d6 for medium, d8 for large animals, and ±1 for
species or individual independence or docility. Wise
druids know that cats save each round

Gust: d6—Uncommon—Harm, Modify (1 SP)
Description: [Inst / Area] The caster summons a
forceful                                   gust of wind that sweeps through a
designated area, inflicting damage and knocking
targets prone. The spell deals ability branch threat
points against creatures and objects within its reach.
Area of Eflect: A swath emanating from the caster, 1 ft
wide and 5 ft long per caster level. Casting Modifiers:
The base challenge die is d6. Extend the reach of the
gust by an extra 5 ft for each +1 added to the challenge
die.

Healing Grove: d6—Uncommon— Restore, Protect
(1                               SP)

Description: [M / Area] The caster conjures a healing
aura                              within a natural grove or grotto, restoring health
and providing temporary protection to selected
creatures within the area. Healing: Restores a fixed
amount of health (to be determined by the caster's
ability roll or a set number). Protection: Boosts the
target's Damage Resistance (DR) by +1 for the next
round. Area of Eflect: A natural grove or grotto,
dimensions defined by the caster's level. Casting
Modifiers: The base challenge die is d6. The caster may

Description: [M / Area] This spell causes plants to
animate                                    and seize creatures, holding them fast. Vines,
branches, or the like grab at and hold targets in the
area of effect (radius of 2x Competence → Expertise
MV + Wizardry or Theurgy bonus). Creatures can
initially resist with a Prowess → Agility or Fortitude →
Strength → Ferocity or Might roll. Once caught, two
consecutive Fortitude → Strength → Ferocity or Might
rolls are necessary to break free. One can combine
strength with one’s companions to escape.

154


Shape Wood: d6—Uncommon—Modify
Description: [Inst or M / Object] With this spell, the
druid                                   can alter the form of wood, whether living tree
branches or roots (to make a path hazardous) or
wooden products, such as tables, staves, and the like.
One can shape or bend dead wood instantly and
permanently, but living wood springs back once
unmaintained. The spell can affect 10 lb of material
per die rank (10 lb at d4 to 50 lb at d12).

Shapeshift: d6—Uncommon—Modify
Description: [M / Self] Transforms the caster into a
different animal form, granting new abilities and
traits.                                The spell can transform the caster into any
creature of equal or lesser size, and provides a
temporary boost to his or her Agility (+2 to Agility
tests) for the spell’s duration. The caster must pay a

maintenance penalty of –2 to ability tests (other than
Agility) while maintaining the spell

Wild Growth: d6—Uncommon— Modify, Afflict (2
SP)

Description: [M / Area] Causes vegetation to grow
wildly,                              filling the area of effect with a thick tangle of
vines and foliage. The spell provides cover for the
caster and any allies within the area of effect, and also
grants a +1 bonus to Agility for anyone moving
through the area. At the same time, all enemies in the
area of effect are slowed (initiative reduced by by one
battle phase).

Esoteric

Plant Automaton: d8—Esoteric—Activate
Description: [M / Special] Creates a small creature of
vegetation to do the caster’s bidding. This spell
animates vegetation rather than summoning a
creature,                                 so there is no save against it. The plant
automaton is under the caster’s control and can

follow simple instructions or move about and attack
its                             own for d4 threat points. It has d6 hit points.

Plant Meld: d8—Esoteric—Modify

Description: [M / Self] The caster can meld with any
tree                                 or large plant if there is enough material in which
to hide. He then cannot be detected, except by magical
means. He can “see” out from within the plant but
cannot otherwise act.

Regrowth: d8—Esoteric—Restore

Description: [M / Object] Restores a destroyed or
damaged object to its former state. The spell can
repair any non-magical object, restoring it to its
original condition and granting it a temporary boost
to durability (+2 DR shielding) for the next hour.

Speak with Nature: d8—Esoteric—Activate
Description: [M / Self] Allows the caster to
communicate                                with plants, animals, and other natural
creatures. The spell allows the caster to understand
the language of nature and communicate with any
creatures that are normally unable to speak.

Tangle Trap: d8—Esoteric—Afflict

Description: [M / Area] Creates a web of thorny vines
that                      entangle

155


GRIMOIRE


and immobilize selected opponents within the area of
effect. The spell effectively stuns those affected (see
Afflict > Stun) so that they may not move or attack
until they roll (once per round) vs. Agility + Strength
to escape the tangle (a ‘twisted branch’ save,
obviously). Casting Modifiers: one creature is
challenge die d8; +1 added to challenge die per
additional creature affected

Thorny Shield: d8—Esoteric—Protect

Description: [M / Self or Creature] Creates a shield of
thorny vines that protects the target from harm. The
spell boosts the target's DR (+3 DR shielding) and
inflicts 3 threat points on attackers who strike the
target in melee combat.

Occult

Animal Transformation: d10—Occult—Modify
Description: [M / Self] The caster takes on the form of
a                             chosen animal. He can choose gender, and size from
small, medium, or large. He assumes the animal’s
height and weight and gains its natural abilities.

Equipment held or worn melds into the form,
reappearing                              when the effect ends. Character abilities
may be adjusted according to GM’s fiat, but passive
defense remains the same. The druid can know one
animal form (a general family such as ape, bear, bird,
fish, cat, lizard) per basic die rank (1 at Competence d4
to 5 at Competence d12)

Might of the Oak: d10—Occult—Modify
Description: [M / Self] The caster becomes as tough as
oak                                    and strong with it. The spell hardens flesh and
skin to the state of springy wood, reducing harm and
augmenting attacks. Add +3 threat points to physical
attacks, armor of d8, and damage reduction of 2. The

caster is impervious to cold and floats on water. In this

form, any passive defense damage is healed at a rate
of                               4 per round

Nature's Blessing: d10—Occult—Restore
Description: [M / Creature or Area] This spell taps into
the                                earth’s natural energy to restore vitality and
health to the target. It can heal a creature or selected
creatures within the area of effect. It grants a
temporary boost to health (+2 to passive defense) and
a bonus to the target’s next action (+2 to Prowess).

Casting Modifiers: self or one creature is challenge die
d10; +1 added to challenge die per additional creature
affected.

Plant Armor: d10—Occult—Protect

Description: [M / Self] The spell surrounds the caster
with                             bark and plant armor. It reduces harm to the
caster and improves his attacks. Add armor of d6 and

+1 to physical attack threat points. The caster also
blends in with plant surroundings: +1 to stealth
checks (or reduce opponent Perception by one die
rank in a search) if in an appropriate environment.

Plant Behemoth: d10—Occult—Activate
Description: [M / Special] This spell creates a large
plant                              creature to do the caster’s bidding. It animates
vegetation (about a medium tree’s worth) rather than
summoning a creature, so there is no save against it.
The plant behemoth is under the caster’s control and
can follow simple instructions or move about and
attack on its own. It is an exceptional creature: 3d4
threat points, hit points = threat point MV, d6 armor.

Legendary

Magical Transformation: d12—Legendary—Modify
Description: [M / Self] This spell allows the druid to
become                                a magical creature, such as a powerful demon
or a wise unicorn. The druid gains the creature’s

156


powers and abilities, including the ability to move as
the                            creature moves and control its magical abilities to
some extent. The spell also grants the druid immunity
to attacks based on the creature’s magical abilities.

After the first round, the druid must maintain
control                                over the chosen form, as detailed in the
section of Chapter 8, Rules Arbitration. The druid
must roll against the relevant ability branch, chosen
at the time of casting, with a penalty based on the size
and nature of the chosen creature (as described in the
Summoned Creature Modifiers).

Modifiers for summoning powers, such as hit points
and                           penalties for larger creatures, do not apply to this
spell since the druid is not summoning another
creature but transforming himself or

herself. However, the rules for
maintaining control over a
summoned creature after the
first round apply, as the druid
must maintain control over

the chosen form. Spirit points may be expended to
nullify penalties and keep the chosen form under
control

Plant Mastery: d12—Legendary—Modify, Harm
Description: [M / Area] This spell grants the druid
control                                  over all plant life within a 30-foot radius that
moves with the druid and designated allies. Allies
within the area benefit from a -5 shielding effect to
active defense. The druid can communicate with
plants, offering a +5 bonus to Perception checks
related to area knowledge. Enemies within the area
experience a movement penalty, dropping down one

battle phase and potentially suffering 1d12
threat points for every 5 feet moved.

Interactions with flammable materials
may                    result in a d4 threat point hazard.

Crafting Spells with
Defense Negation

Creating spells that bypass defenses, including armor,
requires mastery of advanced spellcraft, extensive
preparation, and often the use of specialized magical
components.

These spells are typically crafted ahead of time
rather                                than improvised in combat, especially for non-
mages. Mages possess the arcane finesse and
dweomers necessary for such intricate casting. The
following sections outline key considerations and
methods for crafting defense-negating spells across
various magical paths, adhering to the defense
negation mechanics of the Eldritch RPG.

Defense-Negating Effects

Spells that bypass defenses target physical and
magical                            protections through specific effects. Force
effects ignore physical barriers with raw energy,
ethereal attacks strike the target’s essence directly,
corrosive energies weaken physical defenses, and
psychic effects overwhelm mental fortitude. Non-
mages must craft these spells in advance, storing
them in scrolls, potions, or enchanted items for future
use. Defense negation requires Spirit Points (SP) and
challenge rolls based on the target’s defenses. To
bypass armor, the challenge die matches the armor’s
rank (e.g., d10 for plate mail, costing 10 SP). Shield
negation ranges from d8 to d12, with SP costs from 3
to 5 depending on the shield’s level (-1 to -3).

Bypassing Active Defense (AD) requires a d12
challenge                                die roll and 5 SP, leaving the target more
vulnerable. Spells can combine these effects, such as
negating both armor and AD, with the necessary rolls
and SP expenditures outlined in the spell’s
description.

158


Chapter 5:
Arcanum


t its basic level, possessing the
Arcanum                 advantage grants knowledge

of general magical components, rituals, and
techniques.                            Those with such knowledge (such as
adepts or mages) are called arcanists. With a
spellbook, proper instruction, and careful
planning, much is possible for them. Adepts are
the most advanced arcanists. Their Ritual Magic
feat grants the ability to create magic items,
curses (hexes of obje cts and places, vodoun),
potions (alchemy), and wards (sigil magic to
fend off evil). At this point, adepts start to
understand the higher principles of imbuing
materials with arcane energy, and can do so with
mastery.

Ritual Components

Components are exotic magical ingredients.
They                            could be physical substances or items
(special gemstones, mandrake root, dryad’s
tears, dragon’s scale, gorgon blood, eye of newt)
or more fanciful ones (a maiden’s sigh, scent of
thyme, moonlight, distilled dreams, the
strength of thunder). These sorts of details, as
with those involved in the preparation and the

rituals themselves inscribe the scroll using a
cockatrice quill; walk widdershins thrice

around the astrolabe in the noonday sun),
are                       left up to the GM.

While such details are mostly there for flavor, they
could give rise to adventures from the need to find
difficult to find components.

Arcane Rituals

All magic-wielders can enchant weapons and gear
temporarily, as well as perform rituals to create
hexes, wards, curses, and alchemical potions using
arcane formulas. Adepts, as Ritual Magic, craft
magical weapons, equipment, potions, and scrolls
with unique expertise. Their creations are potent and
long-lasting, a result of the Arcanum advantage and
their proficiency in artifice and alchemy.

When crafting, Adepts use their mastery die in
ability                             tests, enhancing item power. They specialize
in ritualizing spells for extended effects without
maintenance penalties, using focus objects. Adepts
gain a +2 casting roll bonus for every ten minutes of
unbroken ritual casting, up to +5.

Mages can temporarily enchant items using
Arcanum                                but lack the innate ability to add their
mastery die. If a mage acquires the Ritual Magic feat,
they approach adept-level crafting. The potency of
items crafted through artifice rituals is determined
by an opposed roll against the arcanist's Competency

→ Expertise + Wizardry or Theurgy, reflecting a
range of potency within each rarity category.

Arcanists require time and components to imbue
items                             with magical effects and, usually, skill in

handicraft or smithing (indicated by Precision or
Strength respectively), to aid the ability check.

Arcanists may employ expert casters and expert
crafters                            to help them in talents they lack, working
together to craft a magic item.

An arcanist working without assistance must have
basic                          knowledge of the kind of magic he imbues into
an item. For instance, no-one lacking some
proficiency in elementalism fire spells could enchant
a wand to cast fireballs. The arcanist may work with
other magic-wielders if he lacks knowledge of a
magical path, but if so, can only benefit to the lower
total of his own Expertise branch rank or that of the
assisting caster.

For instance, if they were working together to
create                                a holy object, an arcanist with Competence
d10 and a theurgist with Competence d6 would only
be able to produce an effect of 2d6+2 potency for
weal or woe.

To use the Permanency Ritual for crafting enduring
magic                            items and weaponry, arcanists (adepts) must
attain a mastery level—signified by a Competence →
Expertise ability branch Maximum Value of 20 or
more, situating them at a minimum of high-end
Level 1 or anywhere in Level 2. Mages, on the other
hand, require access to this proficiency at Level 3 or
beyond should they opt to acquire the corresponding
feat

Item imbuement time = One hour per level of
difficulty, plus an additional hour for every extra
effect included in the item.

Also, every additional incorporated, distinct effect
beyond the first in a multi-effect spell (e.g., Harm +

Protect) costs spirit points equal to the total MV of
the challenge dice beyond the first effect. Increase
zero challenge effects to a minimum of d4 for this
calculation and roll the ability check at the end of
imbuement time.

Harm effects depend on the caster’s own harm
potential,                          delivering up to the maximum dice of
Competence → Expertise + Wizardry or Theurgy as
indicated by the item description.

Magic Item Use

Energy Points

Every activatable magic item has energy points, that
score determined by the MV of the arcanist’s
Competence → Expertise → Wizardry or Theurgy
branch. For instance, if an arcanist had Competence
d10 → Expertise d10 → Wizardry +1, the item would
have 21 infused energy points (10 + 10 + 1 for focus).

Or for quicker determination — 8 energy points for
Common items, 12 for uncommon items, 16 for
Esoteric items, 20 for Occult items, and 30 for
Legendary items.

160


Magic Item Activation Cost

The owner of any magic item can activate it
repeatedly,                               with the basic activation energy point
cost as follows: 1 point for a single effect (including
bonuses to attack or ability tests), 2 points for area
effect, 3 points for a multi-effect single target, and 4
points for multi-effect multiple targets, with greater
costs possible. If a user chooses to activate more than
one effect at the same time, the energy costs are
cumulative.

Certain magic items are designed with the
capability                              for multiple effects, yet they can only be
activated one at a time, as per the item's unique
characteristics. For abilities that can be maintained
over time, the requisite energy points must be
expended in each round to sustain the effect.

Special Eflects

Defense Negation: Items that bypass defenses exert
additional energy drain due to their tactical power. If
an item bypasses a target's active defense, its
remaining energy points are halved. Bypassing a
target's armor costs an additional 2 energy points
per armor rank bypassed.

Afflictions: Afflictions have escalating costs based
on                          severity. The cost is 2 energy points per potency
rank of the Affliction (2, 4, 6, etc).

Note: If a non-permanent item's energy points reach
–1                               or lower, it becomes permanently inert.

Longevity and Reuse of Magic Items

Some items are “instant,” one-time items and are
instantly                              drained when used. Potions, and some one-
shot magic scrolls and wards, are of this kind.

Instant items never require energy points to activate.

Short-term effect duration, for powers not
maintained                               by the user, is equal to the item creator’s
Competence rank in a number of battle rounds (or
for random determination — 4 rounds for Common
items, 6 for uncommon items (one minute), 8 for

Esoteric items, 10 for Occult items, and 12 for
Legendary items (two minutes)).

If a “permanency” ritual has been cast upon an
item,                                it can be recharged again (see the Permanency
Ritual below). A user possessing the Arcanum
advantage or learned in the paths of magic used in
the item’s creation, may roll a Competence →
Expertise ability branch check to recharge the item,
starting at challenge die d2 to recharge 10%.

Recharge magic item: challenge die = 1 die rank per
20% of item’s charges restored (e.g., challenge die =
d10 at 80%).

Spirit Point Defense and Focus
Objects

Adept and mage practitioners can use iconic focus
objects                               to activate spirit points functioning as
another temporary defense pool, whether it be a
magic ring, staff, or another accouterment. Such an
object is a “prop” in this case or a focus for defensive
counter-spelling and need not be enchanted or
specifically attuned (See Magic Defense, page 23).

Casting Unlearned Spells

Scrolls are magical items that enable characters to
cast                                 a spell once. Using a scroll reduces Spirit Points
for characters regardless of their proficiency in
magic. Scrolls, along with grimoires and glyphs, are
used to cast spells. Magic experts can avoid the Spirit
Point cost by successfully rolling against the spell's
challenge rank or the scroll's difficulty level.

Grimoires and runes differ from scrolls in that they
are                            used for repeated access to spells, while scrolls
offer a one-time magical effect.

This distinction mirrors ancient magical practices
where                          using a spell would remove it from a book,
emphasizing the difference between temporary and
permanent magical knowledge.

161


ARCANUM


Casting a spell from a scroll depends on whether
the                            caster already knows the spell. Known spells do
not require Spirit Points, but unknown ones do.

Those not trained in magic, especially those without
the                              Gift of Magic advantage, find casting more
challenging. Failed attempts might accumulate
threat points, impacting the individual's passive
defense pool, illustrating the risks of using
unfamiliar magic.

Arcane and divine magic are distinct. Wizards, such
as                              mages and adepts, use arcane energy for
elemental control, while divine casters like priests
and druids use divine or spiritual power linked to
deities or nature. Though the sources differ, the spell
manifestations may be similar. The potency of magic
relies on the skill and creativity of the user rather
than the source itself. The challenge rating of a Feat
or magic effect determines the bonus or
modification, following a scale from d4 (±1) to d12
(±5), categorizing spells by potency from common to
legendary.

Permanency Ritual

Some permanent magic items such as weaponry or
armor                              always convey their benefits when used,
making them extremely valuable. Others have short-
term effects activated upon command.

Permanent items work like all others, save that
they                                do not become useless and inert if drained
below 0 energy points. Making magical things or
ritual spells permanent is possible using a ritual that
falls under the Competence → Expertise branch for
the ability check.

Adepts can use the permanency ritual on magic
objects                               with imbued static bonuses (i.e., +1 to threat
points, etc.), or on charged items (so that they can be
recharged even if they lose all energy points),
including magical traps, and wards.

A player who seeks to have his adept or mage who
has                           purchased this feat (an option available upon 3rd
level) make an item’s regular effect permanent must
consult the Permancy Ritual Difficulty table.

The difficulty for crafting permanent magical items
or                              traps depends on the power imbued: the highest
effective MV, MV range, or modifier.

So, a ritual spell to create a permanent magical trap
with                                  a Modify effect of 2d12 (a range of up to 24
points max value) requires an ability check rolled
against a challenge of 2d12.

The time required for a permanency ritual directly
corresponds to the preparation time of the magic
item or effect being made permanent. Specific
crafting times for various items before applying
magic are as follows:

•Sword: 1–3 days

•Ring: 5–10 hours

•Leather Armor: 3–7 days

•Mail Armor: 1–3 weeks

•Plate Armor: 1–3 months

For high-quality work, these times should be
doubled,                              and if the item includes decorative extras
like inlay and jewels, the time is doubled again. This
is in additon to the general rule of one hour per level
of difficulty plus extra time for additional effects.

Permanency Ritual Difficulty

Rarity      Potency     Difficulty
Common     d4 or +1     2d4
Uncommon    d6 or +2     2d6
Esoteric       d8 or +3     2d8
Occult        d10 or +4    2d10
Legendary    d12 or +5    2d12

162


Permanency Transference

An adept or mage can transfer the permanency
bound                                to an item to make a maintained and active
effect itself permanent, but it is costly, expending
half of the item’s original energy points. For
example, a caster activates his Wand of Petrifaction
(Afflict effect). It unbinds the permanency from it in
a crackling discharge of power that arcs to an
incapacitated giant, making its stony state
permanent (until dispelled). Only maintainable
magic effects can be used for this, and the transfer
can only be done once: the item becomes non-
permanent unless another permanency ritual is cast
on it.

Crafting magic items

Artificing Rituals

All crafting rituals include a challenge rating that is
used                                as an opposed roll against the arcanist's
Competency → Expertise branch + Wizardry or
Theurgy, rolling against the Crafting Challenge Table
(see page 160).

The rarity rating of an item created with an artifice
ritual                              is the highest rank of all the magical effects
imbued into it by the crafter, but there is a range of
potency within each rarity category. Occult and
legendary objects can combine a variety of effects
but only masters can create such items, generally
through a joint effort.

Common types of Ritual Magic imbuements are
listed                           below, each with one or more examples, with
further listings of magic items givien in Chapter 6:

Crafting Resonant Magic Items

Creating magic items is not merely a craft, but a
profound expression of alignment between the
arcane arts and the artisan's vision. This section
explores the nuances of crafting magic items that
resonate specifically with the wielder's abilities,
amplifying their innate powers and complementing
their combat styles and magical affinities.

Resonance in Craftsmanship

Resonance ensures that a magic item's effects align
with                               the user's specific abilities and traits. This
principle is key to crafting Resonant Magic Items,
which are designed to enhance the wielder's natural
talents and trained proficiencies. Each resonant item
attunes to a single ability branch within Competence,
Prowess, or Fortitude, enhancing the wielder's
natural talents and trained proficiencies. These
items are created by combining arcane knowledge
with a deep understanding of the intended

wielder's personal strengths and disciplines.
To                         craft a resonant magic item, artificers and
enchanters must consider the desired effects

and how they can best complement the user's

existing skills and strategies, in addition to the
usual rituals and materials..

Crafting a resonant magic item involves the
usual rituals and materials, but also keen
insight into the intended user's strengths.

Artificers and enchanters must consider the
desired                       effects and how they can best augment
the user's existing skills and strategies.

Ability Item Resonances

The following list provides examples for
understanding how to tailor items to specific
aspects of a character by outlining common
resonances between character abilities and
magic items, along with example ideas.:

of                           arcane spells.

Expertise → Theurgy: Amulet that enhances divine
healing                            spells.

Adroitness → Skulduggery: Cloak that grants
bonuses to stealth and deceit.

Adroitness → Cleverness: Ring that boosts problem-
solving                         under pressure.

Prowess

Melee → Threat: Sword that increases potential harm
in                            tactical combat.

Melee → Finesse: Dagger that grants bonus to
initiative.

Precision → Ranged Threat: Bow that improves
accuracy                            and damage at range.

Precision → Ranged Finesse: Crossbow that
enhances quick loading and aiming.

Fortitude

Strength → Ferocity: Armor that bolsters aggression
in                           combat.

Strength → Might: Gauntlets that increase strength
for                           heavy lifting.

Willpower → Courage: Shield that provides resistance
to                              fear effects.

Willpower → Resistance: Helmet that guards against
mind                          control spells.

Due to their focus on arcane skills rather than
fighting,                              adepts and arcanists rarely produce
resonant magic weapons that don't match their own
skillset or prowess with weaponry. However, affluent
nobles, legendary fighters, and ambitious
adventurers may employ an adept or arcanist to
build a weapon or item around their strengths. The
expensive materials, complex processes, and
professional understanding make these
commissioned masterpieces appealing.

Some magic items may possess multiple
resonances,                           but only if the item's nature logically

supports different functions. For example, a sword
resonating with Prowess → Melee → Threat for
attacks could also resonate with Competence →
Expertise → Wizardry if it can cast spells like a
Eldritch Bolt. However, items typically

only have one resonance unless their
core                 design allows switching
between different applications
backed by the item's inherent
properties.

Adepts come at a high price in such cases; priests
and                              nobles win wars with healing amulets and magic
swords. Social, political, and economic factors
impact the creation and availability of things crafted
for specific people and purposes. Kingdoms may
forbid such things for order. Some order them for
military, economic, or diplomatic reasons, but forbid
the commoner, depending on the nation.

Note that an expanded list of magic items can be
found in the equipment chapter (see page 180).

Activation Imbuement

Activation Imbuement (in the sense of causing an
event                               or a change through an item’s magic)
manifests as either a boon or a curse and covers
miscellaneous spells not fitting neatly into the other
categories.

For example, spell-activated boons include all
benefits                             like new temporary powers, divine favor,
useful non-combat spells, enhanced luck, and so on.

Curses are hexes, sometimes created with magical
sigils                            or glyphs incorporated into the item.

Examples of curses include Blight/Murrain and
Malediction, as explained in the section under
ritualized spellcasting at the end of this chapter.

Example: Ring of Sorcerous Detection

Description (Activate): This ring detects emanations
of                           sorcerous magic, whether of an item or the effects
of a spell maintained. When activated, the ring can
detect and identify magic emanations from the path

164


of Sorcery. Activates with the expenditure of 1 to 5
energy points, if that power level is available.

Components: One ring made of various precious
metals,                        skill to make jewelry.

Time to Make: Double time for the normal forging of
a                               ring × Wizardry bonus.

Effect: A common (d4) power level enables the
wearer                                 to identify a single magic spell affecting a
single creature for 1 energy point. An uncommon
power level (d6) detects magic emanations if present
somewhere near 2 energy points. An esoteric power
level (d8) detects the general direction of magic
emanations (can feel if strong and if near or far).

Occult power level rings (d10) grant the wearer the
ability to know the precise strength and location of
magic effects for 4 energy points. A legendary level
ring (d12) identifies a specific magic-wielder’s
signature (even if that caster is unknown) for 5
energy points.

Prerequisite: Arcanum advantage and the skill to
make jewelry.

Challenge: 2d4 to 2d12

Failure: Ring is flawed –1 per attempted bonus,
components wasted.

Affliction Imbuement

Afflict covers any of the following subeffects:
Confuse,                           Control Mind, Debilitate Sense, Distract,
Incapacitate, Knock Prone, Paralyze, Possess Spirit,
Slow, Stun, and Terrorize.

Items that cause afflictions still allow for a saving
throw.

Example: Wand of Agony

Description: Inflicts pain and paralysis on a failed
Valorous Saving Throw, lasting until the next
round's save or the effect ends.

Components: Wand parts, 1000 crowns of precious
metals                            × 13.

Time to Make: Twice the duration of normal weapon
smithing × bonus.

Effect: Paralysis immobilizes the target, disabling
defense                       points but allowing spellcasting without
somatic components.

Prerequisite: Arcanum advantage, wandmaking skill.

Challenge: 2d12.

Failure: Results in a flawed wand, 1 per bonus
attempt, components lost.

Harm Imbuement

Harm effects are magical attacks that deliver threat
points                             and sometimes increase the potential harm of
regular attacks. Other possible advantages include
bypassing armor or active defense points.

Example: Arcane Weapon (Melee)

Description: Increases a weapon's damage potential.
Components: Weapon parts, 1000 crowns of precious
metals × bonus.

Time to Make: Double the normal weapon smithing
time                             × bonus.

Effect: Adds +1 to weapon's potential harm per
bonus.

Prerequisite: Arcanum advantage, weaponmaking
skill.

Challenge: 2d4 to 2d12.

Failure: results in a flawed weapon, 1 per bonus
attempt, components lost.

Modification Imbuement

Modify effects either augment or curse abilities or
equipment.

Example: Gloves of Strength

Description: Enhances the wearer's strength.
Components: 4 gems (2 per glove) worth at least 300
crowns                            each, leather for gloves.

Effect: Increases Strength specialty by 1 die rank per
wearer's Prowess die rank. Only for lifting and
carrying.

Prerequisite: Arcanum advantage, leather crafting
skill.

165


ARCANUM


Challenge: 2d6.

Failure: results in nonenhancing gloves, components
lost.

Protection Imbuement

Protect effects include magic shielding, armor,
magical                             walls of protection, and various immunities.

Example: Brooch of Shielding

Description: Activates a glowing, semipermeable
energy                        field for protection.

Components: Brooch with precious stones,
minimum value of 1000 crowns.

Effect: Reduces potential harm, effective in surprise
attacks.                        Doesn't double stack with other shields.

Prerequisite: A brooch (jewelry held on with a clasp
or                              pin), round, square or in the shape of a quatrefoil,
inlaid with precious stones worth at least 1000
crowns. Arcanum advantage, jeweler knowledge.

Challenge: 2d4 = 1 threat reduction, up to 2d12 = 5
threat reduction.

Failure: Item is flawed, offers no protection, and is
just a normal brooch.

Restoration Imbuement

Restore effects heal, eliminate fatigue, cure disease,
revitalize                                the soul, and even raise the dead.

Example: Stafl of Inspiritment

Description: The Staff of Inspiriting is crafted to
channel                             divine energy, often made by theurgists,
mystics, and adepts. While it requires a theurgist's
prayers or a deity's blessing, it's not limited to its
creator for use. The staff is capable of channeling a
surge of spiritual energy, useful for restoring spirit
points to the wielder or others deemed worthy by the
deity involved.

Components: The staff is typically made from
hickory,                             ash, or yew wood, carved with symbols of
the patron deity and coated with a lacquer of resin
and wax. Its creation costs 55 crowns, multiplied by
its power rank (ranging from 1 to 5).

Effect: The staff restores spirit points, ranging from
1d4                              to 1d12, based on its power level.

Prerequisite: The creator must have the Arcanum
advantage                            and the skill to intricately carve the staff.
The crafting process also demands the participation
of a theurgist for reciting ritualistic prayers in honor
of a deity associated with healing or protection. A
deity's sanction is necessary for the staff to be
permanently imbued with its power.

Challenge: Crafting the staff presents a challenge
ranging                           from 2d4 to 2d12, dependent on the desired
power level.

Failure: If the crafting process fails, the creator
suffers                           a loss of spirit points equivalent to the
attempted power level, ranging from 1d4 to 1d12.

Potions (Alchemy)

This is the specific skill of brewing drinkable potions
that                             could have myriad effects. Simple magical
effects require easy-to-obtain components, and
minimal time, half an hour at least. Complex effects
are possible, but components can be difficult to
obtain, and brewing times can be hours, days, or
more!

The consequence of potions always mirror magic
spells.                           Thus, the challenge die to create the potion is
equal to the challenge die for the desired effect.

166


Magic Potion Creation

Skilled arcanists can infuse ordinary liquids with
potent                           magical effects. Imbibing a crafted potion
allows the drinker to temporarily wield spells and
abilities.

Description: An arcanist infuses a potion with one or
more selected effects, each specifically designed to
impact the imbiber directly.

Components: Vary with magic type and effect.
Creating                           potion infusions usually involves a pint of
strong, distilled alcohol and whatever herbs and
other ingredients are listed.

Effect: The potion's effects directly influence the
imbiber, with the specific impact depending on the
chosen effects.

Time to Brew: Crafting a potion takes one hour per
effect included in the concoction.

Challenge: The challenge to finalize the potion
(rolled                              at the end of brew time) is based on the
highest die rank of all included effects, doubled, as
per the Crafting Challenge Table. For Adepts, the
difficulty is halved.

Magic Potion Duration: The duration for the
activated                             spell effects is either instantaneous (such
as with Restore effects) or equals the creator's
Competence rank MV in battle rounds. For a more
randomized determination, durations can be:

Common: 4 rounds

Uncommon: 6 rounds

Esoteric: 8 rounds

Occult: 10 rounds

Legendary: 12 rounds

Brewing Failure: The potion is ruined, magic inert,
and                          components wasted. If any individual spell effect
has a challenge rank above d4, the alchemist suffers
a backlash of psychic harm. They lose 1 spirit point
for every die rank of each failed effect. For example,
if a potion were to grant its imbiber greater speed at

+1 (d4 challenge rank) and +2 harm to every strike

(d6 challenge rank), failure to successfully imbue the
brew would result in -3 spirit points as psychic harm.

Example: Potion of Celerity

Description: This potion quickens the movement and
speed of the beneficiary, enabling incredible distance
covered while sprinting or running. Grants +1 to +5
to Speed Focus.

Brew Challenge: 2D6 (uncommon)

Effect Duration: 6 rounds.

Components: Jackrabbit extract & ginseng

Potion of Healing

Description: Heals minor injuries and refreshes
imbiber;                             1d10 restored to passive defense and 20% to
active defense.

Brew Challenge: 2D6 (uncommon).

Effect Duration: Instantaneous healing.
Components: The morning dew, woundwort,
incense.

Potion of Might and Ferocity

Description: Grants +1 to +5 to Might and/or Ferocity
Focus                             (as decided by the imbiber).

Brew Challenge: 2d4 up to 2d12 (common to
legendary).

Effect Duration: 4 to 12 rounds, depending on brew
challenge rank.

Components: Ox blood, wolverine extract, and holy
thistle.

Potion of Mystic Vision

Description: The imbiber gains some hint about
impending                            danger or risks associated with current
plans or intended actions. Like the mystic Sixth
Sense spell (q.v.), the premonition comes in symbolic
imagery, or sometimes interpretable visions, at the
GM’s discretion. The premonition cannot extend
beyond the possible consequence of the action, plan,
or intention imagined.

Brew Challenge: 2d8

Effect Duration: 8 rounds (esoteric).

Components: Feathers of an owl, lady’s lantle herb.

167


Potion of Observation

Description: Increases Alertness and Perspicacity
focuses                          to a maximum of +5.

Brew Challenge: 2d4 up to 2d12 (common to
legendary).

Effect Duration: 4 to 12 rounds, depending on brew
challenge rank.

ARCANUM

Spellbooks and Scrolls

Adepts and mages have the capability to create
activatable                             spell scrolls or magical tomes like
grimoiries. These items allow individuals, even those
without a magical background or the Gift of Magic
advantage, to activate spells. To trigger the
predetermined magical effect, the user reads aloud


Components: A blend of gotu kola, mint, and a sliver
of                         nightshade.

Potion of Speed

Description: Increases speed during combat; +1
battle                             phase for every die rank increase in difficulty.
Brew Challenge: 2d4 up to d12 (common to

legendary).

Effect Duration: 4 to 12 rounds, depending on brew
challenge rank.

Components: Hairs from a hare’s scut, vervain,
rosemary, and snake venom extract.

Potion of Deathdealing

Description: Whenever the imbiber rolls for
potential                              harm, add +4 threat harm against the
target's active or passive defense, and the effect
bypasses all armor and shields. However, this
formula is taxing and inflicts -1 spirit point for every
physical attack made until the end of the effect’s
duration.

Brew Challenge: 2d10.

Effect Duration: 10 rounds.

Components: Henbane, aconite.

from the scroll or tome, or traces occult diagrams,
such                                as glyphs, sigils, hexagrams, and pentagrams,
using their fingers or an object specifically keyed to
the task. This process simplifies the casting of spells,
making it accessible to a broader range of users.

However, the use of such magical items by non-
magic                            wielders is not without risks. If the user
exceeds their available spirit points while attempting
to activate the spell, it can lead to a reduction in their
passive defense pool. Also, there is always a risk of a
potentially destructive magical backlash, which can
have severe consequences.

Unskilled Activation of Spells by means
of                       Scroll and Grimoires

Non-magic wielders attempting to cast spells from
scrolls                                or grimoires face considerable risks. They
must expend spirit points for casting; if the cost
exceeds their available points, their passive defense
pool is reduced. Ritual spells, which can be cast
without formal magic training, are even more
dangerous. A failed ritual spell triggers a backlash,
doubling the usual spirit point reduction associated
with casting unlearned spells.

168


Glyphs & Sigils

A magic glyph is any distinct symbol drawn,
inscribed,                            or carved into a surface that is used to
activate a single magical effect. They form more
complex spell formulas when used in conjunction
with other glyphs.

They are found written within spellbooks, tomes of
instructions for artificers, and ancient grimoires for
the most mysterious and dangerous incantations. A
rune is a small subset of glyphs commonly used by
adepts and mages of a particular path. A sigil is any
distinct sign that conveys meaning, such as the
unique identification of a magic-wielder, but does
not always correspond to a letter or part of a word as
a rune or glyph does.

Glyphs, Wards, and Scrolls

Characters without a magic-wielding background or
the                                Gift of Magic Advantage can attempt to cast
spells found in written form, such as scrolls or
grimoires, but they must spend spirit points and risk
a potentially destructive backlash. If they exceed
their available spirit points, it can also reduce their
passive defense pool. Spells in the form of rituals can
be cast without formal learning, but they carry a
greater risk of self-harm.

Adepts and mages can create activatable spell
scrolls                                or tomes, which allow the activation of spells
from their pages. To activate the predetermined
magic effect, the magic-wielder simply reads aloud
or traces occult diagrams, such as glyphs, sigils,
hexagrams, and pentagrams, using their fingers or
an object key to the task.

Wards & Runes

Wards are written spells that serve a specific
function,                             used to protect, summon, or trap. Wards
are generally sigils written directly on an object,
room, or, less commonly, a being. Simple wards are
written, carved, or tattooed (for permanency).

Creating a +1 ward vs. demons in a room would
require                           nothing more than a way to draw the sigil.
Complex wards can require components. For
example, creating a ward to summon and trap a
demon might require a circle of sulfur, with yew
fronds at the 4 points of the compass and a powder
of human bone in the center.

Ward inscribe time: Challenge die in seconds (for
chalk).

Thus a d6 sigil to protect against goblins would
require                             three battle phases to draw, assuming the
needed materials (explained in the ward
description). Wards are often imbued with
contingency effects (see Contingency Spells). Other
times they are in an “always-on” state, radiating
magical amity or antipathy effects (e.g., using status
or modification effects).

Challenge: Challenge to activate ward (rolled at the
end                                of drawing time) is based on the highest die rank
of all included effects, doubled, as per the Crafting
Challenge Table.

Wards can be broken by a Dispel Effect spell,
opposing                               the target ward’s challenge die. (If cast as a
ritual, Dispel Effect always has a challenge die equal
to the force being dispelled, takes an amount of time
equal to the original ritual to complete, and can
dismiss any magical status effect.)

Dispelling the magic of any actively maintained
spell                            requires one battle phase in a round, but failing
the attempt imposes a penalty matching the targeted
effect’s challenge die on the Spell Failure Table.

Ward of Minor Protection

Description: Grants the owner or renter of a domicile
magical                            protection within its walls.

Components: A method to draw the word.

Target: One room.

Effect: +1 damage reduction off the top of any harm
that                            might befall the beneficiary; also adds +1 to any
defense rolls vs. magical opposed rolls.

169


ARCANUM


Challenge: 2d8.

Failure: The ward offers no protection.

Demon Trap

Description: A circle through which a demon can
enter but not leave.

Components: Simply a way to draw the ward circle.

Target: One area, generally 4 feet in diameter.
Effect: Demons cannot exit the trap until the circle is
broken,                               and the trapped demon is forbidden to break

the circle without a saving throw versus the trap’s

challenge die. A successful saving throw allows the
demon to break the circle in the next round, or 10
seconds.

Challenge: 2d6 to 2d12+ (the challenge die to set the
trap equals the challenge die for a demon to break
free).

Failure: Ward offers no protection. You don’t want to
find that out too late!

Attunement Sigil (adept class only]
Description: An inscribed or painted symbol that
attunes                              the object to the caster.

Components: Simply a way to draw, engrave, or burn
in                               the sigil (the ‘Conjurer’s Seal’).

Target: One object or creature (such as a dagger or a
steed).

Effect: Attuned objects may be called to a conjurer’s
hand                           with a common teleportation spell.

Challenge: 1d4 (or zero if not in combat, given
enough time).

Failure: The sigil may be correct, but the attunement
fizzled..

Explosive Book Ward

Example: Explosive Book Ward

Description: A magical rune on the book’s cover
causes                             a 5' radius fireball to detonate any time the
book is opened unless the correct password is
spoken.

Components: Ink incorporating powdered dragon
scale                           for the rune.

Target: One book.

Effect: A 5' radius fireball explodes if the book is
opened, doing 12+d6 potential harm.

Challenge: 12+d6.

Failure: The book ward either fizzles or destroys the
book in the explosion (unless it is protected against
fire).

Spell Ritualization

Adepts and mages can perform rituals to cast non-
instantaneous spells without maintenance penalties,
but they need a focus object that must remain intact
during the intended duration. Focus objects must
include magical components suited to the intended
use. Ritual time equals the desired duration, so a

one-hour ritual summons a demon for one hour.
Adepts                             gain a +2 bonus to their casting roll for every
unbroken ten minutes spent in ritual casting, with a
maximum bonus of +5.

Ritualized spells use the same rules as normal
spells,                              but instantaneous spells cannot be ritualized.

Breaking the focus object: a Competence → Expertise
branch                             roll opposing the spell’s challenge die, or a
failed Fortitude → Willpower save by the caster
during a renewal ritual can break the active spell. If
the caster fails the Willpower save, all maintained
magical powers fizzle, including the ritual. Other
ritual spells within duration remain unaffected as
long as their focus objects are safe.

170


Hexes and Curses

Curse Ritual

Curse rituals involve the creation of a focus object
central                               to casting curses designed to prolong their
duration while avoiding maintenance penalties for
the caster. These spells require specific components
to target the victim, and knowledge in this area
includes understanding how to break curses. The
curse creation time is equivalent to the challenge die
in minutes. For instance, a d6 curse designed to
attract the undead would take six minutes to cast,
provided the necessary materials are on hand.

The challenge to finalize a focus object, such as a
mystical totem, cursed scroll or amulet, hexed
crystal, or stone, is determined by the highest
challenge die of all its

effects.

Examples:

Blight/Murrain
Description: Causes disease
in            cultivated plants or farm
animals. Components for
the curse might include a
hex bag with —
uncommon— herbs,
mummy dust, etc., to be
buried in the field or among
the herd.

Effect: Leads to withering or
sickening and can be fatal to
the extent desired.

Challenge: d2 per 10% of the
crop or herd to be affected
(e.g., a d10 for 50%).

Failure: If the soil rejects
the            hex bag, there is no

effect. If discovered and taken to a knowledgeable
adept                           or mage, the caster might be identified or
become subjected to their own hex.

Malediction

Description: Curses whoever touches the maledicted
totem,                         making it impossible to dispose of.

Components: Any object, often a trinket or minor
treasure, and ethereal glue.

Target: The first intelligent, living creature to touch
the                           object. The handler suffers a penalty to ability
tests, and the item persistently reappears.

Challenge: d6 per –1 to the victim's ability tests.
Failure: If the object is not cursed, the arcanist must
pass                              an ability check against the original challenge

die to be certain.

This advantage grants characters a unique magical
item                              or weapon imbued with inherent magic, either
inherited or discovered during a pivotal moment.

This advantage costs 4 character points during
character                       creation. The item's inherent magic can
only be dispelled by legendary means.

Initial Character Creation

Choosing an Item: Select an item or weapon
resonating                               with one of the character's abilities. This
choice could be a family heirloom or a unique
creation commissioned by a wealthy patron. Players
are encouraged to develop a visual and narrative
description for their Iconic Arcane Inheritance items,
emphasizing their unique history and significance.

Iconic Magic Items Energy Points: Players may
choose                                 a Unified Iconic Item, an artifact combining a
weapon and an Inspirational Focus. These items are
considered rare and possess a pool of energy points
equal to the primary resonant ability branch, a pool
which increases along with each MV tier of that
branch; average 4 ep, respectable 6 ep, skilled 12 ep,
great 18 ep, and phenomenal 24 ep.

Magic Properties: All Iconic Items start with one
magic                            property. Unified Iconic Items start with two
magic properties: one weapon-related function and
one Inspirational Focus function. Each function has a
resonance with an ability branch that determines the
item’s energy points, increasing with branch rank
rather than character level

Examples of Magic Properties:

Weapon Functions (Harm):

Enhanced Potential Harm:+1 to +5 to potential harm
rolls.

Elemental Infusion: +1 threat point of chosen
elemental damage per hit.

Special Attacks: Disarm, trip, or other unique effects.

Defensive Bonuses: +1 to Armor.

173

Inspirational Focus Functions (Activate, Modify, or
Protect):

Skill Bonuses: +1 to +5 to relevant Ability tests.

Enhanced Perception: Darkvision, tremorsense.

Mental Resistance: +1 to saving throws against fear
or                            other effects.

Minor Spellcasting: Light, Guidance, or similar
spells.

Resonance: All magic properties must resonate with
the                          character's ability branch (Competence, Prowess,
or Fortitude). Unified Iconic Items resonate with two
branches: one for the Weapon Function and one for
the Inspirational Focus function.

Example: A sword with Prowess → Melee could gain
an                           increased critical hit chance, while an item with
Competence → Expertise → Wizardry could reduce
spellcasting costs. (Note: This example is not
explicitly from the provided sources and may require
independent verification.)

Awaken Iconic Powers

Narrative milestones, determined by the game
master,                             can trigger the discovery of new magical
properties within the Iconic Item.

Unlocking New Powers: Characters spend Character
Points                            (CP) to awaken new powers. The CP cost for a
new property should vary based on its power and
rarity, using existing magic item creation guidelines
for reference.

Enhancing Existing Powers: Characters can also
spend                               CP to increase the potency of existing effects.
For example, an item granting a +1 bonus to a
specific skill could be enhanced to provide a +2
bonus. (Note: This example is not explicitly found in
the provided sources and may require independent
verification.)


ARCANUM


Item Activation and Spirit Points

Activation Mechanics: Iconic Arcane Inheritance
effect                             potency is capped by the character's level and
uses per day by their total mastery die uses per day.
The exact activation method for each power (free
action, bonus action, etc.) should be clearly defined
for each property. Spirit Points (Unified Iconic Items
Only): Activating magical abilities tied to specific
Magic Effects that involve rolling a die (as opposed
to static bonuses, which) can cost spirit points, with
the cost varying depending on the power and
complexity of the effect. First-level characters are
limited to rare items with a maximum of two magic
properties. Iconic Inspirational Items grant the
ability to replenish spirit points for their Unified
Iconic Item by spending energy points as described
in source for "Recharge".)

Item Loss

Retrieval: It could involve a quest or challenge, with
the                          difficulty scaling to the item's rarity and power.
Replacement: Allowing characters to find or create a

new Iconic Item, but at a significant cost (experience

points, rare materials, etc.).

Narrative Consequence: The loss could have story
implications, weakening the character or forcing
them to adapt.

Stage Properties

'All the world's a stage, and all the men and
women                       merely players' - William Shakespeare.

The stage of an RPG is as limitless as the
collective                           visual imagining of its players,
including its Game Master. In the analogy of a
play, the stage properties, or “props,” are items
carried, interacted with, or used by characters,
NPCs, or monsters within a game session’s
scenes. Props include weapons, armor, magic
items, and treasure. Special props have
designators that illustrate their special use, for
example, an iconic weapon or magic focus and
various damage types associated with each
weapon.

Weapons List

In Eldritch RPG, a character's abilities and
personal                          style take center stage, making a knife
as deadly as a sword. While medium and large
melee weapons have a minimum damage die
rank (d6 and d8 respectively), it's the
adventurer's unique skills and style that truly

set weapons apart.

Threat Point Bonuses

Focus areas like Threat or Ranged Threat boost
attacks                            by adding threat points. Threat is linked to
the Melee specialty under Prowess, while Ranged
Threat is tied to the Precision specialty.

Iconic Weapons are unique weapons with a damage
type                         (Crushing, Slashing, or Impaling) that gives
extra threat points if the character has the matching
focus: Might for Crushing, Ferocity for Slashing, or
Speed for Impaling.

Additionally, when expending a mastery die with
an                             Iconic Weapon, you gain +1 threat point per
character level and might trigger the “master twist”
effect (see page 179).

Weapon statistics are written as follows: Weapon
Name - Size / Reach - Damage Type.

For example, a warhammer would be listed as:
Warhammer - Large / Short - Crushing. Unarmed
attacks do not list weapon size but generally assume
Small for Medium-sized creatures.

Natural Attacks

For all player characters, “melee weapons” can
include                           punches, kicks, fangs, and strikes. These are
labeled as “natural attacks” in monster listings, but
the term “weapon” is used in the same way that
unarmed strikers refer to their knees, elbows, fists,
and feet.

Potential harm is calculated by adding the attack roll, any applicable Threat focus, and
bonuses                                                        from might, ferocity, or speed for 
Iconic Weapons. Expending a mastery die with an
Iconic Weapon adds +1 per level. For GM-controlled opponents, harm is based on Threat Dice
reflecting their type and abilities.

176


Basic Weapon Damage Types

When attacking with a weapon, characters can add
focus bonuses to their potential harm (Threat
Points) based on their specialization and the
weapon's damage type.

Specialist Bonus

Characters with specialization in Melee (for hand-
to-hand combat) or Precision (for ranged combat)
add their relevant focus bonus to potential harm:

Armor and Shields

Armor reduces threat points that exceed the
defender’s                           defense points by a die roll depending on
the armor type.

Shields reduce threat points by 1 to 3 points per
shield                             type above before active defense points are
reduced. The active DP must be above zero, or the
wielder is too tired to use the shield to block
effectively.


• Melee specialists add their Threat focus bonus

• Precision specialists add their Ranged Threat focus
bonus

Maximizing Combat Potential

All melee weapons, regardless of damage type
(crushing,                           slashing, or impaling), utilize the threat
(melee) focus bonus, enabling characters with higher
threat to inflict more damage through tactical

Armor Types

• Hide 1d4

• Leather 1d6

• Chain Mail 1d8

• Plate Mail 1d10

• Magic Armor 1d12

Shields

positioning and exploiting opponents’ weaknesses.
Similarly,                         ranged weapons leverage the ranged threat
(precision) focus bonus to enhance attacks with
bows, crossbows, or thrown weapons.

Iconic Weapons possess unique properties and
synergize                             with their damage types, enhancing both
melee and ranged combat. For example, an iconic
crushing melee weapon gains bonuses from both
threat (melee) and might, channeling raw strength
into powerful blows, while an iconic slingshot
benefits from ranged threat (precision) and might,
increasing damage and accuracy. Additionally, an
iconic impaling ranged weapon gains bonuses from
ranged threat (precision) and either speed or
skullduggery, improving precision and shot accuracy
for rogues. When a character expends a mastery die
while attacking with an Iconic Weapon, they receive
the iconic weapon bonus (+1 threat point per
character level) and may trigger the master twist
mechanic by rolling a 1, allowing a re-roll to
potentially transform a weak attack into a
devastating blow.

177

Magic and Natural Armor Types

Magic armor increases die-rank or grants a static
bonus                             (this bonus can be bypassed). Creatures with
natural armor (scales, tough hide) wearing
additional armor, or humanoids wearing multiple
armor roll types the highest die rank of armor types,
then add +1 per die rank for the secondary armor.

• Esoteric / Preternatural: + 1-2 damage reduction
added                            to armor roll. Other magic Effects could be
imbued (see Arcanum section).

• Legendary / Supernatural: + 3-4 damage reduction
added                             to armor roll. Other magic Effects could be
imbued (see Arcanum section).

Magic shield types add a static bonus (e.g., small +1
shield reduces threat points by 2).

Shields reduce threat points as part of a defender’s
overall                   efforts—deflection, parrying, or aiding
evasive maneuvers—while armor absorbs remaining
threat points with a random roll, reflecting both its
protective strength and the attacker’s chance to
exploit weaknesses, with excess affecting passive
defense.

Iconic Props

Iconic Props represent special items deeply
connected                                to a character. From weapons to spell foci
to cherished mementos, they empower various
actions. Every character may possess an Iconic item,
starting with one at Level One and optionally adding
another at every level of advancement. Such an item
can be a weapon, a spellcasting focus (designated as
a Magic Foci), or any item of significance
(sentimental, heirloom) that grants a bonus to some
ability or action.

These signature props not only add greater variety
and                             color to the character, but also provide a way for
players to showcase their character's individual
talents and skills. These items often enhance attack
power, spellcasting precision, or aid in ability tests.

Attacks with Iconic Props

When a character launches an attack using an Iconic
Weapon or Iconic Magical Foci object, they receive an
additional focus bonus to their potential harm roll.

This bonus corresponds to the designated damage
type                               of the weapon used or speccific magic item
properties. This extra focus bonus accumulates with
other bonuses and applies regardless of whether the
attack is close or ranged.

• Iconic Battle Spell Foci: Magic Harm includes any
harm                                 or injury inflicted by magic, such as fire, ice,
lightning, and psychic effects. When wielding an
Iconic Magical Battle Foci to channel harmful spells,
the wielder adds their vitality focus bonus to the
potential harm of the attack roll. Vitality represents
the life energy that enhances magical power when
used as a weapon.

Iconic Attack Potential Harm Calculation: Potential
harm                                is derived from a character’s ability branch and
focus areas, rather than strictly from weapon
properties. Iconic weapons or battle foci enhance
combat or spellcasting by adding a second focus area
bonus to threat points. For example, an iconic metal
sword’s harm adds ferocity (for slashing) in addition
to the standard threat (melee) bonus if specialized in
melee, while a magic user’s damaging spell
combines wizardry and vitality (for iconic magic
harm).

Example:

Matilda, a 1st-level warrior, strikes with her iconic
warhammer. Her melee skill adds threat (melee) +2,
and her strength adds might +4. Additionally, she
channels her energy with her iconic weapon bonus
(+1) (using a mstery die), resulting in a total
potential harm of +7 (Threat +2 + Might +4 + Iconic
Weapon Bonus +1).

Master Twist

If the mastery die rolls a 1, the Master Twist effect is
triggered. This allows the player to re-roll the
mastery die and add the new result to their total
threat points, potentially transforming a weak attack
into a devastating blow. The Master Twist reflects
the weapon’s enhanced properties, whether magical
or nonmagical, stemming from its significance to the
character.

Iconic Magic Foci

Mages, mystics, and theurgists use magical foci as
catalysts for channeling and condensing magical
currents. There are two types of Magic Foci; Battle
and Inspirational. Both kinds are usually wands,
staves or holy symbols attuned to the caster.

Battle Foci: When used as a weapon in close combat,
such                           items can increase the strength of Harm spells
by amplifying the intensity of damaging energy to a
critical level.

179


EQUIPMENT


Magic Style: A spell foci item; wands, holy symbols
channeling harm spells, or activated magic items.
Uses Competence → Expertise. For Mystics, this is
optionally Fortitude → Willpower. Attackers using
magical, Iconic Foci may swap Spellcraft or Theurgy
focuses for Speed or Reaction when determining
potential harm.

Inspirational Foci: Inspirational Foci are items with
sentimental or historical significance that enhance a
character's abilities in non-combative scenarios,
particularly in activating non-harmful spells or
ability tests. These items must be held or visible to be
effective. While wielding such an item, characters
gain a +1 bonus per level to skill checks involving
abilities from the designated Branch (Competence,
Prowess, or Fortitude), enhancing awareness or
focus. The branches and their corresponding
specialties are:

Competence → Adroitness, Expertise, or Perception.

Prowess → Agility, Melee, or Precision.

Fortitude → Endurance, Strength, or Willpower.

These Foci can be varied, such as jewelry, lucky
charms,                             or other items, but cannot be used for feats
or attack actions, only for non-harming spells
during battle. The mastery die is applicable to
specific Ability Branches during ability tests.

Swapping Iconic Items

Characters may change which item they designate as
their iconic weapon, spell focus, or inspiring object
(which can also be a spell focus) once per level, or
more often if allowed by the GM.

For example, a halfling rogue may designate their
lucky                             rabbit foot as their inspiring object for
Competence → Adroitness rolls, allowing them to
add their mastery die and potentially achieve a
critical success once per level per day.

Mastery Die and Twists

To summarize, the mastery die—scaling with a
character’s                           level—can be added to an attack or
ability test involving an iconic prop. It is usable once
per encounter or challenging situation, up to the
character’s daily limit per level. When the mastery
die rolls a 1, the Master Twist effect is activated,
allowing a second roll of the die.

The new result is added to threat points for
weapons                              and battle foci or boosts the success of
ability tests for other iconic props. Master Twist
represents a twist of fate brought about by the
character’s mastery, enabling them to fully harness
the power of their iconic props in critical moments.
This effect can only be activated once per use of the
mastery die, whether using the normal or an
alternate style branc.

Magic Items

The following magic items are detailed in order of
type                              and then rarity. The magic effect of each is also
listed, in addition to the general description.

Magic item effect duration: The short-term effect of
a                              magic item lasts as long as the creator's
competence rank in battle rounds, or the following
defaults are used—4 rounds for Common items, 6
rounds for Uncommon items (1 minute), 8 rounds for
Esoteric items, 10 rounds for Occult items, and 12
rounds for Legendary items (2 minutes).

Default energy points: The default number of energy
points                                for magic items is based on how rare they are

— 8 energy points for Common items, 12 energy
points                           for Uncommon items, 16 energy points for

Esoteric items, 20 energy points for Occult items,
and                           30 energy points for Legendary items.

Some items are specific, named ones created and
recognized by a particular fantasy species. In

contrast, others are more general, like
“preternatural weapon,” and serve as a

template for more variance in their types.

Artifacts

Items created with the permanence ritual or made
permanent through such means are considered
artifacts of two types: perpetual and bounded (See
Arcanum Chapter).

Perpetual artifacts’ magic effects are “always
on”                          and do not require activation.

Bounded artifacts require activation and will work
a                             number of times per day equal to the owner’s
character level. Artifacts are inherently uncommon
and are thus listed by potency rank rather than by
the usual rarity. E.g., Artifact 1 through Artifact 5.

Magic Item Listings

This section provides a comprehensive listing of
magical                             items for both players and GMs to reference.
Each entry details an item's Name, Purpose, Rarity,
Potency, Energy Points, Description, and Magic
Effect. Descriptions also clarify when an item's
magical resonance aligns with specific ability
branches.

Ability Branch Resonance: Aligns a magical item
with                                 a specific branch of ability, enhancing related

Magic Item Appraisal and Price

As described under equipment, we can assign
dollar                       amounts to items in the game world that
would be comparable to things in our world
(bread and ale as is, horse and cart or chariot
for a car, etc.). With magic items, that is

trickier. The base price for the item should be the
same                              as a sword (comparable to a rifle, say $500 to

$1000). Suggested price increase is a multiplier
based                              on highest die-rank of a magic item’s effect.
For example a Wand of Affliction with a d12
Incapacitation effect would cost ×5 in $.

Discoverable Magic

Casting Unlearnt Spells

In the realm of discoverable magic, learning new
spells can be achieved through various methods,
applicable to both divine and arcane spells. A
character may learn a new spell by discovering a
grimoire or spellbook, delving into the secrets it
holds.

Those with the Gift of Magic have the opportunity
to                             learn spells from companions, allies, or any
willing individual, provided they share the same
character class or meet other specific prerequisites
set forth by the Game Master.

This process of learning spells is distinct from
regular                       spellcasting, which assumes that the caster
has thoroughly learned the magical formula,
diligently written it in their spellbook, memorized
the ritual, and integrated it into their magical
repertoire.

Beyond these traditional methods, a character can
also                               cast a spell by directly reading it from a page,
uttering a word of power from a glyph, or through
other means of activation. While this approach offers
the flexibility of casting unlearnt spells, it is
inherently more challenging, spiritually taxing, and
carries a heightened risk, particularly for those
attempting to wield magic beyond their current
mastery. This risk is even more pronounced when
activating an unlearnt spell, as it demands a deeper,
more intuitive connection with the magical forces at
play, often leading to unpredictable outcomes.

Spirit Points Cost

Casting any unlearnt magic spell, whether from a
scroll,                          grimoire, glyph, or meticulously learned
imitation, costs spirit points equal to the MV of the
spell rank (Common spells; d4 costs 4 spirit points.
Uncommon spells; d6, costs 6 spirit points, and so
on). If the cost exceeds available spirit points, then
the residual cost reduces passive defense points

directly! Desperate magic-wielders have been
known to nearly destroy themselves trying to
launch one final spell to win the day.

Magic Defense &
Mastery

Cognitive saving throw: Competence →
Perception                          → Alertness/Perspicacity or
Competence → Expertise → Wizardry/Theurgy,

saving against mental manipulations.

Skillful saving throw: Prowess → Agility → Speed/
Reaction                             or Prowess → Melee → Threat/Finesse,
evading threats using agility and combat skills. The
Skillful saving throw complements the defensive
measures and harm system, defending against
afflictions when active defense hit points can't be
used.

Valorous saving throw: Fortitude → Endurance →
Resistance/Vitality or Fortitude → Willpower →
Resilience/Courage, resisting effects demanding


fortitude..

186


Magic Defense

Magic Defense is a powerful ability for Tier 2 magic-
wielders                                with the Gift of Magic advantage. It shields
against non-physical magical harm by utilizing their
active defense ht points pool. However, it does not
protect against magical effects requiring a saving
throw (see page 235). For more details on Tier 2 and
its benefits, refer to Gift of Magic in the advantage
section (page 23)

Mastery and Twists of Fate

The mastery die represents a character's exceptional
skills                             and grows in power as the character gains
levels. This special die can be added to various
checks, rolls, and damage, enhancing the character's
performance in their areas of expertise.

The size of the mastery die is determined by the
character's level, starting at a d4 for levels 1-4 and
increasing in size as the character progresses
through the tiers of play.

When using iconic items and weapons, or mastery
path                            spells, characters can benefit from the "master
twist" mechanic. In these cases, if the mastery die
roll results in the minimum value for that die size
(e.g., a 1 on a d4), the character can roll the die again
and add the new result to the total. This represents a
twist of fate brought about by the character's
mastery, allowing them to turn even the most

challenging situations to their advantage when
wielding these special items.

Characters can spend spirit points to gain extra
mastery die rolls, with the number of daily uses
increasing as they gain levels.

Note for the Game Master: Spears and Polearms
Engaging                               in a sword fight on a battlefield may sound
glorious, but it’s not so great when your opponent

throws a spear at you. In all cultures, spears were

more effective than swords in battle. This helped
keep                               foot soldiers safe when fighting hand-to-hand.
Fighters often use a thrusting motion rather than

swinging polearms, which are similar to spears. The

main differences are the tips of the weapons, which
can                           include a hammer, an axe, or a longer blade
(such as found on a voulge or a naginata).

Halberds are an exception to this rule, as they are
shorter                                in length and allow the warrior to swing the
deadly axe blade. However, most polearms were
placed on the ground with the hammer or axe section
ready to be used to unhorse or impale mounted
knights, particularly when the knights were at a
standstill.

Chapter 7:
Master of the
Game


If you are a seasoned Game Master, you
already know what to do. Put together

compelling adventures with a good mix of
exploration,                      interaction, combat, puzzles,
tricks, and traps; know the rules well enough
that players don’t need to; referee the game
fairly while taking on the roles of all men and
monsters other than the PCs and describing
scenes and results of actions as they occur in
response to players' statements. Players control
their characters; you control everything else and
collaborate in creating the story of their

exploits. Simple.

If you are a novice, do not worry; it gets easier
with                     experience. You can learn along with your
players. There is plenty of advice on Game
Mastering, but the essentials are simple.

Understand the game rules and apply them
impartially.                       Prepare for the adventure but be
ready to improvise because your players surely
will. Keep the game moving and the players
involved with brief, colorful descriptions and
interactions. Always let characters have choices
and fair chances to succeed and encourage and
reward good play.

Character Advancement

Eldritch RPG measures character experience using
character points awarded for the group and
individual achievement and story milestones. After
character creation is completed, character points
(CPs) reset to zero. Characters typically then earn
between 1 and 4 points per session. This is for
showing up (1 CP), participating (1 CP), and up to 2
bonus points for entertaining and intelligent play
during the session (see individual bonus points
below). The rules assume an average of four to ten
points per session, increased through exceptional
play.

Session Rewards

As a Game Master for the Eldritch Role Playing
Game,                              you can use the following rewards to
incentivize your players and encourage creative and
engaging gameplay.

Group Bonus Points

Surviving a devastating battle: Award 4 CPs to player
characters who survive the battle, even if they are
carried away unconscious. If they are later
resurrected by their friends, they retroactively earn
the group bonus.

189

189


MASTER OF THE GAME


Overcoming dangerous situations: Award 2 CPs to
each character involved in overcoming a precarious
situation.

Individual Bonus Points

Singular action award: Award 4 CPs to a character
who                          wins an encounter with a unique idea or
impulse.

Creative play award: Award 2 CPs for entertaining
role-playing,                             clever spell improvisations, or
engaging combat narratives.

Role assumption award: Award 2 CPs if a player
takes                              a risk in the game by being true to his or her
character’s concept, as long as it doesn’t harm the
group.

Repute and Negotiation Rewards

If your player characters hinder a threat or turn an
enemy into an ally, you can award them the
following character points based on the difficulty of
the potential threat:

•Minor: 2 CPs

•Standard: 4 CPs

•Exceptional: 6 CPs

•Legendary: 8-10 CPs

This reward is only granted if the characters
successfully                         negotiate with the enemy, significantly
affecting the story's outcome. It does not apply if the
enemy is defeated or assassinated without any
attempt at negotiation..

Keep in mind that a character's reputation can vary
between different societies and time periods in your
fantasy world, and may sometimes reflect infamy
rather than prestige.

Narrative Milestones

Completing a scene or story arc: Whenever your
adventurers                            reach the end of a major scene or story
arc, consider awarding additional points to recognize
their progress and accomplishments. Typically, this
is around 10 CPs for each participant.

Heroic Action

Once the GM rolls the challenge die or dice, the
player                              makes a test roll and the results are compared.
If the player’s roll is equal to or greater than the
GM’s roll, the character succeeds (in a contest of
skill, the defender wins a tie).

The difficulty levels of situational challenge and
their corresponding die or dice are shown in the
Ability Test Table.

Easy is the lowest rating a challenge may have. If
the                              GM determines the challenge is less taxing than
that, the character automatically succeeds in the
attempt. Likewise, no challenge is more difficult
than Formidable—the only way to describe a task
more daunting is to call it impossible.

Occasionally, owing to extraordinary
circumstances,                         aptitudes, and spells, the GM may
roll additional opposing dice (“with disadvantage”
on the table) or modify the roll by –5 to +5.

Hazards

Collision (falls, boulders, etc.)

Falling causes damage equal to 10 hit points for every
10                               feet fallen, with Fortitude the only Defense. For
objects falling onto a living creature, the GM should
assign 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 points of

damage for every 10 feet fallen,
depending on size and weight
(small, medium, large, huge,
gargantuan, respectively), see
also Chapter 4, Hazards of
Magic (Conjuration, Summon
Object).

Objects slamming into a living
creature,                modified by velocity
and circumstance; usually, the
damage will be similar. Do not
bother with complex formulas
for this. The GM may allow
active defense points to apply
against most of these types of
harm before depleting Fortitude.
f a hero is out of active DP, the
GM may allow a saving throw
instead. Roll Fortitude →
Willpower vs. the amount of
Potential Harm:the difference in
rolls is applied to Fortitude
(covering all physical or critical
damage to body, mind, and
spirit).

Weather (heat, cold, etc.)

Bad weather conditions can create situations causing
penalties                                 to ability tests while extreme weather can
directly damage creatures' active defense score. The
GM may assign random damage per round, as with
terrible heat or cold, or a flat number of damage
points for situations like lightning strikes or

hailstorms. The range is usually anywhere from 4 to
3d12 (1 point to 36 points).

Toxins and Diseases

Toxins and diseases (venom, poison, plague, pox,
etc.)                                are generally assigned a challenge die from Easy
d4 to Formidable d12. The GM also decides how they

take effect and what effect they have. Toxins
or                     diseases must penetrate the target’s
defense points if delivered by physical
attacks, such as a striking snake or
poisoned sword tip. However, if a disease

is introduced to the host, it only
takes hold if a Fortitude →
Willpower check against it is
failed.

Some poisons can be similarly
resisted,           though others are
more potent, with the
difference in rolls being

applied as damage to the passive
defense                     (or to a specific Ability,
depending on the nature of the

poison). This could occur all at once, per
period of exposure, etc. Other toxins or

diseases could, for example, apply a –1 per
die                        rank penalty to ability tests or cause the
equivalent of magical effects (e.g.,
immobilization).

Traps

Traps in Eldritch RPG are essential elements that add
challenge and unpredictability to the game. They are
designed to have damaging, debilitating, or
immobilizing effects, are typically sprung under
specific circumstances, and often catch their targets
unawares. Traps can be categorized based on type,
detection and disarming difficulty, effect, defenses
against them, their area of effect, and a general
description.

191


MASTER OF THE GAME


Table of Hazard Levels in
Eldritch RPG

Detection / Disarm Difficulty

Description Indicates the challenge involved in both
detecting and disarming traps. Note that challenge in
detecting a trap may not coorespond to the difficulty in
disarming the same trap.

Mechanics: Uses a two-dice system (e.g., 2d6, 2d8)
rather                             than a single die, providing a broader range of
difficulty and a higher average result. The first value
represents the detect challenge, and the second value
represents the disarm challenge.

Higher dice values (e.g., 2d10, 2d12) indicate more
complex or well-hidden traps, requiring greater skill
or perception to detect and disarm.

Effect: Measures the potential harm or impact of the
trap,                            including physical damage, magical effects, or
other detrimental outcomes. Expressed in threat
points, indicating the severity of the trap's effects.
This could be direct damage (e.g., 2d10 threat points)
or other effects like curses or debuffs. Higher threat

points reflect more dangerous traps that can inflict
severe                        damage or have potent effects.

Interacting with Traps

The outcome of a detect roll determines the
information                             gained about the trap. A basic success
might only reveal its presence, while a more
impressive success could disclose its function,
trigger mechanism, or both. Detection before
activation allows for potential disarming. The disarm
difficulty is assigned based on a challenge die,
usually ranging from 1d4 up to 2d12. Failing to
disarm a trap may trigger it, contingent on the trap's
nature and the severity of the failure, at the Game
Master's discretion.

Mechanical Traps

Mechanical traps are usually meant to cause harm
through                                 a physical attack, represented as threat
points, and so can be avoided by using defense
points. Depending on the trap and the situation, you
may be able to use both active and passive defenses.
They can have effects other than causing potential
harm, such as poison (see Hazards, above).

A character searching an area for mechanical traps
rolls                               a check using Competence → Perception →
Alertness against the trap’s detect challenge die (d4
through 2d12). A character attempting to disarm a
trap rolls against the trap’s disarm challenge die
using Competence → Adroitness → Skulduggery.

Magical Traps

Magical traps can cause almost any magical spell
effect,                               so potential defenses vary. The traps are
active until triggered or dispelled. Magical traps
follow the same rules as any other magic item; they
have internal energy points and become inert when
those points are spent unless recharged or made
permanent with a permanency ritual. Magical traps
are often invisible, but they leave signs that
magically trained characters can detect, such as a
mystic rune inscribed on a door, a slightly odd
lighting effect, or an itch affecting the skin.

A magic-using character can detect magical traps
using                         Competence → Perception + Wizardry or
Theurgy (using the twisted branch rule) against the
trap’s detect challenge die (d4 through 2d12). The
same ability branch can be used to roll against the
trap’s disarm challenge die to attempt to disarm it. A
character who is not magically trained who uses
Competence → Perception → Alertness to detect traps
may detect the existence of a magical trap on an
exceptional roll, but that’s all.

Creating Traps

Some traps are very old and it can be hard to figure
out                              where they came from. These include the ancient
sorceries that guard the cobwebbed tombs of mystic
warriors, the stonework in abandoned dwarven
deeps, and the simple but deadly traps of greedy,
primitive, and often violent humanoids.

Most traps are more contemporary, set in place by
NPCs or groups of intelligent creatures to protect
themselves or their treasure vaults, or to sequester

and prevent the return of their abducted prisoners,
and                             so on.

Player characters can also make traps. Mechanical
traps                               are constructed using whatever relevant ability
branches a character has available, assuming
sufficient resources and time. To create a magical
trap, an adept must create a trap ritual using ritual,
Competence, Expertise, and Wizardry (or Theurgy
for traps powered by divine magic). Magical traps are
constructed similarly to any other magic item but a
specific ritual can only create a specific trap.

Whether a PC can build a particular trap, and the
details thereof, are left to the GM’s discretion.

Trap Descriptions

All traps use the following format: Name, Type,
Detect/Disarm, Effect, Defenses, Area, Description.
The name simply identifies the trap.

Type: Traps can be either mechanical or magical.
Mechanical                         traps are made by and take effect
through mundane means. Magical traps are created
by and use arcane effects.

Detect/Disarm: Uncovering a trap is the first hurdle.
Each                             trap's detection difficulty is represented by a
challenge die, or sometimes multiple dice, ranging
from a humble d4 to a daunting 2d12. The more dice
rolled, and the higher their potential results, the
tougher it will be to spot the hidden danger. But
detection is only half the problem. Once you know a
trap is there, another challenge roll – with
potentially different dice for the challenge –
determines how tricky it is to disarm. So beware; just
because a trap was simple to find doesn't guarantee
it'll be easy to disable, and vice-versa!

Effect: This entry specifies the immediate or
prolonged                        consequences triggered by a trap. For
traps that inflict continuous harm, the duration of
the effect is linked to the trap's "Trap Level." The
effect persists for a number of rounds equal to the
Trap Level. For instance, a trap with a Trap Level of 1
will have its effect last for one round, while a trap

193


MASTER OF THE GAME


with a Trap Level of 3 will continue its effect for
three rounds.

Defenses: The nature of a trap’s effect may mean
that                              certain defenses (e.g., armor or active DP) afford
no protection against it, so those that are effective
are noted here.

Area: What is affected when the trap is triggered. It
can be a single creature, an area of effect, or
something else entirely.

Description: This describes the trap in general and
other                          important details, such as whether the trap can
be reset, if the reset is automatic or manual, if energy
points are used for magic, etc.

Trap Listing

Acidic Floor

Type: Mechanical

Detect / Disarm: 2d6 / 1d8
Effect: Acid damage; 2d8
threat points per round

Defenses: Active DP,
Armor

Area: Entire floor or
designated area
Description: The floor

appears normal but is

secretly coated with corrosive acid. When triggered,
the                               acid eats away at anything in contact, causing
2d8 threat points of damage per round. Characters
must rely on Active DP and armor to mitigate the
acid’s effects. The trap does not reset until the acid is
neutralized.

Bear Trap

Type: Mechanical

Detect / Disarm: 2d4 / 2d4
Effect: 3d10 threat points
Defenses: Armor, Active DP
Area: One creature

Description: Concealed under a pile of dead leaves or
other loose material is a set of iron jaws that snap
shut on the leg of a creature stepping into it. The
bear trap can be manually reset.

The Brick

Type: Mechanical

Detect / Disarm: 2d6 / 1d8
Effect: 2d10 threat points
Defenses: Active DP

Area: One creature

Description: Inset in a wall is a series of gems at
roughly                               the height of a human, dwarf, elf, gnome,
etc. The gems seem valuable and cannot be pried out.
If a lone brick that sticks halfway out of the bottom
of the wall is pushed, a stone dowel will launch from
the wall behind the prospective gem collector and

strike them with significant force. The “gems” that
then                             clatter to the floor will be found to be near
worthless. The trap does not reset.

Death Scroll

Type: Magical

Detect / Disarm: 1d4 / 2d10

Effect: Maintained threat points, 12+d6 (13–18)
per                        round

Defenses: Fortitude

Area: Creature reading scroll

Description: A dusty old scroll, rolled up with a
magic                              seal, placed just where some unsuspecting or
naive adventurer will inevitability pick it up and
regret it. The act of reading it triggers the effect.

Electric Room

Type: Magical

Detect / Disarm: 2d12 / 2d10

Effect: 3d10 electricity threat points

Defenses: Fortitude DP

Area: One creature

194


Description: A ritual was performed to electrify the
room’s walls, as well as any closed doors, and made
permanent (Energy points: 30 pool / 5 points per
triggering). The effect can be detected if the low
electric hum is heard. Otherwise, the field is
invisible. Anybody touching a vertical surface will be
shocked for 3d10 threat points. Metal walls increase
damage by ×1.5.

Enfeeblement Trap

Type: Magical

Detect / Disarm: 1d10 / 1d8 Effect: Modify
Defenses: Fortitude → Willpower → Resistance
Area: Archway

Description: Blue light fills the archway when
someone                             passes through it, and that person is
affected by a Modify effect that drains the Strength
specialty and all Melee attacks by -2 to every roll,
affecting ability tests and potential harm, and
preventing the “might” focus from being added to
the threat points. The trap automatically resets after
it is triggered. The effect lasts for 2 rounds.

Illusory Treasure Hoard

Type: Magical

Detect / Disarm: 2d8 / 2d8 (Illusion)

Effect: Illusion and Enfeeblement

Defenses: Fortitude → Willpower + Resistance saving
throw

Area: Room or chamber

Description: This trap lures adventurers with the
promise                               of a magnificent treasure hoard. Upon
entering the room, they are greeted with an
illusionary display of opulent riches. However, the
illusion is only the beginning. The trap triggers an
enchantment that affects those within the area. The
illusory treasures fade away, and the characters find
their physical strength draining away due to the
enchantment’s enfeebling effect. The trap can be
defended against by making a Willpower →
Resistance saving throw. If failed, the characters will

suffer the curse of enfeeblement, weakening their
Feats                               of Strength and combat abilities. The trap
automatically resets after being triggered.

Microburst (Arcane Ward)

Type: Magical

Detect / Disarm: 2d8 / 2d10

Effect: 2d10 threat points

Defenses: Fortitude (saving throw) then Fortitude
DP

Area: One creature.

Description: This permanent arcane ward can be
placed                               on almost anything: a book, a door, a chest, a
robe, a wand, etc. Anyone other than the caster who
touches the item is engulfed in a powerful sudden
reversal of gravity and then slammed back to the
ground by another reversal of gravity. The top of the
shaft is filled with spikes (for the 2d6 threat points).
The trap is constant.

Nightmares

Type: Magical

Detect/Disarm: 2d8 / 2d8

Effect: Inflicts 6+d6 (7–12) threat points per round
for                              d4 rounds, followed by a stun for d6 rounds.

Saving Throws: Cognitive (Competence → Expertise

→ Wizardry or Theurgy)

Area: A forest glade, a room, or an entire (haunted)
manor.

Description: The Nightmares trap assaults creatures
attempting                                 to rest in its area with terrifying dreams,
draining their mental and physical resilience. The
trap's effect lasts for d4 rounds, during which the
target must make Cognitive Saving Throws using
their Competence combined with Expertise in
Wizardry or Theurgy to resist the mental
manipulation. Failure to resist results in
accumulating threat points and subsequent
incapacitation. The default saving throw against this
mental affliction is the target's Fortitude versus

195


MASTER OF THE GAME


Willpower, with the GM having the discretion to
modify this based on the trap's specific effects.

Poison Needle Trap

Type: Mechanical

Detect/Disarm: 2d8 / 2d10

Effect: Administers a potent poison, inflicting 1d8
points of loss to passive defense per hour.

Defenses: Valorous Save: Uses a Fortitude →
Endurance                                 → Resistance or Vitality save to endure the
poison's effects. Armor: Protective gauntlets offer an
additional defense, potentially preventing the needle
from piercing the skin.

Area: Affects one creature.

Description: Concealed within a lock, this trap
houses                                  a poisoned needle that pricks the finger of
anyone attempting to pick the lock without adequate
hand protection. The insidious toxin weakens the
victim gradually, sapping their strength hour by
hour until it is neutralized or results in death. To
resist the full effects of the poison, a character must
rely on their physical resilience, using a Valorous
Save. Wearing sturdy gauntlets offers a physical
barrier against the needle's puncture. The duration
of the poison's effects is determined by its
concoction and can vary, leaving the discretion to the
Game Master to adjust the trap's lethality. Once
triggered, the trap is designed for single use only.

Poisonous Gas Cloud

Type: Mechanical

Detect / Disarm: 2d8 to 2d10 / 2d4 to 2d8

Effect: Poison; either 2d6 to 2d12 threat points, once,
or                               1d8 to 2d6 Fortitude loss per hour

Defenses: Active DP, exceeding threat points reduce
Fortitude DP

Area: 5-foot diameter cloud

Description: This trap can be placed virtually
anywhere:                           the mouth of a statue, the keyhole on a
treasure chest or a door, etc., or it could just be an
alchemical effort gone wrong. When triggered, a

small glass container breaks, and the gas escapes.
The                           potency of the gas is variable, and it can have a
one-time effect on any who contacted it or linger
until neutralized. The trap does not reset.

Rat Box

Type: Magical Trap

Detect/Disarm: Detect with a 2d6 roll, disarm with a
2d4 roll. Dispel Magic may also neutralize the trap.
Effect: Upon activation, the Rat Box imposes a +1

Battle Phase penalty on initiative for the next action

of all characters within a 5-foot radius. Additionally,
these                         affected characters sustain 1d4 Threat Points
of damage.

Defenses: A Cognitive + Expertise (Wizardry or
Theurgy) save may lessen or negate the initiative
penalty. Active Defense Points can mitigate the
damage.

Area: 5-foot radius around the box.

Description: The Rat Box is a small container
thrumming                             with arcane energy. When touched, it
unleashes a swarm of aggressive, illusory rats. This
spectral onslaught is a multifaceted threat, aimed at
disorienting and harming those who fall victim to its
deceptive nature.

The Reverse Pit

Type: Magical

Detect / Disarm: 2d8 / 2d12

Effect: 18+d6 (19–24) threat points, + 2d6 threat
points

Defenses: Fortitude → Willpower → Resistance

Area: One creature

Description: An overhead shaft of 20 feet in height is
masked by an illusionary 10-foot square section of
the ceiling. The unfortunate character is propelled
upward via a whirlwind, lifted rapidly into the air,
and then dashed to the ground when stepping under
the shaft.

196


Screaming Crystal

Type: Magical

Detect / Disarm: 1d4 / 3d12

Effect: Increasing threat points + status effect (see
below)

Defenses: Fortitude → Willpower → Resilience saving
throw.

Area: 5-foot radius

Description: Any creature moving within 5 feet of
this                               shiny glowing crystal shard will evoke
supernatural screams from the souls trapped within.
Every round, the basic effect gets more serious,
inflicting increasing damage; any creature whose
Willpower is brought to zero, suffers distraction in
round 1, stunning in round 2, and incapacitation in
round 3 [round one 2d6 + distract, round two 3d6 +
stun; round three 18+d6 (19–24) + incapacitate]. The
trap resets once every living thing within the area of
effect is unconscious.

Slanting Corridor

Type: Mechanical

Detect / Disarm: 2d8 / 2d6

Effect: 2d8 to 2d12 threat points, possibly + 2d8
threat points*

Defenses: Active DP

Area: Special

Description: A corridor of varying lengths leads to an
ornate metal door. The door is quite large and looks
very secure. When enough weight is gathered in front
of the door (generally three persons), a section of the
corridor suddenly slants downward, dumping all into
a shallow pit slightly larger than the door. The door,
which is merely a large metal weight, falls in on top
of them.

* If his Active DP reaches zero, a character is trapped
beneath                                the metal weight and may suffer further
damage. The trap does not reset.

Spear Trap

Type: Mechanical

Detect / Disarm: 1d8 / 1d8
Effect: 2d10 threat points
Defenses: Active DP
Area: 10-foot radius

Description: Activating this trap fires a spear that
can                              pierce an 1d4 number of enemies in a straight
line when activated; the initial target chosen at
random from those in its path. When the spear hits a
wall or reaches its maximum range of 200 feet, it
retracts.

Spiked Pit Trap

Type: Mechanical. This trap is a mechanically
engineered                         hazard designed to catch the unwary.
Detect / Disarm: Detection and disarmament of the

Spiked Pit Trap require rolls of 2d4 and 2d12,

respectively.

Effect: The trap inflicts 2d10 threat points due to the
fall,                             and an additional 2d6 threat points from the
spikes at the bottom of the pit.

Defenses: Characters can use their Active Defense
Points                          and Armor to mitigate some of the damage
from this trap.

Area: The trap covers a 10-foot square area and is
triggered when more than 150 pounds of weight is
placed upon it.

Description: The Spiked Pit Trap consists of a 10-
foot                                by 10-foot floor section rigged to collapse under
sufficient weight, dropping anything on it into a 20-
foot deep pit lined with cruelly rusted spikes. The fall
causes harm, and the rusty spikes beckon below.

Characters can avoid the fall, and thus the spikes, by
successfully using their Active Defense Points.

Escaping the pit requires a Fortitude > Strength roll
of                          moderate difficulty (2d4). Once triggered, this
trap cannot be reset.

197


MASTER OF THE GAME


Spin Trap

Type: Magical

Detect / Disarm: 2d6 / 2d6

Effect: Turns creatures around

Defenses: The advantage “Sense of Direction”
Area: Usually 5 to 10-foot square to trigger, but as
large as desired

Description: Stepping into this area triggers a magic
field                              that affects every sentient creature standing
within 10 feet of the area or another affected
creature, like a chain reaction. All creatures are
immediately faced in the opposite direction. This
creates no sensation other than confusion, but it can
be problematic if the Spin Trap takes effect in
darkness or a hall of mirrors. The advantage of a
“sense of direction” thwarts the trap outright for
those possessing it.

Tainted Trove

Type: Magical

Detect / Disarm: 2d8 / 2d8 (Illusion)

Effect: Poison 2d10 threat points per hour until
neutralized, ending one day after contact
Defenses: Armor, Shield, Active DP

Area: One or more creatures

Description: A vast and fantastic treasure trove is
discovered containing all manner of valuables as
devised by the GM. This is an intricate illusion
layered on top of base metal coins, rocks, junk
weapons, etc. Everything has been treated with a
slow-acting but very potent contact poison,
activated by body heat, that will eat away at
Fortitude, likely resulting in death. Unused poison
dissipates with the illusion a few minutes after
contact, and the trap does not reset.

Tripwire

Type: Mechanical

Detect / Disarm: 2d4 to 2d8 / 2d4 to 2d8
Effect: 2d4 to 2d10 threat points
Defenses: Active DP

Area: One creature

Description: A very thin, camouflaged, or hidden
tripwire                            springs the trap when broken. The exact
nature of the trap is variable and left to the
discretion of the GM. It could be darts, or a pendulum
blade, or a falling block, etc. The trap does not reset.

Wards, Sigils and Rune Traps

Symbol traps are a unique and potent category of
magical                             traps, meticulously crafted through rare and
often dangerous rituals. While some symbol 'traps'
may echo existing magic effects like Activate or
Afflict, following standard spell potency rules and
functioning as magical items, others mirror the
terrible power outlined in the Trap Level Table.

These potent traps, woven by the most skilled and
ruthless of magic-wielders, require an Adept
matching the trap's level and an expenditure of
Spirit Points proportional to the trap's power (4, 6,
8, 10, 12 at creation), without the need for further
maintenance.

Unlike simple wards, symbol traps manifest as
glyphs,                             runes, or sigils, their effects extending far
beyond mere warnings. They inflict enhanced harm,
mirroring the Trap Table for their potential damage,
and the ritual to bind them is correspondingly
complex and demanding. Once complete, the trap
lies in wait, triggered by the simple act of a footstep
or the whisper of a forgotten passphrase. While most
require rejuvenation over time as their energies fade
(especially those with long-term impacts), some
legendary traps may bear the mark of a permanency
spell.

All symbol traps are the product of ritual magic.
Adepts,                              with the aid of their Magic Rituals feat,
gather mundane and esoteric components,
painstakingly inscribing the chosen symbol onto a
surface or item. Only then does the work of weaving
raw magical energies into the symbol's form begin, a
process filled with incantations and careful
manipulation.

Magical Symbol Trap

Detect / Disarm: 2d8 / 2d10

Effect: Inflicts entropic damage, depleting Active DP
and bypassing armor. Deals a total of 2d6 Threat
Points, with half the damage first targeting Active
DP. Targets must also attempt a Valorous Save
(Fortitude + Strength) to resist being restrained and
suffering a -2 penalty to all physical ability tests.

Defenses: Valorous Save (Fortitude + Strength)
prevents                          restraint and penalties. Active DP mitigates
some damage if not fully depleted by the entropic
effect.

Area: 10-foot radius

Description: This subtle ward is inscribed on a
surface or object. When triggered, it summons
spectral chains that bind all within its radius,
hindering their movement and reducing their
physical prowess. The ward remains active until
dispelled or its duration ends.

Sigil of Searing Light

Type: Magical Symbol Trap Detect / Disarm: 1d8 /
2d8

Effect: Emits a burst of blinding light, causing 3d8
Threat                              Points and escalating disorientation. Targets
must make a Skillful Saving Throw (Reflexes +
Agility). On a failed save, they take an additional 1d6
Threat Points per round that they remain within the
area, and suffer a cumulative -1 penalty to Skillful
saves for each round exposed.

Defenses: Successful Skillful Save (Reflexes +
Agility)                             negates disorientation penalties and reduces
damage taken by half.

Area: 15-foot radius

Description: This sigil, often etched upon doorways
or                           treasure chests, unleashes a cone of intense light
when activated. Those caught unaware suffer
burning pain and escalating disorientation,
hindering their ability to react.

Chapter 8:
Encounters


ole-playing games are not exciting
without                 conflict. After all, these

games are about adventure, allowing us to step
out                           of our mundane existence, vicariously
clobbering wickedness in the fantasy, modern,
or science fiction realms.

Eldritch makes it easy to create opponents in the
game. GMs do not have to spend hours creating
statistics for them but can focus on speedy
action and excitement during play.

Social Encounters

Eldritch, like most RPGs, encourages those
Game                         Masters weaving stories in collaboration
with their players to consider more than just
combat. It is up to the Game Master to queue up
plenty of opportunities for players to engage in
social interaction while achieving fame,
exploring mythical lands, and defeating their
foes.

Most contests between a player character and a
non-player character are opposed, the total of a
difficulty check using Competence → Adroitness

→ Cleverness, or Skulduggery or Perception →

Perspicacity compared to an opposed roll by
the                    opponent, which could be Fortitude →
Willpower → Courage (to avoid

intimation), Competence → Perception →

Perspicacity (to detect deception), or other

combinations depending on circumstance and GM
fiat                               in collaboration with player ingenuity.

As with all contests between two living subjects in
the game, the higher result wins, with the defender
winning a tie.

It’s recommended that Game Masters roll the
opposing                             dice of the NPC’s opposing traits/skills in
secret, at least during key scenes of high stakes, so
that no player can automatically know whether one
attempt at persuasion, intimation or other types of
influence was successful beyond a doubt. This can
enhance tension. Likewise, the Game Masters may
secretly roll a difficulty check using one of the
character’s traits or skills, testing the character’s
passive insight or perceptual skills.

The GM may use either an NPC’s opposing ability
branch                            (simple contest) or a challenge die
determined by the relative difficulty as decided.

Some examples:

Is the NPC lying? Is the Guild Master of Thieves
NPC                             lying about where the treasure is? The GM asks
the players to each roll their Competence →
Perception → Perspicacity, but in this case, applied
to notice the nuances of body language or facial
expressions.

Will the NPC trust us? The party meets a guard at
the gate, one who by rumor despises his corrupt
captain. The player characters try to persuade this
guard to pass to infiltrate the quarters and subdue

201

his captain. Competence → Perception →

Perspicacity.

Can the NPC be persuaded? Advantages like
empathy                               may aid a character in persuading,
influencing one with guile, kindness, compassion, or
unnerving insight. Use Competence → Adroitness→
Cleverness or Skulduggery vs Competence →
Perception → Perspicacity.

Or perhaps one would employ the advantage of
intimation or brutishness, the GM calling for a
contest of Fortitude → Strength with Ferocity or
Might if possessed versus the target’s Fortitude →
Willpower → Resilience.

Is the NPC subdued or acquiescent? One who is
commanding may take charge and affect the morale
of those in their charge or cause fear in the ranks of
their enemies. An NPC losing a contest using
Fortitude → Willpower may be cowed, acquiescent to
any demand, or retreat altogether.

NPC Reactions

Some NPCs are weak-willed in concept or
unimportant                                in the grand scheme of the story. These
individuals are particularly subject to player
character persuasion, diplomacy, or intimation. For
minor NPCs, encounters need not be overly defined.

The GM may decide that any cowardly or too
changeable                      personality trait is the antithesis of any
particular NPC of importance.

Or, if more lenient, the game master may consider
any                         favorable reaction for a sharply defined NPC
concept as unlikely, even while allowing the dice to
have some influence over outcomes.

Social Saving Throws

Most creatures use their Saving Throw dice as as the
default opposing dice in social contests using either
traits or skills.

For important NPCs, the game master may assign
different                              Saving Throw dice for social aspects or add

more traits during the session prep (or on the fly) to
further modify the opposed rolls.

The game master has the ability to modify an NPC's
roles                             based on an impassioned speech or a social
mistake. Similarly, the GM can choose to modify a
creature's social capabilities if they are using a power
of magic, but this decision ultimately depends on the
specific NPC or monster in question.

For more information on NPCs and other encounter
types,                           please refer to the Game Mastering and
Opponents section of the book. Some traits that may
modify contest of skill or saving throws are listed
below.

Courageous: The NPC/Creature adds a bonus of +1 to

+4 to contests of ability that are meant to intimidate
or                            coerce the subject through fear or imposing
physical presence.

Devoted: The NPC/Creature adds +1 to +4 to contests
of                             ability meant to demoralize, corrupt, dishearten,
subvert, seduce, or otherwise violate one’s true spirit
and moral compass.

Perceptive: The NPC/Creature adds +1 to +4 to
contests                               of ability meant to trick, deceive, swindle it

Unswayable: The NPC/Creature adds +1 to +4 to
contests                              of ability meant to bring one to heel, to
compel to action, or coerce to abandon some course
under another’s repute, station, rank, or class.

Shrewd: The NPC/Creature adds +1 to +4 to contests
of                             ability meant to confuse the subject through
deception, fallacious arguments, or misleading with
acting or an air of intellectual pomposity.

Encounters in Detail

The Eldritch role-playing game is about the story,
and                                the rules are only brought up when needed or fit
with how the story is going. Few things kill the fun at
the table faster than a fight that turns into a
discussion of the rules or the rolling of dice that
stops the action from happening.

This section of the rules gives you all the information
you                             need to understand and create creatures and
NPCs in the game.

Quick Combat Encounters

Eldritch has five creature categories (described in
full                             below), but most random combat encounters can
be dealt with simply using three of them.

Decide if the opponents are minor (weak), standard
(average),                                 or exceptional (tough). They use one, two,
or three dice respectively for both hit points (using
MV) and potential harm.

Assign a die type for rank and file (d4 or d6), and
higher ones for stronger individuals or henchmen
(d6 or d8), and leader types (d8, d10, or d12) if
present.

Determine the numbers appearing and
circumstances                                of the encounter to suit the campaign.
For example, do you want to ambush the adventurers
with a dozen scrawny bandits? As minor foes they
have a single die. Most are d4 bandits with 4 hit
points doing d4 points of potential harm in attacks.

A d6 mage with them has 6 hit points and can
inflict                            d6 potential harm with her spells, their d8
leader has 8 hit points and does d8 points of
potential harm.

Standard foes (such as healthy bandits) would use
two                              dice for hit points and potential harm (2d4 etc.),
and so on. It’s that simple.

Creature Categories

There are five creature categories in Eldritch: minor,
standard, exceptional, and legendary. Minor,
standard, and exceptional creatures are usually
straightforward to handle in combat, utilizing Quick
Stat Blocks for simplicity, but legendary creatures
are a different matter. While they do not use a full-
fledged character sheet like PCs, they often possess
superior abilities, a wider breadth of knowledge, or
unusual powers that make them stand out from
other opponents.

However, this doesn't preclude other types of
creatures                              or characters, whether NPC or beast or
monster, from having intelligence, personality,
skills, or other abilities. Of course, there is no bar to
creating interesting personalities, quirks, and
strategies for lesser foes. The section on Monstrous
Tropes is at the end of this chapter and describes
how to create a range of impromptu monsters that
can help guide you in inventing new ones.

Minor Opponents

Minor opponents are the most common type and the
easiest to defeat in combat. This bottom end
category consists of abundant and inferior monsters,
usually encountered in numbers, but whose
individual inefficiency makes large-scale battles
against them swift.

Examples include rapacious hordes of goblins or
kobolds, ordinary rabble, inexperienced town
militias, and weaker undead minions like skeletons
and zombies.

Minor opponents uncommonly have more than one
attack type above d4 (see Threat Dice below) and are
usually medium-sized or smaller.

At the GM’s discretion, strong minor creatures (e.g.
goblin leaders) may have more than one single die
attack higher than d4, but no more than d12. They
rarely have much treasure.

ENCOUNTERS


Standard Opponents

Standard opponents are more of a threat but usually
no                            match for a single PC.

Typical standard creatures include town guards,
ordinary                       soldiers, common criminals, experienced
hirelings, and animals and monsters of all sorts.

These foes use up to two dice to attack (2d6 etc.) and
can inflict significant damage to a hero when
attacking in force, especially if they number eight or
more.

Exceptional Opponents

Exceptional creatures pose a serious threat, use up to
three dice to attack (3d8 etc.), have more hit points,
and are tougher to defeat.

Experienced warriors, assassins, dangerous
animals                          like bears or wolves, or any other major
opponent can be an exceptional foe.

Legendary Opponents

Legendary opponents in the game can be either NPCs
or                           creatures that are nearly as fully developed or at
least as relevant to the narrative as the player
characters (PCs). They are typically exceptional in
overall ability, and include monsters like gorgons,
chimeras, lesser dragons, golems, and werewolves,
which pose a great threat.

What sets legendary opponents apart from other
categories of opponents is that the title of
"legendary" can be associated with any creature,
from minor to legendary in terms of combat
strength.

Legendary opponents may have exceptional-level
Threat                           Dice and abilities, and their die ranks can
exceed d12 or 3d12, unlike any other category of
opponent. Legendary monsters and iconic NPCs are
the only opponents in the game that can possess
ranks of d14, d16, d18, and d20, up to 3d20.

Some monsters can also attack with innate arcane
aptitudes,                               such as the fiery breath of a dragon or the
supernatural, paralyzing scream of a banshee. In
some cases, spells and powers, such as mind control
or stunning effects, use Opposed Rolls rather than
straight damage.

Uncommon die ranks

Player adventurers typically use standard dice (d4 to
d12). Powerful NPCs and monsters may use unusual
dice (d3, d5, d7, d16, d24), available as “Zocchi dice”
online. Standard dice can simulate these: d3 (d6 ÷ 2),
d5 (d10 ÷ 2), d7 (d8, re-roll 8), or d16 (d20, ignore
17+).

Creating Creature Stats

Regardless of whether they are friend or foe, all
creatures and NPCs in the game adhere to the
following statistical template.

Type (TY): minor (weak), average (typical), or
exceptional (difficult).

Threat Dice (TD): Assign one, two, or three dice,
respectively,                            for potential harm in each category of
Melee (weapons), Natural (unarmed attacks or claws
and teeth), Ranged (missile weapons or natural
ranged attacks), and Arcane (innate magic or
prepared spells that harm) potential harm.

Extra Attacks (EA): list any extra attacks within the
round, representing most anything; breath
weapons, extra limbs, mind powers, or incredible
speed.

Hit Points (HP): Hit points for creatures are
calculated                               based on their threat level and attack
forms. All creatures, including minor, standard,
exceptional, and legendary creatures, have hit points
equal to the maximum value of their highest threat
category. The final hit points score is further
modified by the creature’s size and nature. The size
of a creature can range from minuscule to
gargantuan, with each size category having a
corresponding modifier. The nature of a creature can
be mundane, magical, preternatural, or
supernatural, with each nature category also having
a corresponding modifier.

Damage Reduction (PR): This score adds bonus hit
points                               to the creature’s overall HP score if less than
Legendary in status. The bonus represents armor and
shielding (see Creature Armor and Shields Bonus HP
in this chapter). If Legendary, then damage
reduction is normally listed as a damage reduction
die rank.

Saving Throw (ST): All creatures have a saving throw
that                            allows them to resist physical or mental
afflictions, whether spells, hazards, or other

misfortunes, including sometimes social or mental
contests.

Battle Phase (BP): Represents the creature’s basic
prowess, determining its initiative phase within a
battle round before modifiers.

Notes: All special notes concerning this creature,
including                           specific weapons, armor, and treasure
(sometimes abbreviated WAT), are listed here.

Attack Forms

As described above, most creatures do not have
detailed                           ability branches, and their attack forms are
simply grouped under Melee, Natural, Ranged, and
Arcane.

If there is a need to specify potential harm further,
for                           instance if a player character has magic armor
with a bonus against cutting attacks, this is easy to
decide on the spot. A giant uses a club to pulverize,
but wyvern claws slash or pierce, so the armor’s
bonus only applies to the latter.

Threat Dice

Threat Dice describe all attack forms available to a
creature. Such attacks are abstract, with weapon
modifiers used only where circumstances warrant,
and ability trees only considered for unusual or
Legendary opponents.

Creature attacks are classified as Melee, Natural,
Ranged,                              and Arcane.

These cover all attacks with hand weapons, natural
weapons (claws, teeth, hooves), missile weapons,
and magic respectively.

All humanoids possess a minimum of d4 in Melee,
Natural, and Ranged.

This would allow them to use close attacks with
melee weapons or ranged attacks with missile
weapons if they were available.

The GM should use common sense to decide
whether                         other creatures can use melee or ranged
attacks based on biology.

207


ENCOUNTERS


For instance, apes might easily use branches as
clubs                              and possibly use rocks as missiles, but normal
bears cannot throw stones.

A creature’s main attack is whichever attack form
has                             the highest potential harm (the threat dice with
the highest MV).

The maximum threat rank for a Minor creature is
1d12, for a Standard creature is 2d12, and for an
Exceptional or Legendary creature it is 3d12.

The creature's main attack must be the highest
threat                              rank among the categories and the other
categories must not equal or exceed the main attack
category.

For example, a minor creature with a d12 main
attack                                in melee can have a maximum of d10 in any
other category. A creature of standard type with 2d12
in the arcane attack category may have up to 2d10 in
any other attack category or other combinations,
such as d4 + d4 + d4.

An Exceptional creature can have up to 3d12 in any
category or combination of categories.

Generally, attacks by ferocious animals are Natural
(but                            may be as potent as weapons).

Some uncommon attacks are ranged, such as the
projectile quills of a manticore, the acidic spit of a
giant frog, or a behemoth that rips trees from the
ground to throw at human pests.

Arcane Attacks

Some monsters have the ability to attack using
arcane                             means, such as a dragon's fiery breath or an
energy bolt from a unicorn's horn. These types of
attacks are considered magical and use the Harm
effect by default. Arcane attacks do not require a
challenge die as an ability test, but some special
attacks that can add bonuses to damage or bypass
shields or armor require a test in the form of a saving
throw.

The default range of an arcane attack form is 10
Arcane                               MV in feet, with a radius or other dimension

of up to 2 × the MV of the threat level. Otherwise, the
range of spell-like attacks is determined by the
nature of the attack or by the range listed for an
equivalent spell. It will be noted if a creature is
capable of other magical effects or possesses innate
magical abilities resembling spells.

Threat Bonus or Extra Attacks

Some of the most powerful creatures have abilities
that                            allow them to inflict additional damage as a
result of their exceptional natural abilities, size, or
nature. This bonus, called the threat bonus, ranges
from +1 to +5 and is added to the category of threat
dice (Melee, Natural, Ranged, or Arcane) on each
strike.

Additionally, some monsters have special attacks in
addition to their normal ones. These special attacks
can be of any type (physical, mental, or magical) and
take any form (claws, bite, fire breath, psychic lash),
but they must fit within the creature's concept. If the
creature can perform multiple attacks, the threat
bonus applies to each roll. However, the bonus does
not apply to any additional attacks unless otherwise
specified.

The extra attacks are always occur one battle phase
after                             the creature’s regular attacks in the round.

This rule is designed to better simulate special
creatures                             with unusual attack combinations such as
hellhounds, multi-limbed demons or golems, giant
squid, giant snakes, dragons, two-headed giants
with mystic aptitudes, hydras, and so on.

Note that extra attacks (and modifiers to hit points)
based                             on size or supernatural properties can change
a creature's category.

For example, an otherwise minor monster with
great                             celerity that has three extra attacks a round,
even if none are above a single die, it is no longer a
minor creature because its maximum potential harm
per round has increased.

208


Creature Hit Points

Base creature hit points are calculated based on the
maximum value of their highest threat category.

This counts threat dice only, without extra attacks or
extra damage due to special effects or bonuses.

Hit points can be modified depending on the
creature’s size and nature, and the resultant HP
score is split as described below.

HP Modifiers

Size

Size is minuscule, tiny, small, medium, large, huge,
or                        gargantuan, as per the table.

Creature Size Modifier

• Minuscule or tiny modifier (mouse to cat): +0

• Small or medium modifier (goblin to human): +1

• Large modifier (horse, bear, tiger): +2

• Huge modifier (elephant, giant squid, wyvern): +3

• Gargantuan modifier (dragon, dinosaur, whale): +4

Nature

Nature is mundane, magical, preternatural, or
supernatural.                          Mundane creatures are normal and not
innately magical (although they may possess magic
abilities). Magical creatures such as unicorns are
innately magical, but not otherworldly. Preternatural
creatures include most magical monsters, generally
anything corporeal but weird. Supernatural creatures
are other- worldly and include incorporeal undead
such as ghosts, as well as angels and elementals.

Creature Nature Modifier

• Mundane (human, dwarf, wolf): +1

• Magical (fay, shee, werewolf): +2

• Preternatural (golem, hag, plant monster): +3

• Supernatural (demon, elemental, ghost): +4

209

Add the two modifiers together, halve that sum (do
not                             round), then multiply base hit points by the
result (round up).

The resultant single, abstract hit points score
combines                          Active (Prowess-based) and Passive
(Fortitude-based) defenses, making it very open to
GM narrative interpretation during battles.

Splitting HP —Active / Passive

Every creature’s hit points are split 50/50 to simulate
active/passive defenses. Creature hit points in the are
listed in the format:

HP: total (active/ passive defense) [constitution,
size,                       nature; HP multiplier].

Creatures in the game have hit points that are
divided                             into active and passive categories based on
their description, which can fall into the categories
of regular, tough, or fast. Regular split is 50/50%,
tough is 25/75%, and fast is 75/25%.

For example, a minor but large, fast-moving
serpent                              with a vicious bite might be a fast d12
creature, with 9 active and 3 passive hit points. This
split becomes important when certain feats or spells
bypass a creature's active defense points or
determine whether poison or other contact effects
are activated when penetrating active defense.

These rules are guidelines, and GMs may alter hit
point scores to suit the circumstances and their
conception of creatures. What seems right for a
monster is more important than the mechanical
application of modifiers. A large but unrobust
creature (such as a giraffe) or a not particularly
magical monster might get no modifier.

However, fragile creatures with strong attacks can
have                              their hit points reduced, while some creatures
can be made very hard to harm, although total
modifiers should not exceed +5. As noted under Extra
Attacks, modifiers to hit points based on size or
properties can change a creature's category. GMs can
also give monsters different HP splits, such as 20/80
or 66/34 if that fits the concept better.


ENCOUNTERS


Understanding Creature Defense

Active defense is a measure of a creature's ability to
actively resist or deflect attacks. Once this defense is
fully depleted, the creature becomes vulnerable to
specific effects that require breaking through its
active defense. Nevertheless, the actual impact and
consequences of an attack are determined by the
Game Master's narrative interpretation.

For example, if a creature with hit points of (33/101)
loses                               its initial 33 points of active defense, the GM
isn't necessarily compelled to portray the creature as
passively taking damage. It might still dodge or
relocate to elude the attack, but now it's susceptible
to effects that demand breaching active defense
points, like touch-based poisons or other afflictions.

Essentially, Active Defense engenders an 'effective'
shield                              - it blocks the activation of penetrating
factors like toxicity or other risky effects if the Active
Defense remains operative (i.e., maintains a score
above zero).

Damage Reduction

The rules for armor and shields in regard most
opponents                               are crafted for flexibility This framework
applies to all GM-controlled creatures, from the
ordinary to the extraordinary. The GM has the liberty
to apply the conventional method, using an armor
die to decide damage reduction, or a simplified
approach, assigning a consistent hit point bonus that
corresponds to the armor's quality and strength.

This decision is important for creatures of
remarkable                                 or legendary stature. The GM may
implement the actual roll of an armor die for tougher
opponents, usually those of exceptional or legendary
status, though it can lengthen the duration of
combat.

Simplified armor: GMs can enhance creature
durability                               by assigning "hit point" bonuses based on
armor protection die rank, ranging from zero for
lightly or unarmored creatures to +6 for those in
high-quality armor, like mithral or adamantine (d12

armor die). These points are added to passive hit
points.                            Shields, in contrast, directly reduce Potential
Harm:small shields by 1 point, medium by 2, and
large by 3. These "hit point" bonuses from normal
armor are not pre-included in the bestiary's base
stats, giving GMs flexibility to adjust challenge levels
in encounters. See also Special Opponent Defenses,
page 222.

Magic and Protection

Regarding spells influencing armor, the Protect
effect                                can either adhere to the conventional armor
rules, involving damage reduction dice, or they can
adjust a creature's hit points directly, in line with the
Armor Bonus HP chart. For instance, a spell
replicating the impact of a d10 armor might increase
or decrease a creature’s hit points by 5, influenced by
the spell's nature and its role in the game.

Natural Armor

Most normal creatures have damage reduction for
neither shields nor armor. Their HP score takes
normal skin, hide, or fur into account.

Legendary Damage Reduction

Legendary humanoid types and other creatures
wearing                           armor (such as horse barding), use armor
and shields in the same way as player characters by
default.

In Legendary creatures, armor reduces threat
points                               that surpass their active defense points based
on armor type and a die roll. Shields, however,
operate distinctly, offering fixed damage reduction
values: small shields reduce 1 point, medium shields
reduce 2 points, and large shields reduce 3 points.

These shields range from compact forearm guards to
substantial elemental barriers. Some creatures may
have natural or magical defenses akin to armor or
shields.

Creature Saving Throws

Monster and NPC saving throws come into play when
a                              magic effect, special power, or deadly trap triggers
a status effect (see Afflictions, page 245).

Every creature is assigned a Saving Throw rank,
usually                              from d4 up through d12, although, for
legendary creatures it can be up to d20+, which
applies to every situation requiring an opposed roll.
This usually represents Fortitude but can cover
more, either as noted on the creature description or
assigned by GM fiat. Some creatures have different
saving throws against different attack types, listed
after the basic one, e.g., ST d4; d10 versus Magic; 2d8
versus Melee feats.

Threat ranks may sometimes stand in as saving
throws                              (if indicated). For GMs making up opponents
on the fly, this table can serve as a rough guideline.

Creature Saving Throws

• Minor d4

• Standard d6

• Exceptional d8 to d12

• Legendary d14, d16, d18, d20, d24, d30

Battle Phase (Initiative)

During a round each creature acts in a particular
Battle                          Phase. There is no formula for this. It varies

ENCOUNTERS

Bear


for each monster and animal, so a small cat will act
before a large sloth.

It is loosely based on average or assumed agility or
prowess for the creature. The Battle Phase die can
stand in for agility or prowess as needed. Particular
opponents may have initiative modified by weapon
bonuses or other class-based or magical factors.

Creature Movement Rate

Movement in Eldritch is usually abstract, with the
GM                            tracking everything. If it is important, maximum
movement can be determined by the MV of the Battle
Phase die (standing in for prowess) for all creatures.

As a guideline, most humanoids and similar bipeds
can                              walk at 4 miles per hour (20 yards per 10-second
round). Most four-legged medium or large animals
have a base movement rate in mph corresponding to
their BP die MV (d4 = 4 mph up to d12 = 12 mph).

Smaller and larger creatures (minuscule, tiny,
huge,                       gargantuan) move at half the rate.

Running or charging is at twice normal rate, and
sprinting thrice. Especially speedy creatures
(antelope, cheetahs, horses without riders) can also
run and sprint more quickly: movement ×3 and ×5,
respectively.

Creature Example

We have a scenario in mind: “A Bad Bear Day.”
Wishing                                for there to be bears in our bestiary, we
create the statistics. Bears are tough, grouchy,
dangerous animals, thick-furred, not that fast, and
strong enough to crush foes in a brutal hug. Working
through the encounter details above, we decide they
pose a significant threat, and have natural armor and
an extra attack. Liking honey and hibernating in
winter have no bearing on game stats. We quickly put
together the statistics below – more than a bare
outline, but hardly an unbearable burden.

Type (TY): Exceptional

Threat Dice (TD): Melee zero ~ Natural 3d4, 3d6, or
3d8 ~ Ranged zero ~ Arcane zero

Extra Attacks (EA): 2d4, 2d6, or 2d8

Hit Points (HP): 18 (5/13), 27 (7/20), or 36 (9/27)

[tough, large, mundane; ×1.5].

Damage Reduction (DR): Shield 0, armor +3 to HP.
(thick fur).

Saving Throw (ST): d8

Battle Phase (BP): 4 (d6)

Notes: Bears are lumbering but dangerous if
provoked                                 or in a bad mood. The three listings are for
types of bear: black, brown/grizzly, and kodiak or
polar in that order. The main attack is clawing. The
extra attack is a bear hug, which only occurs if armor
is penetrated in the main attack.

212


Unusual Monster and NPC
Ability

Some legendary opponents are listed with several
dice                           for the basic ability even before considering
specialties.

In such a case, a specialty would add another die or
dice when using that ability branch, e.g., 2d6 (basic
Competence) + d8 (Perception specialty).

Threat Dice for some unusual monsters are
listed                         in exactly this manner. Some powerful
magic items and spells can also have

similar effects.

Treasure

The GM determines regular
equipment                 and treasure
depending on the type of creature
and encounter circumstances.

Opponents can carry
whatever         weapons and
armor suit their roles.

Adventurers like fortune hunters, explorers,
buccaneers,                            and swashbucklers typically carry
equipment appropriate to their experience and
power.

Specialized NPCs like infamous mages, reclusive
druids,                             and prominent theurgists often have magic
items. Commoners — serfs, menial servants,
ordinary soldiers, peasants, tavern keepers, hedge
magicians, and so on — carry whatever their station
entails.

Nobles often possess the highest quality clothes,
armor,                             and weapons, and typically wear fine jewelry.
Rogues and assassins carry thieves' tools, often
poison vials, and occasionally magic items designed
for deception.

Monsters from minor to legendary may possess
treasure                         depending on their ecology and culture.
Ancient hoards of hidden treasure can contain
whatever the GM wants, including powerful
guardians and deadly traps. The following table
serves as a quick guideline to treasure sizes.

Treasure Type—Value—Chance of Magic

• Trinkets: $1–5 —01%— 1 item

• Small cache: $2–20 —05% / 1 item

• Cache: $20–200— 10% / 1 item

• Small trove: $100–500— 20% d2 items

• Trove: $200–2000— 30% / d3 items

• Hoard: $1000–10,000— 40% / d4
items

• Dragon’s hoard: $10,000–
50,000+             50% d8 items

213


ENCOUNTERS


To determine equipment and treasure for
encounters,                               Game Masters can use the table provided
as a quick guide to inspire what loot and treasures
might be discovered during exploration or after
defeating foes (See magic items listings, page 181).

As described under equipment rules, dollar
amounts                                can be assigned to items in the game world,
making them comparable to things in our own world
(e.g. bread and ale for food, horse and cart or chariot
for transportation, etc.).

Suggested precious metal values are gold $500 per
coin,                              silver $10 per coin, and copper $1 per ten coins.
Coin weight is taken as an ounce each (but can be
anything you want from that to 100 per pound, as for
some ancient coinage). A little reading on ancient
and medieval history ought to give the GM sufficient
imagery for the rest.

NPCs

The rules for NPCs and monsters in the game aim to
streamline the GM's job and facilitate quick play.

While creating a “full-fledged” NPC is a legitimate
option,                            it is not mandatory. In cases where GMs
prefer to do so, these rules can help simplify the
process.

Most NPCs are categorized into four varieties:
minor,                        standard, exceptional, and legendary. They
use the normal monster statistical template rather

than a full character sheet. Nonetheless, GMs have
several                           options for creating NPCs. They can use the
conventional character creation procedures to make
a complete NPC and develop it to the desired level,
use one of the provided templates and modify it to fit
the NPC, or assign the appropriate values directly.

It's worth noting that character experience is
measured                               in level ranges, and the game doesn't
necessarily equate fighting power with importance. A
full-fledged character can serve various roles and
may be weaker than a standard adventurer.

NPC Level & CP Range Template

Level 1: 30 to 100 CPs, AAB

Level 2: 101 to 199 CPs, ABC

Level 3: 200 to 299 CPs, BCD

Level 4: 300 to 399 CPs, CDD

Level 5: 400 to 500+ CPs, CDE

Quick NPCs

Start with an Eldritch Character Sheet. Based on
character                            class or concept, decide on NPC level, and
his or her first, second, and third most important
abilities. Using the key below, allocate die ranks and
focus areas by the template letters above for NPC
level, left to right from least to most important.

A = Ability d4, 3 × Specialty d4.

B = Ability d6, 3 × Specialty d6, 1 × Focus +1.

C = Ability d8, 3 × Specialty d8, 3 × Focus +1.

D = Ability d10, 3 × Specialty d10, 2 × Focus +2, 4 ×
Focus +1.

E = Ability d12, 3 × Specialty d12, 3 × Focus +3, 3 ×
Focus +2.


Modify race and class specifics, adjusting
specialties                         and focuses to reflect unique traits.
Calculate defense scores, add class-appropriate
advantages, feats, and magic spells. Determine

214


equipment and treasure. Conclude with a concise
personality sketch and relevant campaign notes.

Complete NPC Example

To create Beraz, a level 3 dwarf warrior, we use the
level 3 template B Ability die, assigning B to

Race: Dwarf (male)
Skill       (total)

CPs:  260  (268)

Beraz


Competence, C to Fortitude and D to Prowess.

After assigning the die ranks, we adjust Fortitude to
dwarven minimum and decide Beraz would
concentrate on close combat, increasing his Melee to
d12 and decreasing Agility to d8, and his Prowess
determines his Battle Phase as acting 2nd in turn—a
dwarf with fast reactions.

We then work out defense scores. Beraz gets
warrior                               class feats, and race and class advantages.
Then it’s a matter of giving him typical gear: a great
hammer, chain armor, and a purse of gold. Since he
is third level, we add a magic item: a helm equivalent
to a small shield (he is very hard-headed).

As for personality and background, he is a gruff and
sturdy former dwarven delve guard off to seek his
fortune in the world and sample all possible ales long
the way. He knows of a likely treasure hoard under
the Iron Crags, but the way is perilous…

CREATURE TROPES

216


Creature Tropes


Ainerêve’s Eldritch Realms arise from the Meterea
(meh-TEHR-ee-ə)—a plane of chaotic ideas woven
from humanity’s dreams and collective unconscious.
Its energy suffuses every vision in this multiverse.

Where belief holds fast, dream-stuff coalesces into
the                             Settled Lands, a stable domain for both magical
and mundane denizens, with geography and
distances remaining fixed. Where myth splinters or
faith wanes, the raw, ever-shifting Unsettled Lands
endure—unpredictable and untamed, their distances
bending, stretching, and looping in the flux of chaos.

Among the most populous inhabitants are
humanoids:                              from the fecund, bellicose humans to
the myriad races of alfar and the cunning goblinoids.
Each people springs from Earth’s collective
dreaming, forging distinct societies, pantheons, and
legends. For the purposes of this chapter, we will call
these foundational figures “tropes”, examining their
categorization to aid Game Masters in encounter
design. A deeper exploration of their unique mythic
contexts follows later in this volume.

The Bestiary of Beings Diverse and Malign was
assembled                                 at the Octocirculi Academy under the
direction of Signoret and the scholars of the
Guardian’s Guild at Crossroads, with key chapters by
Bertrand Forthwind and the eccentric theorist
Symon. Although Symon’s “bubble reality”
hypothesis proposes countless other realms, this
compendium is strictly limited to the creatures
empirically documented within the Eldritch Realms
themselves. Housed in the Academy’s archives, it
remains the definitive reference for every known
archetypal denizen born of Meterea’s dream-
wrought tapestry.

Though most denizens remain blissfully unaware
that                           their world is dream-wrought, the creatures

within this bestiary are no mere fable. They are the
living embodiments of Meterea, the raw, unformed
substrate of existence and latent narrative
potential—the loom upon which all myth, matter,
and meaning are drawn.

Reifiants

Reifiants—named from Latin res (“thing”) and
reification—are                                rare, legend-forged archetypes
crystallized outright from Meterea when collective
belief and narrative focus becomes too powerful to
deny. They “arrive” fully formed, embodying the
Platonic ideal of their kind—alfar, fay, elves,
dwarves, goblinoids, giants, gods, or dragons—and
then seed their ordinary descendants through
procreation. Some even extend their will to spin self-
sustaining Volitional Demiplanes. Encounters with
Reifiants are momentous, for their mere presence
can reshape reality itself.

217


CREATURE TROPES


Lands of Stability and Flux.

Most tales unfold in stable domains—Settled Lands
in                               the Eldritch Realms—where myths anchor
Meterea into predictable geography. Bubble Realities
are vast, dream-forged universes; Eldritch Realms
contrasts these with Unsettled Lands—fluid margins
where belief falters and distances bend. Other
bubbles use their own terms for stable and fluid
regions. Universally, conviction creates stability;
fractured faith dissolves reality into responsive flux

Inklings, Extantars, and Aethelborn

These beings are parallel manifestations of
Meterea,                             arising through distinct mechanisms rather
than stages of development:

•Inklings are the rawest dream-spirits—flickers of
subconscious intent or emotion barely coalesced,
inherently unstable and ever-shifting.

•Extantars are perception-reactive entities whose
fluid                             forms morph with each observer’s expectations
and fears. Their being is driven by watching, not by
belief, and they remain forever mutable.

•Aethelborn (Aethelmúr) are stabilized forms—
often                            derived from Extantars—forged by focused
external will (divine command, unbreakable oath, or
potent artifact). Their fixed identity grants resilience
but makes them vulnerable to loopholes or
disruptions in their binding.

•Regular Ainerêve Denizens are mortals born in the
Settled Lands—humans, alfar, dwarves,
goblinoids—whose lives obey fixed laws. Though
their flesh and culture spring from Meterea’s
weaving of humanity’s dreams, stories, motifs,
beliefs, and myths, they remain unaware, believing
their world inherently real and reinforcing its
stability through daily tradition

Outlanders

Outlanders are rare souls plucked from Earth by
Revorage Rifts—portals yanked open by violent
dream storms. Whether a lone individual or a whole

village is swept through, their arrival point in
Ainerêve                             mirrors their collective beliefs. In ages past,
such arrivals seeded orders like the Templars of
Psarmoroum, reshaping the world’s map and
history.

Creature Design

For individuals wishing to explore outside the
recognized                           monster listings of the Bestiary, this
section offers creature tropes with guidance on
creating additional encounter possibilities. While the
preceding section on encounters explored the
technical aspects of creature creation, here the
emphasis moves toward a more general
classification so assisting Game Masters flexibility in
including these creatures into your game.

Creature Nature Classifications

Based on their natural traits, and physical attributes,
creatures                             in the Eldritch Fantasy Realms are
categorized as Mundane, Magical, Preternatural, and
Supernatural. These groups help to further define the
function of different creatures in the campaign by
allowing one to ascertain their degree of strength,
relevance, or threat they may present to player
characters.

Mundane creatures in Ainerêve fall into two
lineages:                               born natives and Outlanders. Ainerêve-
born denizens arrive fully formed through an
ongoing, culture-driven stabilization of Meterea
rather than a sudden mythic flash. Only ideas that
amass extraordinary, widespread belief crystallize
into Reifiants; most wildlife, artisans, warriors and
common folk instead enter the world by ordinary
birth within a Settled Land already anchored by
enduring traditions. This self-reinforcing loop of
family, custom and local legend smooths out any raw
dreamstuff flickers, so they never emerge first as
Inklings or fluid Extantars.

Outlanders come intact from Earth, “real by
definition”                           when they burst through Revorage Rifts.

218


They obey rigid terrestrial physics and carry an
Earth-shaped mindset that bends nearby dream-

currents in ways natives cannot. Their mere presence
can                             warp local reality, serving as sudden catalysts in
a world usually governed by slow, collective belief.

Together, these two origins occupy Ainerêve’s
“mundane”                             tier: one a steady, dream-wrought
emergence; the other an abrupt, outsider-driven
provocation of Meterea

Magical

Magical denizens—from fey and elementals to
mortal                            sorcerers, theurgists, and ritualists—tap into
ambient strands of Meterea without fully rewiring
reality’s loom. They identify themselves as
practitioners of arcane or divine magic, attributing
their abilities to elemental forces, sacred pacts, or
lineage. While they can conjure illusions, hail fire
from the sky, or commune with spirits, they remain
fundamentally corporeal—subject to gravity,
mortality, and most physical laws. Their gifts spring
from craftsmanship and precise resonance with
Meterea’s latent potential, not from the mass belief
that births fully reified beings.

Preternatural

Preternatural creatures straddle body and mind,
forged                              by nightmare storms, subconscious echoes,
or the restless churn of raw dream-stuff in the
Unsettled Lands. Undead driven by grief and rage,
shapeshifters who wear belief as a skin, and
nightmare-spawn that flicker at the edge of
perception all qualify. They defy mundane order—
walking through walls, warping flesh, oozing
dread—yet remain anchored enough to engage
physically, each uncanny ability hinting at the
deeper, fluid substratum of Ainerêve.

Supernatural Creatures

Supernatural entities are Meterea’s most refined
manifestations:                               gods, dragons, titans, angels, and
demons whose very essence springs from persistent
myth and collective belief. Though many preside
over self-wrought Volitional Demiplanes, those
realms are the product of their will, not the source of
their power. Often incorporeal or semi-tangible,
they brook no mortal laws or lesser magics;
wherever their inscrutable agendas unfold, reality
itself bends or shatters in their wake.

Creature Tropes Design

Whether you need simple stat blocks for quick
encounters                              or richly detailed denizens that deepen
immersion, you can tailor each creature’s design to
your campaign’s tone and your players’ preferences.
Below are exemplar tropes—each ripe for either
streamlined use or expanded into memorable NPCs
and adversaries.

Goblinoids: Cunning and covetous, goblins and their
orcish                                kin thrive on hoarded wealth and territorial
defense. Found in dank caves, ruined fortresses, or
shadowed forests, they blend bestial ferocity with
reptilian traits—sharp teeth, mottled hides, and
predatory eyes. Goblinoid societies center on
treasure accumulation, making them both intriguing

219


CREATURE TROPES


rivals driven by greed and dangerous foes defending
glittering                       hoards.

Alfar: Once a Norse term for elves and fairies,
“Alfar”                                 in Ainerêve encompasses a broad family of
magical humanoids: elves, dwarves, gnomes,
halflings, and their kin. Each race reflects its
preferred biome—mountain, meadow, or glade—yet
all share a spark of Meterea’s dream-stuff. Elves
bear delicate, pointed ears and deep bonds to arcane
lore; dwarves combine immense strength with
masterful craftsmanship; gnomes delight in
inventive trickery and arcane experiments; and
halflings charm with nimble grace and irrepressible
curiosity.

Dwarves: Solid as stone, dwarves carve their
strongholds                            into Grimsete’s peaks, the Sechdraic
Mountains of Dalmavand, and the deep halls of the
Northern Reaches. Renowned miners and smiths,
they prize endurance and precision, forging
legendary arms and armor while upholding ancient
clan traditions in song, stone, and steel.

Elves: Forest-bound and long-lived, elves thrive
where                            nature’s magic is strongest. In Meath Forest,
the Seelie under King Oberon welcome travelers with
illusions of beauty and wonder. In shadow-haunted
groves ruled by Queen Mab, Unseelie elves practice
darker arts—necromancy, blood magic, and curses
that twist hope into despair.

Halftings & Gnomes: Halflings, diminutive yet
daring,                             make their homes in the Fertile Glens,
Crossroads, and Avinoble’s sunny lanes. Their
mischievous spirit and quick reflexes belie a
fierceness when defended hearth and kin. Gnomes,
equally small, favor workshops and laboratories,
blending whimsical humor with ingenious arcanum
to craft marvels both delightful and dangerous.

Drakkin: Born of dragons and humans, Drakkin bear
scaled hides and wield elemental breath. Whether
patrolling Verdant Expanse’s mist-shrouded valleys
or navigating Dalmavand’s high passes, they blend
human ambition with draconic power—often

serving as warrior-scholars, mercenary knights, or
enigmatic guardians of draconic lore.

Mundane Creatures

Ordinary denizens of the Settled Lands, shaped by
Earth’s                            dreams but lacking any innate arcane spark.
Villagers, bandits, and wild animals can still threaten
unwary adventurers—especially in groups or when
led by a capable commander.

Supernatural Creatures

Supernatural creatures are Ainerêve’s
pinnacle                 Reifiants—gods, titans, dragons,
angels, and demon lords—drawn into being
through the weight of collective myth. Their
existence is sustained by enduring worship
and narrative focus, granting them a
permanence no ritual or mortal law can
undo. Though they may forge Volitional
Demiplanes, those realms spring from their
will rather than fueling it. As living
embodiments of archetypes, they ignore


Preternatural Creatures

Preternatural beings straddle the boundary between
flesh                             and psyche, born of nightmare storms, psychic
echoes, and the raw churn of Meterea’s undirected
dreams. They defy mundane laws while retaining
solid form, making them unpredictable and
dangerous.

•Minor (1 Threat Die): Skeletons (1d4), zombies
(1d6),                  doppelgangers (1d8), mimics (1d8)

•Standard (2 Threat Dice): Vampires (2d8),
werewolves (2d10), potent specters (2d10)

•Exceptional (3 Threat Dice): *Liches (3d10),
vampire                           lords (3d12), ancient shapeshifters (3d10)

•Legendary (3+ Threat Dice): Undead dragons
(3d12+),                         bound demons (3d12+), legendary
shapeshifters (3d12+)

* Liches—and similarly potent foes like vampires
lords—remain Preternatural because their power
stems from individual mastery of necromantic or
arcane rites, not from the collective belief that births
Reifiants. They’re undead or warped flesh-bound
entities—terrifying, yes, but still subject to material
laws. Only if a lich were raised into living legend by
widespread, enduring worship—its very name
woven into the world’s myths—would belief itself

anchor it as Supernatural. Without that cultural

mundane and magical limits alike, reshaping reality
wherever their inscrutable designs take root.

•Minor (1 Threat Die): Lesser angels and minor
fiends                             (1d8), local guardian spirits such as dryads or
nymphs (1d6)

•Standard (2 Threat Dice): True angels (2d10),
powerful                        demons (2d12), elder nature spirits with

•Exceptional (3 Threat Dice): Archangels (3d10),

Supernatural-Legendary (3+ Threat Dice): Gods and
goddesses (3d12+), primordial beings of immense

Legendary Creatures

In Eldritch RPG, “Legendary” is strictly a power
tier—it                            applies to any creature, regardless of Nature,
that wields three or more Threat Dice in a single
attack form and is the only category allowed die
ranks above d12 . Legendary foes also tend to boast
unique, high-impact abilities and occupy iconic or


CREATURE TROPES


narrative-central roles, marking them as the most
formidable challenges your players can face.

Special Opponent Defenses

Some foes gain unique defenses from their nature.
Fast                          creatures split their defenses 75% Active / 25%
Passive, so any feat that bypasses Active Defense
simply fails—they dodge too nimbly. Tough
creatures invert that (25% Active / 75% Passive), so
Armor-Bypass feats ignore their natural

armor and instead chip away at their
Passive Hit Points. For example, a
tough monster with a 4/10 Active/
Passive split (the +2 from leather
armor counted in Passive) has 4
Active and 12 Passive HP. An Armor-
Bypass attack that would deal 8
points instead drops its Active HP to
zero and then subtracts 4 from its
Passive pool, leaving 8 Passive HP.

Other special defenses include Ethereal beings,
immune                               to non-magical attacks; Elementals, whose
resistances and vulnerabilities follow their element;
and unique cases like gargoyles (stone hide) or
regenerators (slowly regain HP each round).

Unplanned Adversaries

When you need a quick monster on the fly, pick a
difficulty—Minor (1 die), Standard (2 dice), or
Exceptional (3 dice)—and roll those dice for both its
Hit Points and average damage.

Threat MV by Dice Combinations

For more nuanced foes, use the Threat MV by Dice
Combination table. Choose the creature’s attack type
(Melee, Natural, Ranged, or Arcane) and dice pool,
then look up its Maximum Value (MV) to see the
damage potential. From there, calculate HP based on
that MV plus any size or nature modifiers..

Threat MV by Dice Combination

1.Choose an attack form and dice pool. Decide
whether you’re building a Melee,

Natural, Ranged, or Arcane attack and
what                       dice (e.g. 2d6, d10+d4) it will roll.

2.Find your dice combination. Under
the                appropriate Threat tier (Minor,
Standard or Exceptional), scan down
the column until you locate that exact
dice entry.

3.Read the MV range from the first
column.                       The left-most column on the same

row gives you the Threat MV Range (e.g. “10–12”).
That                             range represents the attack’s damage potential.

4.Select your Attack MV. Pick a value—often the
midpoint                                or the maximum—in that range to use as
your creature’s MV for damage.

5.Determine Hit Points. Use the same Threat tier
(Minor                                → Standard → Exceptional → Legendary) to set
base HP, then apply any size- or nature-based
multipliers. Apply special defenses. Finally, layer in
Fast, Tough, Ethereal, Elemental, or other special
traits to reflect how the creature resists or amplifies
incoming damage.

Balancing
Encounters


Creating a balanced and engaging adventure in
Eldritch                            RPG 2nd Edition requires a careful mix of
encounters. The goal is to keep the players on their
toes, unsure of what will hit them next. This
uncertainty adds to the excitement and tension of
the game.

Encounter Difficulty

As a general rule, you can use a d10 to determine the
difficulty of encounters:

1-3: Easy

4-6: Moderate

7-9: Difficult

10: Demanding

This distribution is more challenging and is
suitable                             for games that have fewer encounters per
session or for experienced players who enjoy a
higher level of difficulty.

Alternatively, for a game that needs to move
quickly                             or for beginner players, you might use this
easier distribution:

1-4: Easy

5-7: Moderate

8-9: Difficult

10: Demanding

Formidable encounters should be placed
intentionally,                            often serving as boss fights or
climactic moments in the adventure. For example, if
you were designing a high-stakes adventure like

"The Perilous Depths of Despair", you would likely
only                          assign difficult, demanding, and formidable
encounters.

Random Encounters

Wandering monsters or random encounters usually
pose                            lesser threats. Their primary purpose is to
consume the party's time and resources if they have
been spending too long on their quest. For these
encounters, you might use a d6 to determine the
difficulty:

1-3: Easy

4-5: Moderate

6: Difficult

Encounter Difficulty Table

The Defense Level vs. Total Opponent Threat Score
Table can be a valuable tool for Game Masters to
design balanced encounters. It establishes a
correlation between the number of player characters
(PCs),                               their collective Defense Level (MV Range), and
various encounter threat levels.

The Defense Level is a cumulative measure of all
PCs'                             Active and Passive hitpoint scores. The threat
levels, classified as Easy, Moderate, Difficult,
Demanding, Formidable, and Deadly, signify the
degree of challenge presented by the encounters.

This table aids in ensuring that encounters are
appropriately challenging, enhancing the overall
gaming experience.

To create a balanced encounter using the table:

1.Determine the Defense Level range of your party.

2.Find the row in the table that corresponds to the
number of PCs in your party.

3.Locate the column in the table that corresponds
to                             the threat level of the encounter.

4.The value in the cell at the intersection of the row
and column is the maximum Defense MV for the
encounter.

5.Use the threat levels in the table to determine the
difficulty of the encounter.

For example, if you have a party of four Level 2
Competent (30-56) characters and you want to
create a Difficult Threat encounter, the maximum
Defense MV for the encounter would be 96.

To determine the composition of the encounter,
subtract                            the threat values from the appropriate
threat level column. Use the MV values to select
appropriate opponents, considering the limitations
of dice configurations (not exceeding 3d12).

Customize the encounter by selecting minor,
standard,                               or exceptional opponents based on the MV
and dice configurations, ensuring they align with the
chosen threat level.

Create an engaging and challenging encounter
using                             the determined opponents, considering their
abilities, attack dice, and hit points.

Creature Size, Nature, and
Encounter Difficulty

When designing encounters for your heroes, you
need                                 to balance several factors that affect the
difficulty of the encounter. One of these factors is the
threat mv score of the creatures, which measures
how much damage they can deal and how hard they
are to hit.

Another factor is the hit points of the creatures,
which                       measures how long they can survive in
combat. A third factor is the special abilities of the
creatures, which can give them an edge over their
opponents.

Hit points have a huge impact on the difficulty of an
encounter because they determine how many rounds
of combat the creatures can last. The more rounds
they last, the more damage they can deal and the
more chances they have to use their special abilities.
The difficulty of an encounter increases
exponentially with the hit points, much faster than
the rate at which it increases with the threat mv
score considered alone.

But hit points are not the only factor that affects
the                        difficulty. Some creatures have abilities that
make them more dangerous than others with the
same hit points.

For example, a medium creature that has
preternatural                           abilities increases one step in difficulty
than a normal medium creature.

A large, huge, or gargantuan creature that has
preternatural or supernatural abilities (has abilities
beyond the physical) is two steps harder than a
normal creature of the same size.

A magical creature may or may not be harder,
depending                               on what kind of magic it can use. Some
magic abilities, like extra attacks or breath weapons,
make a creature more threatening, but this applies to
any creature, not just magical ones.

Legendary creatures (those with special actions or
traits) can also be one step harder, depending on
their abilities and the number of heroes.

Too Tough Rule: If an opponent's hit points are too
high,                               the GM can reduce them to 1.5 times the party's
total maximum threat points per round. This rule is a
guideline, not a hard and fast rule, and the GM
should use their discretion. The rule is most useful
for large, powerful opponents and can be used to
balance encounters or create more challenging ones.

225


RULES ARBITRATION


Example of Encounter Creation

Balancing Threat Against the Party's Defense Level
The                           player characters consist of four player
adventurers whose combined defensive measures

equate to an “advanced” tier. As they ascend, they

face a deadly threat.

Emerging from a hidden cave is a monstrous
chimera,                              its lion, goat, and dragon heads ready to
attack. From the shadows slithers a gorgon, its
petrifying gaze threatening to turn them to stone. A
pair of harpies swoop down from above, and four
dire wolves encircle the party.

Total Threat Score Calculation

Chimera (MV 30): 80

Gorgon (MV 28): 80

Harpies (MV 18 each) x2: 80
Dire               Wolves (MV 8 each) x4: 40

Total Threat Score: 280 (Deadly Threat for a party
with                                a Defense Level of 280)

The values in parentheses next to the creature's
name                           represent their Maximum Value (MV) for their
most potent attack type. In this case:

Chimera (MV 30): This means the chimera's highest
potential                             damage output (its most powerful attack)
has a maximum value of 30. This is derived from its
Melee or Natural attacks, as indicated in its stat
block.

Gorgon (MV 28): Similarly, the gorgon's most potent
attack                                has a maximum value of 28.

Harpies (MV 18 each) x2: Each harpy has a
maximum                               value of 18 for its most potent attack.
Since there are two harpies, their combined MV is 36.

Dire Wolves (MV 8 each) x4: Each dire wolf has a
maximum value of 8 for its most potent attack. With
four dire wolves, their combined MV is 32.

The total threat score is then calculated by adding up
the MVs of all the creatures in the encounter: 80
(chimera) + 80 (gorgon) + 80 (harpies) + 40 (dire
wolves) = 280.

This total threat score is then compared to the
Encounter                          Difficulty Table to determine the
encounter's difficulty level for the party. In this case,
a total threat score of 280 corresponds to a "Deadly
Threat" for a party with a Defense Level of 280. This
means the encounter is designed to be very
challenging and potentially lethal for the
adventurers.

Quick Stat Block Examples

Quick Stat Blocks (QSB): Most creatures, whether
monsters,                            animals, or NPCs are categorized as
minor, standard, exceptional, or legendary, using
the QSB format, aiding in quick play and encounter
design. The template includes essential combat
attributes like Threat Dice (TD), Extra Attacks (EA),
Hit Points (HP), damage reduction (DR), Saving
Throw (ST), and Battle Phase (BP).

A creature's type (Minor, Standard, Exceptional, or
Legendary) is determined solely by the quantity of
attack dice in its highest Threat Dice (TD) category,
disregarding the specific type of dice or their
maximum values. Creatures with one attack die are
classified as Minor, those with two dice as Standard,
and those with three dice as Exceptional. Any (and
quite rare) creature possessing three or more attack
dice in any category is automatically classified as
Legendary, irrespective of its other attributes or
capabilities. Quick Stat Blocks streamline combat
encounters and can be listed as they are in the
beastiary section or in a compact format, as shown
below:

Chapter 9:

Arbitration


he game is organized like a reference
manual,                      but fear not, it does not

require an eidetic memory; nobody is expected
to                           achieve mastery of rules minutiae. Nor does it
assume the use of miniatures and tactical battle
mats. Instead, it provides straightforward rules
(and a few elaborations) based on simple
principles, covering most normal actions and
outcomes in the game, letting the GM use
common sense in unusual situations. The first
rule, though, is to see to the entertainment of all
players. The rules are designed to provide a
flexible framework that improves gameplay by
helping players vividly describe character
actions, bringing their ideas to life.

Once you understand the game's mechanics,
they                            serve the story, eventually fading into the
background. The game balances creative player
descriptions and the consistency provided by the
mechanical rules. It is also easy to tailor the
Eldritch RPG rules to suit your group’s unique
play style. The more complex game rules can be
introduced as and when the group is ready for
them. The other design principle is “nothing is
impossible,” which is why resolution favors

randomization, and we are careful to avoid
impossible target numbers and invincible
damage resistances.

However, adventurers do have plenty of growth
potential. Nothing is impossible given the right
tools, skills, and aptitudes.

Hero development through an unfolding story is
important and part of the fun of play. If at a
disadvantage by lacking a certain spell or combat
maneuver or magic item, the heroes can seek higher
knowledge, develop greater puissance, and quest for
mightier artifacts.

Game Balance

In a tabletop role-playing game, how is game
balance                         determined? At its most basic level, game
balance refers to rules that promote fair and
enjoyable play sessions for all parties engaged, with
the Game Master as the arbiter.

Game balance relates to all players' contributing
meaningfully                            to the success of an adventure session,
whether in combat, exploration, or interactions with
creatures encountered. The Plyphyny rules underpin
the Eldritch 2nd Edition game and are created with
the author’s preferences in mind.

Even so, mathematical equilibrium in all parts of
the                               play is not the Holy Grail. Without considering
the many possible milieux, the baseline for character
power and effectiveness is arbitrary. The character
concepts in this game are tropes, presented more
narratively than mathematically.

RULES ARBITRATION


As such, any standard class and race combination
costs                         between 70–96 character points, and are not
all equal in character point cost, as any curious
gamer with a calculator will discover. But players
may want to create their own variation, and so
guidelines for this are given below.

Custom Characters

The abilities of the Eldritch RPG in this 2nd Edition
revolve                            around Fortitude, Competence, and Prowess.
In essence, if broken down into the three archetypes
of Rogue, warrior, and wizard, the feats and powers
include everything the other classes do (i.e.,
assassins are a sub-type of rogue). A player can
achieve that with just those three classes as a
starting point. Each race and class ties well with a
specific stat; Warrior to Fortitude, Rogue to Prowess,
and wizard to Competence.

Eldritch has allowed players to create anything they
want but with some guidelines. If custom characters
are allowed in the game, or creatures featuring the
Mythic Physiology advantage, like the Drakkin, then
treat all characters as essentially custom, and grant
even the regular combinations of race and class an
extra 10 character points to spend (so a human or elf
would get 20 CPs not just 10).

With a warrior, the player knows the focus is on
combat;                              with a mage, it’s magic, and with rogue, it’s
utility or support. The specifics of their rogue,
warrior, or wizard are then up to the player. Just like
the assassin feats can go into the rogue archetype, all
magic-related feats go into the wizard archetype,
and so on. Wizards have access to all spell-like
powers. Warriors get access to all combat-like feats,
and rogues get access to all the utility feats. This is
how customized characters are created.

Players can choose one of the three archetypes and
choose feats and advantages or innate race/species
flaws from those listed below. They may choose 4
feats from one archetypal list or two from each of

two different archetype lists for unusual
combinations.

• Warrior, Rogue, or wizard + 10 CPs for a custom
class.

• Existing race + 10 CPs for a custom race.

• Mythic race (Drakkin or others in Ainerêve setting
book                       incorporating the Mythic physiology
advantage) + 10 Cps (plus 10 CPs to player characters
of normal races).

• 80 CPs for complete customization.

Players who want to play a more tribal/barbarian-
like                         character, for example, can choose the warrior
class and focus on the brawn/rage/survival stuff.

Alternatively, they may decide to play a knight-like
character                         instead and focus on weaponry, armor, and
shield feats and skills.

Alternative Focuses of Expertise

The focus areas as described are the tip of the iceberg
for                        customization. The areas provided represent the
most commonly used areas of knowledge or skill in
the game, but players may collaborate with GMs to
further customize their characters further, adding
new focuses at the regular cost granting bonuses to
specific situations.

Focus areas are either non-combat or combat-
oriented                            and will add a bonus to either an ability
check, potential harm, or initiative. Most often it is
Competence → Expertise that’s easiest to expand,
with endless possibilities in areas of knowledge:
Diplomacy, Mathematics, Astronomy, Military
Tactics, Religion, History/Lore, and so on.

Pick four feats from one list or two feats from two
separate lists.

Focus Swaps

When creating a character, players have the option to
swap their racial focus bonus for a focus bonus
related to one of the base minimum specialties of
their chosen class.

230


This allows characters to further customize their
abilities                             and better align their focus bonus with their
chosen class. If the chosen class has more than one
base minimum specialty, the player can choose to
swap the racial focus bonus for a focus bonus related
to any of these specialties.

If the chosen class has only one base minimum
specialty,                           the player has two options: he or she can
choose a focus that is not already granted by the
class, or take a 4-point discount on another focus,
spend an additional 4 points, and raise it to +2.

Archetype feats and
advantages

Choose 4 feats from one archetypal list or two from
two                            different lists.

Collaborating with the GM

Eldritch RPG's character creation system is designed
to                                be flexible, allowing players to combine various
abilities, specialties, and focuses to create unique
and powerful characters. Players who wish to work
with their Game Master (GM) to create new content,
such as races, species, classes, or a combination of
these elements, will find detailed guidelines in this
chapter to ensure that new content integrates
seamlessly with the game's existing mechanics.

To further customize their characters, players can
select                                new focus areas that provide bonuses in
specific situations. Players can collaborate with their
GM to create additional focus areas, as long as they
adhere to the game's structured cost and bonus
rules.

Example Classes:

Archer: Uses Prowess to enhance Precision, focusing
on                            Ranged Threat and Ranged Finesse to attack from
a distance. Archers can select feats from the Warrior
list or collaborate with the GM to develop custom
feats.

Bard: Uses Competence to enhance Expertise with a
focus on Wizardry, and Adroitness with a customized
focus on Musicianship to cast spells and perform
music, aiming to support and control crowds.

Beastmaster: Uses Competence to enhance Expertise
with                               a custom focus on Animal Handling and
Perception with a custom focus on Nature

command them in battle and navigate the
wilderness.

Chronomancer: Uses Fortitude to enhance Willpower
and                           Wizardry with a custom focus on Temporal

Challenge Levels

The “Challenge Levels” table helps determine the probability of a character succeeding in an 
ability test
against                                                                  various difficulties. To 
use it, first identify the relevant Basic Ability and Specialty for the action—for
example, Competence and Perception. Then, determine your Ability Level by combining the die ranks 
of the
Basic Ability and Specialty; the total number of dice rolled indicates your Ability Level (e.g., 
rolling 2d6 makes
you “Respectable”). Next, find the Challenge Difficulty assigned by the Game Master based on 
difficulty
levels: Easy (d4), Moderate (d6), Difficult (d8), Demanding (d10), or Formidable (d12). Consult the 
table to
locate the intersection of your Ability Level and the Challenge Difficulty to find your chance of 
success. If the
challenge is tougher and attempted “With Disadvantage,” the GM rolls two challenge dice, reducing 
your
chances as shown in the table’s second column. Note that Focus bonuses add to your roll after 
consulting the
table but aren’t included in the probability calculations. Ties favor the player character.

Arbitrating Opposed Rolls

In the Eldritch RPG, ability tests are used for most
actions                                to determine outcomes. It may be helpful to
review the rules in Chapter 2, Action System, to
provide additional context.

Challenge rolls come in two main types: situational
and                         contested. Situational challenges typically
involve a physical ability or test of skill, while
contested challenges involve active opposition from
a living opponent.

To make an ability test, players choose one ability
branch                            and roll up to two dice to try to meet or
exceed the GM’s challenge die roll or the challenge
roll required for activation by a spell, magic item, or
special power.

It’s worth noting that saving throws are different
from                         opposed rolls, in that they help against effects
that bypass other defenses.

Saving Throws

Saving throws are used specifically to resist severe
effects,                        whether magical or otherwise, that would
bypass other defenses, such as poison or afflictions
like mind control or incapacitation.

When making saving throws, characters can resist
spells,                           innate abilities, and special combat feats
where opponents roll against them. While such rolls
are typically used when a character’s active defenses
are bypassed, it may not always be clear when to use
opposed rolls instead of saving throws. This is by
design to give Game Masters more flexibility.

When a character needs to make a saving throw, he
or                                she uses the appropriate ability and add together
the rolls for each die in the ability branch. Other
creatures, on the other hand, are assigned a saving
throw rank, which is a die or die combination that
applies to every situation requiring an opposed roll.

Saving Throw Categories

There are three categories of “saves” in the Eldritch
RPG:                        Cognitive, Skillful, and Valorous.

The standard saving throw ability branch is Ability →
Specialty → Focus.

Cognitive Save

Cognitive saving throws are used to resist effects
that                         involve mental manipulation, deception, or
other cunning tactics, such as resisting mind
control or illusions.

Competence → Adroitness → Skulduggery or
Cleverness:                      Characters can use their adroitness in
skulduggery or cleverness to avoid or manipulate
potentially harmful situations, such as avoiding
traps or convincing an NPC not to attack them.

Competence → Expertise → Wizardry or Theurgy:
Characters                            can use their expertise in Wizardry or
theurgy to protect themselves against magical harm,
such as creating a magical barrier or dispelling an
enchantment.

Competence → Perception → Alertness or
Perspicacity:                       Characters can use their alertness or
perspicacity to notice and avoid dangers, such as
spotting hidden traps or detecting an ambush.

Magic Defense Saves

Besides the spell powers provided by the Gift of
Magic                           advantage, at Tier 2, magic-wielders gain
access to the Magic Defense benefit (see page 23),
which allows them to use their active defense pool to
simulate protective energy in addition to other more
common activities like parrying and blocking or
dodging. This energy also helps shield them from
nonphysical magical damage, such as psychic
attacks.

However, Magic Defense — using the active
defense                              hit points — won’t protect against magical
effects that require a saving throw, such as magical

235


RULES ARBITRATION


affliction effects. Rather, it allows a saving throw
option                             for a caster trying to deflect or mitigate the
effect of an affliction effect spell. Simply use the
Competence → Expertise → Wizardry or Theurgy
branch if that is more advantageous than the other
option.

Skillful Save

Skillful saving throws are used to evade or handle
threats                            through physical agility, melee combat, or
ranged combat, such as dodging incoming
projectiles or parrying an enemy's attack.

Fortitude → Endurance → Resistance or Vitality: Used
in                            vitality or resilience to resist physical harm, such
as withstanding a powerful attack or resisting the
effects of poison.

Fortitude → Strength → Ferocity or Might: Used in
ferocity or might to endure physical pain and push
through adversity, such as resisting torture or
breaking through an obstacle.

Fortitude → Willpower → Resilience or Courage: Used
in                            courage or resilience to overcome mental harm,
such as breaking free from mind control or resisting
the effects of fear.

Valorous Save

Valorous saving throws are specifically for resisting
effects                           that require physical or mental fortitude,
such as resisting poison, enduring physical harm,
or breaking free from mind control.

Fortitude → Endurance → Resistance or Vitality:
Used                            in vitality or resilience to resist physical
harm, such as withstanding a powerful attack or
resisting the effects of poison.

Fortitude → Strength → Ferocity or Might: Used in
ferocity                                or might to endure physical pain and push
through adversity, even in dire circumstances, such
as resisting torture or breaking through an obstacle.

Fortitude → Willpower → Resilience or Courage: Used
in                            courage or resilience to overcome mental harm,
such as breaking free from mind control or resisting
the effects of fear.

“Twisted” Ability Saves

In addition to the standard ability branch, the
Eldritch                          role-playing game permits twisted ability
branches. Twisted branches combine abilities with
specialties and foci from other branches (See Chapter
2, Action System, Twisting Branches). When crossing
over from other branches, twisted branches are
represented by a plus sign instead of a right facing
arrow.

For example:

Cognitive:Competence + Willpower + Courage.
Skillful:                    Prowess + Strength + Ferocity.

Valorous: Fortitude + Courage + Resilience.

Agency Saving Throws

When an ability or spell incorporates Defense
Negation—completely bypassing a character’s
Active Defense points and preventing any parrying,
dodging, or other active defense actions—an Agency
Save may be attempted. This save is crucial when
typical cognitive, skilled, or valor saves are
unsuitable. The Agency Save is calculated using one
of the following formulas, depending on the threat's
nature:

• Competence + Mastery + Level

• Prowess + Mastery + Level

• Fortitude + Mastery + Level

If no mastery slot is available, the calculation
defaults                                to the base ability score plus one point per
level. The attacker's challenge die-rank determines
the difficulty of the save. A successful Agency Save
allows the character to use their Active Defense
points, nullifying the negation effect. However,
threat points still account for the attack's base
potential harm, requiring other defenses to mitigate
damage.

Agency Saves also apply in cases where standard
saves                              are inadequate, such as complete
immobilization from magical bindings or paralysis,
and instantaneous debilitating effects from certain
magical traps. Optionally, using an Agency Save may
require spending two Spirit Points

Mastery in Eldritch RPG

The Mastery Die in Eldritch RPG acts as a versatile
tool                               for enhancing a character's abilities. It can be
added to any ability test, improving chances of
success in various actions like climbing, persuasion,
or deciphering ancient texts. In combat, it can be
used to boost attack rolls, increasing the potential
harm inflicted on enemies. It can also enhance the
effects of Iconic Items, making these unique
possessions even more powerful. For magic-
wielders, the Mastery Die can be instrumental in
ensuring the successful execution of spells.

Characters have a limited number of daily uses for
the                             Mastery Die, determined by their level. While the
daily usage is capped, they can use it multiple times
within a single encounter or challenge. The 'Master
Twist' mechanic, triggered when rolling the Mastery
Die's minimum value with an iconic item, allows for
a re-roll, turning potential failure into success. In
the context of Path Magic, the Mastery Die also
offers a re-roll when a 1 is rolled, reducing the risk of
spell failure. Lastly, even when daily uses are
exhausted, the Surge action allows for an extra
Mastery Die roll at the cost of spirit points.

The Effects of Magic


elve into the mystical realm of
spellcasting as we explore the

foundations of game spells and power effects,
designed                          for advanced GMs and players eager to
improvise or forge new spells. Magic effects
comprise six categories: Activate, Afflict, Harm,
Modify, Protect, and Restore (and its inverse
Destroy), each hosting specific associated spells.

Activate covers eclectic spells that escape
categorization,                  including temporary powers,
divine favor, non-combat spells, and enhanced
luck.

Afflict encompasses spells inducing negative
status                       effects like confusion, mind control, and
paralysis.

Harm effects are magical attacks that deliver
threat                          points, bypass defensive measures such as
armor and active defense points, or amplify the
potential harm.

Modify effects enhance or curse abilities or
equipment,                          ranging from weapon augmentation
to enemy cursing.

Protect effects consist of magical shielding,
armor,                        protective walls, and immunities, proving
invaluable for defensive and support characters.

Restore spells remedy injuries, cure diseases,
alleviate                  fatigue, rejuvenate the soul, and

can even resurrect the dead, while Destroy
effects                   unleash devastating consequences,
such as obliteration or disintegration of

objects or beings.

Wizards (mages or adepts) and theurgists
(priests                              or druids) tap into distinct magical
sources but may evoke similar spell
manifestations. Wizards wield arcane energy to
command preternatural forces, whereas
theurgists direct divine or spiritual power via
connections to deities or nature. Irrespective of
power origin, mortals are incapable of countering
spells cast by gods or avatars without legendary
means or immense sacrifice, as divine beings
possess power surpassing mortal boundaries.

Magic’s potency hinges on the wielder’s skill and
ingenuity rather than the source. The challenge
rating of a spell or magic effect dictates the bonus,
change, modification, or increase/decrease in die
size steps: d4 (±1), d6 (±2), d8 (±3), d10 (±4), and

d12 (±5).

Spell Potency, Challenge and Rarity

Potency Level 1: d4 / Common
Potency               Level 2: d6 / Uncommon
Potency Level 3: d8 / Esoteric
Potency Level 4: d10 / Occult

Potency Level 5: d12 or above / Legendary

EFFECTS OF MAGIC

240


Activate

An Activation is a miscellaneous effect that causes
something to exist, or an event to happen, utilizing
magic not otherwise covered.

This includes the generation, dismissal, or
manipulation                              of substances or energies (elemental
spells), the summoning or translocation of creatures
or objects (as with conjuring spells), or an effect set
off by a contingent circumstance (which falls under
various categories of ritual magic and magic Magic).

Boon

A boon is any activation effect that grants a person or
group some general advantage in dangerous or
challenging situations.

Such spells represent magic spells of utility,
expeditiousness,                           or convenience to the heroes. For
example, hastened travel through difficult terrain,
the ability to breathe underwater, or the favor of the
gods in battle (see spell listings for examples).

Summoning

This activation effect allows a magic practitioner to
summon creatures from common beasts to demons
and elementals, banish said creatures to another
dimension, forcibly teleport a victim elsewhere,
conjure or dismiss an object, or even open rifts for
travel by “summoning” named places.

A basic summoning spell calls some specific object or
creature type per round, each incurring separate
spell maintenance penalties. The range is the line of
sight, up to Competence die MV × 2 in feet. The test
can be modified by the size and magical nature of
some creatures, as below.

The summoner can banish a monster under his
control                          without effort. However, if he loses control
over a summoned creature, a battle of wills ensues
(relevant magic-based ability branch versus the
monster’s main attack: its highest threat dice).

Summon Creature

The creature materializes at the chosen destination
point                             (which must be a safe place to manifest, or the
creature gets an immediate special saving throw to
break the spell: summoned dice value vs. the spell
roll). After the first round, a summoned creature gets
to roll its highest threat dice every round versus the
caster’s Fortitude → Willpower → Courage or relevant
magic-based ability branch, whichever the player
prefers, to break free of the spell. If the conjured
creature wins the contest, it vanishes or may attack
the caster (GM’s discretion).

The basic ability test to summon a creature
depends                               on its type, as below. The penalty is applied
if the summoning fails.

Creature type / examples / difficulty / penalty

•Minor: cat, rat, bat / d4 / spell fizzles

•Standard: goblin, human / d6 / –1 spirit points

•Exceptional: manticore, gargoyle / d10+2 / –2 spirit
points

•Legendary: giant, dragon / d12+2 / –3 spirit points

Modifiers for Summoning Spells:

Offsetting these modifiers may require spirit points’
expenditure, costing one spirit point per nullified
penalty point. Note that some creatures are
impossible to summon improvisationally without
powerful assistive magic (as determined by the GM).

Apply –1 to the ability test for each threat rank above
4                            (applied to all threat dice equally), up to –5
penalty. Hit points are determined as per the rules in
the Game Mastering section, Encounters.

241


EFFECTS OF MAGIC


Size Modifiers:

•Large: -1 penalty on the ability test, hit points
doubled.

•Huge: -2 penalty on the ability test, hit points
tripled.

•Gargantuan: -3 penalty on the ability test, hit
points quadrupled.

Nature Modifiers:

•Magical: -1 penalty on the ability test, hit points
doubled.

•Preternatural: -2 penalty on the ability test, hit
points tripled.

•Supernatural: -3 penalty on the ability test, hit
points quadrupled.

If a creature’s challenge die is at its maximum, such
as                                a 3d12 for a supernatural demon, the penalties
from size and nature are consolidated and then
divided by the number of threat dice to adjust the
summoning challenge accordingly.

Example: Consider the summoning of a medium-
sized,                        supernatural demon with 3d12 threat dice. The
base challenge for this summoning is d10+2,
increased by +3 due to the creature's supernatural
nature, culminating in a d10+5 challenge for the
summoning roll. Once summoned, the creature’s
attempts to break free of the spell’s control
commence from the second round onward.

Each round, the demon rolls its highest threat dice
against the caster’s chosen magic-based focus area,
like Fortitude or Willpower, to escape control. To
mitigate the risk of the demon breaking free, the
caster can use spirit points to offset the demon's
escape attempts. For each round, one spirit point can
be spent to reduce the demon's threat dice by one
level, thereby increasing the caster's chances of
maintaining control.

Swarm Summoning

A summoner can also choose to cast a swarm
summoning,                           conjuring multiple very weak creatures,
whether a horde of imps or a swarm of bees. The
number of creatures summoned is equal to 2 × the
MV of the challenge die chosen, and each creature
has 1 threat point and 1 hit point. The creatures act as
one group, with initiative equal to the caster’s
Expertise rank. Swarms are always instinct-driven,
and while able to follow simple commands, they
never possess real intelligence or significant
equipment.

Swarm ability test = d4 through d12.

A standard spell maintenance penalty kicks in on the
second round, determined by the original test. The
summoner can command a swarm or minion horde
to attack in the same round they appear. The spell
operates much like a regular area effect Harm spell,
with the swarm attacking as many targets as it can
surround, but unlike such a spell, the swarm damage
is divided among those trapped by the summoned
attackers. That means one defender caught takes the
full brunt, but many take less potential harm since
the attackers are split between defenders.•

242


Banish Summoned Creature

Banishment requires exceeding the test roll needed
to                            summon the targeted creature. Success means the
summoning is broken, and the creature will vanish.

Any failed attempt to banish a summoned creature
also                           allows it an immediate saving throw to break
free of the original summoner’s command. All
practitioners of magic know when a summoned
creature under their command is subject to an
attempt to banish it.

Ritualized Creature Summoning

The ritual summoning of creatures increases spell
duration and does not incur maintenance penalties
but rather requires a focus object that must not be
broken during the intended duration.

The amount of time required to perform a ritual is
equal to its desired duration. The summoned
creature can attempt to break free after each
multiple of that duration (the creature rolls its
highest threat die rank versus the magic-wielder’s
Fortitude → Willpower → Courage or Competence →
Expertise → Wizardry ability branch, as the player
prefers).

Therefore, a ritual requiring two rounds to
summon                                  a goblin lets the goblin attempt to escape
after every two rounds (so it could be free on the
third). However, if it remains controlled for three
months, the conjured creature becomes a permanent
resident of the summoner’s settled land. After that,
the creature may attempt to break free of the spell
once a year or if forced into suicidal actions. If
successful, the creature may attack or return to its
home plane or wander at will.

Summon Object

Objects conjured for entertainment, like a colorful
explosion                            of flowers, or small harmless items, are
handled via common cantrips (automatic or d4).
Sometimes the GM may allow an automatic success
with a cantrip if not casting a spell under duress.

Conjured objects are not illusory; each will have the
expected mass and weight and possess structural hit
points in that general range (GM decides). Such
creation is not ex nihilo, but instead pulling an object
from near or far (even if whereabouts are unknown).
Summoned objects materialize where desired within
an allowable range if the space is free of any creature
or solid object. They remain so long as the spell is
maintained. These objects will be as envisioned, e.g.,
lamps will be lit and filled with oil if so desired. The
summoned objects can also be used as a means of
attack, within limits, say, by dropping an anvil out of
the sky (see Conjured Items as Hazards).

The object is normally one of the following: one
piece                                 of regular armor, a weapon, a container, tool,
wheeled vehicle, or mount, a plant, money (copper,
silver, gold, platinum, mithral, gems), one ration, or
clothes. Objects must be mundane and common to
the experiences of the average adventurer. Ignorance
of how an item works will not hinder the
effectiveness of a conjuration spell. For example, if
someone conjures a padlock it will work (so long as
he conjures a key to accompany it). He does not need
to be a locksmith to do this.

Of course, this leads to interesting questions; how
hard                              would the lock be to pick? What if he wants to
create a silver dagger rather than one made of steel?
How heavy is a conjured boulder? How much money
can a magic-wielder create out of thin air? These
sorts of questions are answerable with impromptu
GM arbitration, but there are general standardized
parameters. The challenge dice and modifiers for
object summoning are as follows, on the Object
Summoning Difficulty table:

243


EFFECTS OF MAGIC


Object Summoning difficulty

•d4: Minuscule (up to 5 oz), e.g., ring, mug; or
Tiny (up to 5 lb), e.g., coconut, breadbox.

•d6: Small (up to 50 lb), e.g., saddle, chair.

•d8: Medium (up to 300 lb), e.g., anvil, desk.

•d10: Large (up to 2,500 lb), e.g., boulder, wagon.

•d12: Huge (up to 25,000 lb), e.g., boulder, siege
engine.

•d12+2: Gargantuan (up to 50,000 lb), e.g., boulder,
small                          ship.

Object summoning ability test modifiers

•–1 per 50 coins worth of precious metals or gems.

•–2 for a set of related objects (e.g., clothing, armor,
bag                              of coins).

•–2 per 10 feet above target (for dropping objects in
attack).

•–4 for complex objects with moving parts or gears.

Conjured Items as Hazards

When a conjured item is made to fall from the sky or
to                           materialize in a motion that could impact
someone, such usage is generally handled like a
standard attack spell where damage is determined by
the attack roll. For further refinement and additional
details, the rules found in the Hazards section of
Chapter 7 should be consulted. In instances where an
object is falling, damage should be calculated based
on both the size of the object and its height above the
target.

The following guidelines are suggested for damage
based                              on every 10 feet of fall: Small objects: 4 threat
points. Medium objects: 6 threat points.Large
objects: 8 threat points. Huge objects: 10 threat
points.Gargantuan objects: 12 threat points.These
threat points should be applied up to a maximum fall
distance of 100 feet, to acknowledge the impact limit
imposed by terminal velocity. Beyond this height, no
additional damage should be accrued.

For defense against these hazards, characters can
apply                             their Fortitude-based points to reduce damage
before it impacts their hit points. This reflects their
ability to potentially withstand or mitigate the
impact to some degree.

Indirect Attacks vs. Direct Hazards: For indirect
attacks                               like rolling boulders or toppling doors, which
typically cause less damage than direct drops, they
remain harder to avoid. Consequently, the threat
points for these are the same as direct impacts,
though no saving throw is allowed, which
underscores their unpredictability and immediate
danger.

Ritualized Object Summoning

Items conjured by ritual do not incur maintenance
penalties                            but rather become the spell’s focus objects
and remain in existence for the spell’s duration. A
tiny or bigger object requires one round to cast per
challenge die increase (see above).

The preparation time used in the ritual determines
the                          frequency of the conjuration’s renewal
requirement. If the magic-wielder spends two
rounds to conjure a small wagon, they must perform
the ritual every third round.

Teleportation

Teleportation per se is like summoning but usually
involves                          magic recipients sending themselves, other
creatures, or objects somewhere else.

Note: Mortals cannot generally perform such a feat
in                          Ainerêve, this sort of effect being the province of
the gods or supernatural beings there.

The place where creatures or objects are sent must
be                                in sight, visited before, or studied extensively in
books and accurately envisioned. Successful
teleportation to a place inaccurately envisioned may
result in going astray by 2d6 miles. Teleporting to
the wrong place is immediately intuited if the

magic-wielderhas visited the place before.

There is also the option to teleport the unwilling to
unsafe locations, near or far: this allows saving
throws.

244


Creatures teleported away against their will are
permitted                                 an opposed roll every round of the
encounter to break the spell’s power. Success means
the banishment is ended, and the one affected
returns to the very spot occupied before he was
whisked away by magic. Failure to save means the
creature remains stuck, and the next save at a
penalty of –2, and so on until there is no escape. If a
saving throw becomes impossible, the spell no
longer needs to be maintained, and the affected
creature remains where it was sent.

Teleportation difficulty

•Challenge d8: Teleportation of self or another
willing                            creature, or small objects, only short
distances (distance traveled is default range: up to 10

× basic tier MV in feet).

•Challenge d10: Teleportation of creatures (including
self)                               or up to medium-sized objects, up to base
ability MV in number, up to miles equaling the
branch MV. One test covers all affected.

•Challenge d12: Actual personal travel to other
planes                               of existence for self and other willing
creatures (including carried objects), up to base
ability MV in number. Unwilling creatures get a
saving throw each round (with an increasing
penalty) and must be maintained until the affected
cannot possibly win an opposed roll.

Teleport Attuned Items

A magic practitioner can summon a unique existing
item                                to their hands if they have owned it for at least
one lunar cycle and have carved their sigil into it. The
distance determines the test according to the
teleportation (not summoning) rules. Attuned
objects can include branded horses and wagons
engraved with the sigil (see Attunement Sigil, under
Wards & Runes in the Arcanum chapter), allowing for
a traveling party’s mass teleportation. Attuned items
stay once summonedTeleport Attuned Items

Wards →Attunement Sigil), allowing for traveling
parties' mass teleportation. Attuned items stay once
summoned.

Afflict

Affliction effects are magical effects that can
override                                 a target’s free will or cause permanent
changes to its mental, spiritual, or physical state,
requiring an opposed roll against the caster’s ability
test. They can be used in creature powers, NPC
abilities, and traps. Defense scores cannot block
Affliction effects, and only saving throws can resist
them. These effects can stun, slow, distract,
incapacitate, or magically control the mind or body.
Any affliction caused by an instant spell lasts for one
round unless the specific spell description states
otherwise.

Saving Throws

Saving throws against Affliction effects let
characters                          use skills, luck, and abilities to avoid,
counter, or reduce harmful conditions.

Cognitive saving throws protect a character’s
judgment                          from mental manipulation and illusions.

Skillful saving throws help characters avoid or
evade physical threats beyond active defense hit
points.

Valorous saving throws resist poisons or let one
break free from a villains’ magical commands.

245


EFFECTS OF MAGIC


Lingering or Permanent Conditions

Affliction effects can also cause persistent status
conditions,                            such as pain and fatigue, that impede a
character’s abilities even after the affliction’s
primary cause has ended. To handle these effects, the
following guidelines can be implemented:

Recovery: Determine the natural healing rate for
each                            ongoing effect, taking into account factors such
as the character’s overall health and the severity of
the affliction.

Remedies: For each effect, identify appropriate
treatments                          such as healing spells or medical
procedures. Determine their effectiveness with
ability tests. The rules allow for customization and
the addition of new focuses. For example, a
Competence → Expertise + Medicine focus might
grant bonuses to ability tests related to
administering medical treatment.

Long-term consequences: Consider any permanent
injuries                             or penalties that may result from ongoing
effects. Players may collaborate with GMs to use
existing flaws or introduce new flaws that reflect
lingering or permanent conditions resulting from
afflictions. These flaws grant extra Character Points
that can be used elsewhere.

Game Masters should aim for a balance between
realism                              and playability when creating consequences
for afflictions. This means avoiding excessive
bookkeeping or overly punishing consequences
while ensuring that the consequences make sense
within the narrative. Ongoing effects from afflictions
can provide immersive gameplay experiences that
challenge players and serve as a reminder to avoid
future afflictions.

Physical Afflictions

Slow (Challenge d4): Reduce the target’s initiative
by                               one battle phase (effectively reducing the basic
Prowess rank by one full step, for example, from d10
to d8). Increase the difficulty of the magic-wielder’s
test by +1 when slowing the target two battle phases,

+2 for three battle phases, and so on. A victim can be
dropped down to below a d2 basic Prowess, with
movement reduced accordingly.

Knock Prone or Knock Back (Challenge d6): The
target                               must make a Skillful saving throw. On a failed
save, the target is knocked prone or knocked back,
depending on the spell or feat used. For spells,
knockback distance is determined by the caster’s
Willpower die rank in feet, reflecting their control
over magical energy (e.g., 1d8 feet for a d8
Willpower). For feats, knockback may be based on
the attacker’s Strength die rank. A successful save
avoids the effect. Knockback may trigger opportunity
attacks if the target ends within another creature’s
reach.

Stun (Challenge d8): The target may not move or
attack                               for one full round. It is considered temporarily
incapacitated and may be more vulnerable to certain
effects or attacks.

Debilitate Sense (Challenge d10): Cause total
blindness                               or hearing loss, meaning most
Competence → Perception checks using that sense
automatically fail (GM's discretion; compensating
for the loss may allow a roll with a –5 penalty). This
effect can severely hinder the target's ability to
interact with their surroundings or detect threats.

Paralyze (Challenge d12+1): The target is physically
immobilized and loses access to any defense points
but can still use innate aptitudes or cast spells with
no somatic components (see Spells without Gesture
or Word). It is unable to move or perform physical
actions.

Incapacitate (Challenge d12+2): The target becomes
unconscious, falls to the ground, and is vulnerable to
attack. The saving throw required to resist this effect
is based on Fortitude. Attacks on incapacitated
targets bypass defense points and shields, directly
reducing the target’s Fortitude. However, armor may
still provide protection during general melee
encounters.

246


Mental Afflictions

Distract (Challenge d4): This spell renders the target
indecisive and uncoordinated, disrupting their
ability to cast spells and perform complex actions
effectively. The reduction in the target's initiative is
calculated by dividing the caster's ability test roll by
six, rounding up the result. This reduction directly
impacts the target’s Prowess die rank or battle
phase, thereby slowing their response time and
affecting their order of action in combat scenarios.

Confuse (Challenge d6): The disoriented target
struggles                               to focus on actions, disrupting
concentration and hindering abilities. If engaged in
close combat, he or she triggers an opportune attack
unless using tactical withdrawal. Unable to attack
until the same battle phase next round, he or she can
move, support, or help in other ways. This subeffect
is more severe than ‘Distract,’ potentially
incapacitating or causing unpredictable actions.

Terrorize (Challenge d8): The target is stricken with
fear,                              may not attack the magic wielder, and will run
for its life until the next battle phase next round. If
anyone (even the caster) stands in its way, though, it
will attack him or her to try to get past. If those
standing in the way of the fleeing creature are allies,
an immediate Fortitude → Willpower save is allowed
to prevent the creature from trying to violently force
its way past.

Inftuence Mind (Challenge d10+1): The caster can
manipulate the target’s thoughts, emotions, or
perceptions, causing it to experience altered beliefs,
emotions, or sensory input. This subeffect allows for
a variety of mental manipulations, such as
implanting suggestions, altering memories, or
creating illusions.

Dominate Mind (Challenge d12+2): Grants the caster
total                           control over a target’s body and mind. Victims
may be forced to attack friends or perform unwilling
tasks. This effect represents extreme mental control.

Harm

The Harm magic effect enables spellcasters to inflict
physical                               harm on a target using various magical
means, such as elemental spells, wizardry, theurgy,
and psychic attacks. A basic magical attack with the
Harm effect targets a single creature within the
caster’s line of sight and maximum range. The mage
rolls the relevant ability branch dice for threat
points. To overcome a target’s passive defense, the
spell’s Harm energy must penetrate active defense
hit points. Armor may mitigate or block residual
damage, while some spells can bypass armor or
active defense (see page 75).

Harm Spell Challenge

A zero-challenge Harm spell is a standard attack roll
and                                thus requires no test. Such a magical attack
inflicts potential harm equal to the relevant ability
branch dice. To increase the threat points of a Harm
effect, casters must perform an ability test against a
challenge die. If successful, the spell inflicts
additional harm, but even if it fails, the basic
potential harm still occurs. The table below shows
the challenge die and corresponding threat point
increase:

Challenge die d4: +1 threat point.
Challenge                     die d6: +2 threat points.
Challenge die d8: +3 threat points.
Challenge die d0: +4 threat points.
Challenge die d12: +5 threat points.

Magical Ranged Attack Forms

Bolt: Appears as a missile of some substance or a
visible                             effect up to 1 foot in diameter that streaks
towards the target (e.g., an ice spear or glowing ball).

Burst (area effect): Burst attack spells usually appear
as                                 a bolt that expands or explodes on reaching the
targeted point. The area affected is usually the radius
of ability branch MV ×2 in feet, double that for
mastered spells. A cubic volume will be up to 2 ×

247


EFFECTS OF MAGIC


basic tier MV in feet for height, width, and depth,
double                             that for mastered spells. An area effect spell
increases the test by one die rank. If a spell’s failure
was associated with an area effect spell in a burst
effect or area of effect (2x Competence → Expertise
MV + Wizardry or Theurgy Bonus MV, radius), then
creatures within the radius take half threat point
damage.

Stream: A continuous line of effect up to 2 feet wide
originating from the caster (e.g., an arc of flame).

Non-Physical Potential Harm

The distinction between parrying, blocking, or
dodging                               is narrative, determined through Game
Master and player collaboration during action
sequences. As such, although a player would not
describe use of active defense points as ‘parrying or
blocking’ an intangible bolt of energy, the character
could technically dodge, and in terms of game
mechanics the active defense points are reduced in
the same way.

Intangible, Non-lethal Attacks

However, some manifestations of spell energy
negate                              various defenses. Unblockable by ordinary
shields or swords, they require a minimum challenge
die of d8. Some non-lethal, non-physical attacks
subdue rather than kill, such as illusory threat
points, which are mitigated by a successful saving
throw before affecting passive defense. This mode
can render targets unconscious but not take them
below below zero passive defense.

Invisible, Intangible Attacks

Invisible and intangible psychic attacks, another
form                                 of non-physical harm, target the victim’s mind
or spirit directly, bypassing physical defenses. These
attacks may induce mental or emotional distress,
manipulate thoughts, or even cause debilitating pain.

Invisible spell energies can be challenging to detect
or                            defend against, often requiring specialized
magical defenses, heightened perception, or innate
psychic resistance. Despite their intangible nature,
some psychic attacks can still be evaded or resisted
by a target’s mental fortitude or innate ability to
counter psychic energy.

Certain classes can use the Magic Defense advantage

to defend against intangible magical

attacks (see page 187 and page 87).

Defense Negation

Defense negation is a powerful tool in a spellcaster’s
arsenal,                          allowing the caster to bypass a target’s
defenses at the cost of 1 spirit point for every die rank
of the spell’s final challenge rating. If the caster does
not have enough spirit points to pay for defense
negation, he or she cannot use this ability.

Bypass Armor (d4 to d12; 1-5 Spirit points): The
spell                               can negate the target's armor up to the
maximum allowed by the spell. The challenge die for
this effect is equal to the armor's die rank, making
the spell's effectiveness contingent on the strength
of the target’s armor.

Bypass Shield (d8 to d12; 3–5 spirit points): The
spell                             negates the opponent’s physical or magical
shield up to the maximum allowed by the spell. The
challenge die = d8/d10/d12 for a small/medium/large
shield, with a spirit point cost of 3/4/5 respectively.

Bypass Armor (d4 to d12; 1–5 spirit points): The
spell                               can negate the target’s armor up to the
maximum allowed by the spell. The challenge die =
the armor die, with a spirit point cost of 1 per rank (1
at d4 up to 5 at d12).

Bypass Active Defense (d12; 5 spirit points): The
spell                          negates the target’s active defense up to the
maximum allowed by the spell. The challenge die =
d12 with a spirit point cost of 5.

248


For all forms of defense negation Harm subeffects,
a                              spell created with the subeffect alone can be
maintained to keep the target vulnerable to
subsequent attacks from others until the maximum
duration, following the universal spell maintenance
rules.

Collateral Hazards of Magic

Latent hazards are secondary consequences that
occur                               when a spell interacts with particular materials
or conditions. A spell’s latent hazard only activates if
the target’s protection is vulnerable to the
manifestation. However, objects and vulnerable
materials may still be affected or damaged by area
effect spells. As a rule of thumb, the GM may add +2
threat points for such interactions. However, the
most potent activation of such a hazard can be
triggered by a player character rolling the maximum
value on the mastery die (when that option is
invoked) or when using an iconic magical focus.

Examples of collateral hazards include:

Magical Combustion: Flammable objects in the area
may ignite due to the spell, causing larger fires and
damage to structures or additional targets. Single-
target effects include ongoing damage from burning
clothing or gear.

Enchantment Weakening: Area effects may damage
enchanted structures or objects made of affected
materials, while single-target effects may weaken or
break magical armor or gear.

Fragile Object Shatter / Mystical Air Disruption:
Area                             effects may shatter delicate objects and cause
difficulty breathing or concentrating due to mystical
air disturbances, while single-target effects may
break fragile items and affect the target’s breathing
or concentration.

Arcane Shock / Ground Tremor: Area effects may
cause                           muscle contractions or arcane energy surges,
making the ground unstable. Single-target effects
may knock the target prone or cause muscle
contractions or arcane energy disruptions.

Armor Ignition / Magical Force: Area effects may
cause                          discomfort or additional damage to creatures
wearing enchanted metal armor or hurl unsecured
objects with magical force. Single-target effects may
cause discomfort, additional damage, or knock the
target prone.

Modify

The Modify effect allows a spellcaster to modify the
target                            creature’s attributes or abilities. This could be
to modify attack potential, transform victims or
allies into other creatures to either benefit or
severely hinder, transmorph objects, augment
senses or natural abilities, and so on.

Modify Vulnerability

The Modify Vulnerability subeffect allows spell
crafters                                to create spells that bypass shields, active
defenses, or armor, either as an inherent property of
the spell formula or as optional casting modifiers for
increased flexibility. It can be combined with a Harm
effect to enhance the potency of an attack spell by
bypassing defenses that may not have been
vulnerable to non-physical or intangible energies.

Up to six variations of vulnerability can be
incorporated                             into a spell, individually or in
combination, enabling even materials and armor
types that are not normally vulnerable to specific
types of damage to become susceptible.

Armor Negation: Challenge equal to armor die-rank.

Shield Negation: Ability test penalty of –1 to –3;
added only as a spell modifier option.

Active Defense Negation: Minimum challenge of d8
to                           eliminate descriptive blocking or parrying
possibilities, d10 to eliminate blocking, parrying, or
evading, and d12 to eliminate dodging and leaping
out of the way.

249


EFFECTS OF MAGIC


Incur Material Vulnerability

This targets specific materials or armor weaknesses,
making                            them more susceptible to a chosen magical
manifestation. The Modify Vulnerability subeffect
can trigger latent hazards if the caster’s Expertise
rank is equal to or greater than the spell’s Challenge
Rank. These hazards inflict potential harm equal to
the spell’s Challenge Rank and can be triggered by
rolling the maximum value on the caster’s mastery
die or by using an iconic magical focus.

Heating or Freezing: Area effects can freeze or melt
objects                             made of affected materials, while single-
target effects can cause ongoing damage from
freezing or melting. Additionally, area effects can
ignite flammable objects, resulting in larger fires and
damage to structures or other targets, whereas
single-target effects can cause continuous harm due
to burning clothing or equipment.

Weakening (or Embrittling): Area effects may
damage                           structures or objects made of affected
materials, while single-target effects may weaken or
break armor or gear.

Sundering (Shattering, Ripping, Tearing,
Crumbling,                              or Fragmenting): Potential harm equal
to Challenge Rank. Area effects may break fragile
objects and cause damage to structures, while
single-target effects may break, tear, or shatter
armor or gear.

Transmogrify

Creature Shapeshift

Transmute Creature (d8; 3 SP): The caster can alter
hair                             and skin color and texture, height, weight, and
gender within the caster or target species' norms.

Shapeshift (d10; 4 SP): Can change size (in the range
tiny,                            small, medium); alter type into goblinoid,
animal, aquatic, or vermin. (Add +2 challenge per
change in a size outside the given range.)

The target gains any racial abilities; height, weight,
and                            gender are under caster control but must fall
within the new form’s norms. Equipment held or
worn melds into form, reappearing when the effect
ends. The caster can know one form per specialty die
rank, unless the new form is improvised, costing a
Spirit Point.

Greater Shapeshift (d12; 5 SP):A shapeshifting
master                                can transform into any living being at will,
from a mouse to a dragon, shifting once per round as
long as the spell is maintained. The recipient of this
power can transform into a giant or legendary beast,
changing its size to large, huge, or even gargantuan.
The target gains all of the form’s physical special
attacks and defenses but does not gain modifiers to
overall hit points based on the form’s size or nature.

Transform (d12+2; 6 SP): The target gets all of the
form's                             physical special attacks and defenses, and for
a short time, they also get the size or nature-based
HP or defense bonuses. This effect can also turn
another creature in sight into something inanimate,
like stone or another hard substance, making it
helpless until the spell is broken. Allows a saving
throw if the target is resisting.

Note: If the caster wishes to grant the target size or
nature-based HP or defense bonuses, they must add
a +4 challenge modifier for each bonus type applied
(e.g., +4 for size-based HP, +4 for nature-based
defense). The base number is for a giant beast; the
test should harder for legendary beast forms, say,
from +4 for a werewolf to +8 for a ghost to +12 for a
dragon (GM’s call).

250


Object Transmutation

Morph Object (d4; 2 SP): Change size or weight by
one                           category (see Table—General Categories of Size
and Weight) or alter an item’s color or shape.

Altering clothing or accouterments in this manner
adds                          +1d4 to Disguise checks.

Shapeshift Object (d8; 4 SP): Change an item from
one                             thing into another, although material remains
the same. Size and weight can be shifted by one
category (e.g., change a wooden desk into a chair).

Transform Object/Area (d4 to d12+2; 6 SP): Change
hardness, mass, or state (liquid, solid, or gas) or an
object’s composition. Transmute lead into gold. The
effect is temporary and must be maintained (see
alchemist or magic item creation rules for more
information).

Object Change Adjustments

–1 to test to affect multiple objects (1 per die rolled).

–2 to test per extra size or weight category change
(per                         object).

Note: A set of clothing or armor, or a pile of coins or
pebbles, counts as one object for these effects.

General Categories of Size and Weights: These table
categories are rough guidelines; the example objects
are ‘open’ in form. The structural hit point range
indicates general item robustness but bringing an
object to zero hit points is rarely necessary to make it
dysfunctional. Breaking something is not as difficult
as reducing it to rubble or powder.

Alter Ability; Bonus or Penalty

This magical effect alters a target’s ability by either
enhancing or hindering its die rolls. Those affected
by the Modify Ability penalty do not receive a saving
throw. A bonus can be granted to oneself or another
creature within range.

Typically, this effect targets a single ability for
augmentation. However, targeting multiple abilities
or creating an area of effect is possible, which
increases the spell’s difficulty and maintenance
penalty.

Ability test = 1 challenge die rank increase per static
bonus                              or penalty affecting single, targeted ability. No
higher than ±5.

The challenge die always increases by one step for
each static bonus or penalty affecting a specific,
targeted ability (to a maximum of ±5 bonus or
penalty). Add 1 step to the challenge die for each
additional ability influenced by the spell.

Furthermore, increase the challenge die by 2 steps if
the                              spell is transformed into an area effect (e.g., a fog
cloud affecting all Competence → Perception rolls).

Alter Ability Limitations: Self-inflicted ability
reductions                              (die rank or straight penalty) are not
possible, even under mind control or when
accidentally activated by reading a spell scroll (which
differs from a cursed item). Hit points (defense
points) cannot be directly increased or drained .

Similarly, temporary penalties affecting a
character’s                             targeted ability, such as a –2 to Strength,
do not impact the passive defense pool. Apply –4 to

EFFECTS OF MAGIC


the ability test for a selective area effect (all of one
group — allies, foes, or creatures — are affected).

Sense Roll Alteration

This effect allows the practitioner of magic to alter
his                              or her own or another target’s senses, such as
sight and hearing, either enhancing or disabling
them to various degrees.

Ability test = 1 challenge die rank increase per static
bonus                             or penalty affecting single, targeted sense. No
higher than ±5.

Debilitate Sense, in Afflictions above, is more
severe                                but allows a saving throw. Apply –2 to the test
if affecting a sense other than sight or hearing (i.e.,
taste/smell or sensation).

Die Rank Augmentation

The spellcaster can increase the die rank of any tier
of                                 a target’s ability branch. This can help with
challenge rolls and physical saving throws, but never
increases the target’s normal defense points.

Ability test = 1 challenge die per die rank increase to
a                          maximum of d12.

A bonus +1 die rank increases the die rolled from a
d4 to d6, a d8 to d10, etc. These die rank increases
can be applied to the basic or the specialties tier.

Examples: d4 to d6 is challenge d4; d8 to d12 is
challenge                              d6; d4 to d12 is challenge d10. This power
cannot increase any trait or skill that has no existing
rank.

Die Rank Reduction

The spellcaster can decrease the die rank of any tier
of                                a target’s Prowess or Fortitude ability branches.
This can hinder challenge rolls, physical saving
throws, battle phase order (or random Agility rolls),
but never decreases the target’s normal defense
points (unless used in conjunction with a Harm
effect).

Ability test = 1 challenge die per die rank decrease,
down                            to d4.

If the target already has a d4 in the targeted trait or
skill,                               then the challenge die is d4+2: this imposes a –
2 on all the targeted ability’s rolls if successful.

Examples: d6 to d4 is challenge d4; d12 to d8 is
challenge d8, and d12 to d4 is challenge d12; d4 to
d4–2 is challenge d4+2.

Absorb

The Absorb subeffect allows the caster to convert
potential                             harm into a temporary increase in the
caster’s active defense points or spirit points. The
maximum threat points that can be absorbed with
each attack against the target is determined by the
spell’s challenge die rank, ranging from 1 to 5 points,
with any remaining threat points affecting the caster
as usual. The spell’s total absorption limit is
determined by the spell’s challenge die MV to a
maximum of 12 points (at d12), with the temporary
points pool remaining as long as the spell is
maintained.

The Absorb subeffect can only convert harm that has
not                              already been blocked or absorbed by other
effects, and adding it to a spell will add a step to the
total spell challenge rating.

Weapon Enhancement

A single-effect Modify spell that features an increase
to                                a mundane weapon’s potential harm always
requires a test to avoid damaging the weapon.

The caster increases or reduces a weapon’s harm or
initiative bonus as follows:

Ability test = 1 challenge die rank increase per static
bonus                              or penalty affecting the single, targeted object.
No higher than ±5.

252


Object Durability

The magic-wielder increases or reduces an object’s
hardness                            (thereby increasing or diminishing
structural hit points).

Ability test = 1 challenge die per 20% of item’s hit
points                          increased or diminished (e.g., Ability Test = d8
at 60%)

Diminishing an object’s hit
points                   by 100% allows an item a
saving throw (bronze 3d12, iron
2d12, stone 2d10, brick 2d8, wood
2d6), else the object shatters or
crumbles.

The caster’s Competence

branch MV × 2 determines base cubic
feet                 affected for sizeable wooden
objects: base structural HP are 1 per
cubic foot of wood, 2 for stone, and 3
for metal. Doors are medium to large
(10 cubic feet for a sturdy single door
to 50 cubic feet for large double
doors), and walls are huge.

Object Repair

This is a rather subjective category of
magical                       alteration. The GM decides if it is
difficult to repair some object
circumstantially, deciding whether it is a task

that is easy (d4), difficult (d6), demanding (d10), or
formidable (d12).

Area-Effect Modification

(Casting modifier only.) The spell’s effect can be
transformed into an area effect, extemporizing the
targeting from creature to area. The radius equals
the linked spell’s ability branch MV in feet. Failure
means only the normal potential effect applies.

Protect

Magic that provides damage reduction (DR) or cover
to                                an individual or multiple targets is divided into
shield, armor, protection wall effects, and immunity.

Protection Examples

Sorcery: Toughen skin, change physical resistance,
make                        immune to physical attack.

Thaumaturgy: Summon armor or shields or
translocate                         attuned magic items capable of
generating force fields and other shielding powers.

Elementalism: Create barrier walls of stone, wood,
bronze, iron, force; walls of fire, water, wind.

Assume pure elemental form, gaining varied levels of
physical attack immunity.

Hieraticism: Call upon gods or spirits to shield
from                     harm, either damage reduction or
various immunities granted for one or
many.

Mysticism: Generate kinetic shields.

GM Note: GM Note: Players may creatively
activate                    spirit points to mirror some of the

protection effect examples given above.
However,                magic-using classes may use
spirit points to interrupt attacks in any
battle phase, their effect is always instant,
and their manifestation dissipates
immediately.

Armoring Effects

Practitioners of magic provide
themselves                      or recipients with magical
protection, whether conjuring a suit of

armor out of thin air or generating a
force field that envelops and moves

with the body. The manifestation depends on the
source of magic: magical armor, force fields,
conjured armor, hardening of the skin, etc.

All armoring effect spells grant random damage
reduction,                             rolled just as regular armor. The magical

253


EFFECTS OF MAGIC


armor die value is used only when the beneficiary’s
active                            defense points are exceeded. The challenge die
to cast the spell equals the level of magical armoring
effect, regardless of how it manifests. If the recipient
is already wearing armor, whether normal or
magical, do not roll both damage reduction types;
instead, roll the higher of the two. If the magic
armoring effect is of a lower die rank than armor
already worn, add +1 bonus DR per die rank to the
regular armor to simulate the spell’s augmentation.

Shielding Effects

A shielding spell reduces potential harm even before
the                           defender uses active defense. It might be a
conjured magic shield appearing in the recipient’s
free hand or a semipermeable energy field generated
around the body. Unlike regular shields or parrying
weapons, such magic damage reduction works even
when the protected recipient’s defense points are
exhausted.

Challenge: d4 = -1 threat reduction, up to d12 = -5
threat reduction.

Shielding spells affecting an area do not work like
walls                               but move with the group protected. For
example, a spellcaster may create a shimmering and
strangely viscous membrane centered on moving
with him and his companions. If the recipient is
already holding a shield, whether normal or magical,
do not apply the static damage reduction twice;
instead, add all bonuses together, divide by 2, and
always round up.

Walls of Protection

Barrier walls provide total cover for those standing
behind                             them. Their area equals the ability branch
maximum in feet for length and height, but they can
be reshaped at casting. The base wall type is packed
earth or matted vegetation, with structural hit points
equal to the caster’s ability branch maximum. The
difficulty of an individually learned spell determines
maximum thickness. Spells can be created to

increase the wall substance and its structural hit
points (equal to the caster’s relevant Expertise
branch MV).

Penetrable Elemental Walls

Walls made of fire, wind, or water usually provide
total                               cover directly in front of the caster. Mages are
most learned in Elementalism (pertaining to fire, air,
water, earth, and energy), though priests can invoke
similar effects. Rather than ranged attacks whittling
down their structural hit points, as with most total
cover, such walls impose a –4 threat point reduction
to ranged attacks. This is due to the opaqueness of
fire or partial opacity and rushing movement of wind
or water elemental walls; it is difficult to target those
hiding beyond. Unless made to surround the caster,
the typical elemental wall spell provides good (¾)
cover further out to the sides but no cover behind.

Passing bodily through such a wall also has
consequences.

Elemental Immunity

Spells can grant elemental immunity against natural,
non-magical elements like fire, electricity, wind, or
environmental hazards. These are commonly used by
mages exploring elemental planes. No spell confers
total immunity to magical harm. Mythical creatures,
particularly primordial beings, may possess
immunity to specific elements. Elementals and
transformed mages are immune to their respective
elements. Incorporeal undead are immune to energy
attacks, while corporeal undead are affected.

Physical Attack Immunity

Physical attack immunity provides short-term
protection                             from normal weapons, unarmed attacks,
and natural attacks of beasts. Immunity difficulty
ratings are d8 for one of those attack forms, d10 for
two and d12 for three. Any extension (e.g. to hazards)
will incur high maintenance costs and often cost
spirit points as well.

254


GM Note: Elemental transformation spells may grant
immunity but limit offensive options. For example,
air or spirit form mages face difficulties in physical
attacks and spellcasting. Some elemental forms, like
fire or energy, allow attacks using the caster’s basic
Competence → Expertise dice. .

Disease and Poison Immunity

Mages, adepts, mystics, and theurgists can use
rituals                              or spells for disease or poison immunity.
Adepts may create magic items or potions granting
immunity, either maintainable (costing spirit
points) or permanent until dispelled.

Restore or Destroy

This section outlines the effects of divine magic
spells                               for the purpose of aiding in their creation and
understanding. See Chapter 2 for more information
on Theurgist Feats.

Divine healing in the Eldritch RPG 2nd Edition rules
encompasses spells meant to heal and protect.

Theurgists, who gain power from gods, and druids,
who                           channel divine energies from nature, can cast
these spells. They can heal injuries, cure diseases,
counter poison effects, restore lost ability die ranks,
regenerate limbs, and replenish spirit points.

Challenge rolls determine the success of some spells.
Divine                          healing spells are particularly useful during
extended battles since the active defense pool
requires rest to replenish. Restored hit points cannot
exceed the target’s maximum score.

Here are the key divine healing spells and their
mechanical aspects:

Bolster: A burst of divine or natural energy fills the
target,                        invigorating body and mind, and helping it to
withstand further attacks. Test: Competence →
Expertise + Vitality. Challenge: d4 for active hit
points or d6 for passive hit points. Replenishes active
or passive hit points by the amount rolled.

Mend: The priest or druid channels healing power
into                                the target's wounds, stitching flesh together
and knitting bones back into place. Test: Competence

→ Expertise + Vitality/Resilience. Challenge: d12.
Restores                              both active and passive defense points by
the roll of the tested ability branch.

Cure Debility: The priest or druid channels
restorative                              power into the target, strengthening
weakened limbs and renewing vitality. For more
severe afflictions, this may require a ritual
purification or exorcism. The spell restores
temporarily lost ability die ranks at a spirit point cost
equal to the die rank MVs. In rare cases of permanent
reductions (such as those from powerful curses,

epic-level traps, or voluntary character
disadvantages),                              the cost is in Character Points equal
to the die rank MVs. These instances require divine
intervention and are treated as major narrative
events. Test: Competence → Expertise + Vitality.

Challenge: Special.

Heal: The priest or druid invokes the divine or
natural                           forces of life, calling upon them to mend
even the most grievous of injuries and renew the
target's spirit. Test: Competence → Expertise +
Vitality/Resilience. Challenge: d12. Restores active
and passive defense points by the roll of the tested
ability branch.

Negate Affliction: The priest or druid purges the
target's                            body of harmful toxins or infections, using
either natural remedies or divine intervention to
drive out the disease or poison. Test: Competence →
Expertise + Resistance. Challenge: strength of
poison, disease, or condition. Removes affliction or
poison effect.

Regenerate: The priest or druid channels powerful
restorative                            energies into the target, causing limbs
and organs to regrow and wounds to knit together
with supernatural speed. Test: Competence →
Expertise + Resilience, Challenge: d12. Instantly
regenerates defense points equal to the ability test
roll. Limb and organ regrowth occurs over time: 1

EFFECTS OF MAGIC


round for a finger or toe, 5 rounds for a hand or foot,
10                            rounds for an arm, leg, or internal organ
(including skin).

Rejuvenate: The priest or druid pours vitality and
energy                             into the target’s body, causing wounds to
close and fatigue to dissipate, leaving it feeling
rejuvenated and ready to fight on. Test: Competence

→ Expertise + Resilience. Challenge: d8 active or d10
passive. Replenishes hit points by MV of the tested
ability branch, with failure incurring a spirit point
cost equal to half the amount healed, rounded up.

Spiritual Revitalization: The priest or druid restores
the                            target’s spiritual energy, whether through
prayer, meditation, or some other means,
reinvigorating body and mind with renewed zeal and
vigor. Test: Competence → Expertise + Vitality,
Challenge: d6 random or d8 fixed MV restoration
points. Restores spirit points.

Spiritual Smite: The priest or druid calls upon divine
or                            natural powers to imbue his or her weapon or fist
with explosive energy, then striking a foe with a
mighty blow that sends it reeling. Test: Prowess →
Melee or Precision + Theurgy. Challenge: d8 (+3
threat) to d12 (+5 threat).

Supernatural Intervention: The priest or druid
makes                                a desperate plea to the gods or the forces of
nature, calling upon them to intervene in the battle
at hand. The result can be anything from a subtle
nudge in the priest’s or druid’s favor to a
catastrophic upheaval of the battlefield, depending
on the deity’s whims. Test: Competence → Expertise

→ Theurgy, Challenge: 2d12.

Dark Invokers (Destroy
Effect).

Theurgists who embrace hatred, corruption, and
cruelty                              to bring ruin to the holy and tyranny to the
weak are known as dark invokers. They are feared
alongside master summoners of demonic powers,
evil sorcerers, and aberrant thaumaturges who pose
a threat to heroes in the Eldritch Realms.

Among them, the necromancers are considered the
most terrifying. Their magical abilities are powerful,
wild, and dangerous, manipulating body and soul
magic, using the corpses of former foes to do their
bidding, or consulting the spirits of the dead to
magically reveal the future or influence the course of
events. The most infamous necromancers have
raised undead armies or lived unnaturally for
hundreds of years.

For the particularly nefarious Game Master, the
powers of dark invokers are detailed below, with
representative spells covering more than just
restoration magic’s inversion.

Execration

Test: Fortitude → Willpower + Ferocity

Challenge: Special. The caster chooses one of the
afflictions from the Effects of Magic; Slow d4 /

Knock Prone d6 / Stun d8 / Debilitate Sense d10 /
Paralyze d12 / Incapacitate d12+2 / Distract d4 /
Confuse d6 / Terrorize d8 / Control Mind d10+1 /
Possess Spirit d12+2.

256


Description: The caster invokes his or her source of
evil                              power to cause an affliction against a foe. The
challenge die is the strength of the affliction the
caster is attempting to inflict on the victim. See The
Effects of Magic for this highly variable power.

Enfeeble or Injure

Test: Competence → Expertise + Theurgy

Challenge: d4 (active) or d6 (passive)

Description: Active or passive hit points are reduced
by                              the amount rolled. Failure means the dark magic
fails.

Cause Debility

Test: Competence →
Expertise + Ferocity
Challenge: Special.

Description: This
requires     a
successful divine
intervention (often
at a price), or by
sacrificing 2
character points
worth of ability,

lowering some ability
by               1 die rank to cause an
equivalent disadvantage

suffered by a victim. The victim gets a saving throw
of                          Fortitude → Endurance → Resilience to negate the
spell’s effect long-term but still suffers the effects
for 1 round per level of the caster.

Enervate

Test: Competence → Expertise + Willpower
Challenge: d6 (random threat points) or d8 (fixed
MV drainage of spirit points).

Description: This feat depletes the spirit points of
the                            victim either by the amount rolled or by the MV
of the ability branch.

Unhallow

Test: Competence → Expertise + Willpower

Challenge: d6

Description: The caster tears open a sliver of space
with                               this invocation, the rift functioning as an
invisible conduit to the deepest recesses of some
collective well of evil thoughts and impulses.

Any intelligent creature (other than the caster and
allies) entering into the area affected by the
emanations of evil thoughts and dreams emitted
from the unhallowed conduit must make a saving

throw using Fortitude → Willpower →
Resilience,                      or begin to feel compelled to
harm or betray those closest to them.

Creatures can make the saving throw
every                  minute, but the barrage of
dismaying feelings and incredible
dissonance usually causes great
confusion and fear. The effect
depends on the victim’s highest-
ranked ability, as follows:

Competence: The victim is compelled
to                      lie, verbally abuse, or otherwise
cause mayhem for friends, loved ones,

and allies; anyone visible within the area
of                      effect (radius of 2x Competence →

Expertise MV + Wizard or Theurgy bonus).

Prowess: The victim is suddenly aggressive and
seeks                               to physically harm friends, loved ones, and
allies in the unhallowed area. Those wielding
weapons will attack anyone close to them, but not
any allies of the caster, whose auras will appear too
powerful and overwhelming to consider.

Fortitude: Victims will want to intimidate,
overpower                           (physically or mentally), or by any means
possible drain the mental or physical endurance of
those around them. Mystics are especially dangerous
in the unhallowed ground if failing their saving
throws. Mystics are especially dangerous in the
unhallowed ground if failing their saving throws.

257


EFFECTS OF MAGIC

Shadow of Influence

Category: d8—Occult—Harm, Afflict (Multi-Effect)

Rarity: Secret (held by necromancers)

Challenge: d8 (base); d12 (with Great Competence →
Expertise → Wizardry rank)

Description: This spell creates a dark stream of
shadow                               that stretches out in the form of visible
psychic energy, inflicting harm and disorienting the
target. Threat points of non-physical damage, which
are dodgeable but not parried or blocked, represent
the inflicted harm.

Disorientation: The target suffers a -3 penalty to all
skill                            checks and attack rolls for rounds equal to the
caster's Wizardry focus bonus. During the spell's
maintenance, the caster's other ability tests incur a -
3 penalty.

Intensified Form: Mind Maelstrom

Requirement: Great (20+) Competence → Expertise →
Wizardry rank. Before casting, the necromancer
must announce the intensified form as intended. To
activate, the necromancer must succeed at a d12
challenge die roll, expend 5 Spirit Points, and use a
mastery die. The cost includes 1 Spirit Point per
target beyond the first. The shadow disperses like a
swirling cloud of darkness, impacting all targets
within the caster's Expertise MV, measured in feet.

Each target suffers non-physical potential harm and
must make a Fortitude → Willpower saving throw. On
failure, the caster can implant a suggestion, alter a
memory, or create an illusion lasting up to 10
minutes per target. During the maintenance of these
effects, the caster's other ability tests incur a -4
penalty.

Chapter 10:
Story


o player will be happy to produce
characters who participate in

activities that lack a coherent narrative.
Fighting,                      role-playing, and problem-solving are
essential, but there is no flesh for the skeleton
without some idea of a plot. Adventures are not
intended to push characters into predetermined
outcomes, however. How can the GM avoid
leading players by their noses?

Avoiding this problem is simple: adventure
plot                           hooks need to fit the group’s style and
expectations. PCs need plausible motivations
and goals. Sure, making an interesting
adventure is up to the GM, but players are also
expected to follow story hooks. Otherwise, why
play a fantasy adventure game? The Game
Master does not decide each game session’s
outcome but instead allows fate and player
character decisions to determine outcomes. A
good Game Master ensures his players
experience a sense of danger without the fear of
certain doom and reserves the ability to use or
dump rules whenever necessary.

Story Arcs

Stories generally follow an arc that rises and falls
from                             set-up (background, character objectives),
through a build-up (actions and events as characters
try to achieve something), to success or failure and
then a wrap-up (things are more-or-less resolved).
The story unfolds through collaborative storytelling
and can be determined by participants’ actions,
whether NPC or PC.

Before any objectives have been decided, the GM
should                            suggest that each character has something in
common with the others. For instance, choose one or
more of the concepts below to give players the
reason for their common bond.

• Common allegiance to a patron, noble or
ecclesiastic.

• Compatriots in a network, established adventuring
party,                             or a heroic guild.

• The characters are all blood-related or loyal to the
same state.

• All previously lone adventurers seeking fortune
and                          fame but with a common enemy.

• Met at the tavern and now friends. Easy enough,
although rather uninspired.

Once each player has a common bond in mind,
determining                               their characters’ motivation is easier.
But for many fantasy adventures, you do not have to

259


STORY


have a more complicated motivation than “get
wealth, power, and fame.”

A goal that encourages all characters to pursue a
common quest is important, but remember, they can
get boring if things get too predictable. In addition to
the expectation of player characters being “open to
seeking adventure,” the Game Master should
maintain a range of alternatives to determine
individual character goals.

Individual goals may include clearing one’s name
for                              an uncommitted crime, an urge to explore a
mythical place, seeking revenge on a nemesis, or
thwarting a noble or cult’s evil machinations.

Story Elements

The rising action begins with a strong opening, a plot
hook of some kind. The action includes everything
you would expect; questing, combat, exploration,
role-playing, and problem-solving.

The rising action of a role-playing game session is
a                           narrative in constant flux. With the right story
hook, players will get into the action quickly.

Key information can be discovered during actual
play,                               as revealed through information gathering and
conversations with NPCs.

In any case, the Game Master is wise to limit time
length.                               The structure of fantasy adventures remains
relatively constant, despite the game form’s free
flow, unpredictable nature. The adventurous heroes
complete each milestone, eventually culminating in
a single “story-arc.”

There may be many turning points on the road to
completing the story, or it could be a simple one-
shot with a straightforward mission.

Heroes gain reputation or disrepute, improve their
abilities,                              store up their present conditions, rest, and
reflect on their experiences' impact.

Then, naturally, trouble finds them again. A final
resolution only occurs when players retire their
characters, or all heroes are tragically killed. We all
hope it is the former situation.

Story Hooks

Plot hooks are incidents designed to propel the
characters                              into the plot’s rising action. Action can
consist of a single adventure or several linked
scenarios with myriad objectives and obstacles.

Problem-solving may be any challenging dilemma, a
problematic barrier or terrain, or learning how to
thwart the machinations of a recurring and evasive
villain.

There is no reason for action without a good hook!
Listed                              below are various nutshell ideas to lure the
adventurers into the plot with the promise of
adventure, whether for glory, wealth, or personal
motivations.

Story hooks often involve an NPC, one who entrusts
heroes                            with, pleads with heroes to undertake, or
lures heroes toward various possible objectives. This
goal could be local monsters' extermination,
exploring hazardous locations, questing for
legendary artifacts, or rescuing creatures or people
of significance.

260


Common story hooks

•A mission for the player characters asked for by
their patron.

•A powerful or important NPC sends out a plea
for                          help.

•There is an ally in trouble.

•A dire threat to the realm.

•Some NPC or monster has a grudge or seeks
revenge against the PCs or a person or place
important to them.

•NPCs are hindering the progress of the PCs in
an overarching way so that they cause them to
fail in their overall career as adventurers.

•A mysterious stranger shows up with a mission
for                             the player characters should they choose to
accept.

•A mundane message in the proverbial bottle or
some mystical and mysterious message that can
lead to adventure.

•Rumors and legends with a definite tie-in to
the                              next possible event kicking off an adventure.

•An unexpected attack or ambush against the
player characters for reasons they have yet to
learn about.

•Unjustified accusations put the player
characters                            on the defense and they must clear
their names and discover then defeat the ones
who would frame them.

Locales

When building adventures, it is useful to think of a
handful of key locations and sketch out the function
of each significant encounter in each place. Use the
following lists as a brainstorming aid, rolling
percentile dice if you wish.

Common Scene Locations

•Castle

•Catacombs

•Caves/Cavern (limestone, volcanic)

•City or Town

•Community

•Donjon (keep tower)

The GM will sketch out some plot-driving
contingencies,                           which require resolving several
obstacles before triggering another event. Any story
obstacle, hook, or new prospect for adventure can
incorporate something that sets other story
functions in motion.

Sometimes, a single action is required before
another                           encounter is triggered, but it is impossible to
anticipate all future character actions, so it’s advised
that the GM play a narrative shell game with the
story elements, moving things around as needed.

You may want to create random or even inevitable
encounters                           unbound from planned scenes.

In such cases, only certain actions, including skill
or                           ability use, lead to encounters with NPCs.

Below are some common themes for creating
conflict                         and opportunities to move the plot from
session to session.

261


STORY


Battle

Combat Revenge: A friend or place dear to the hearts
of                                an ally or one of the PCs has been attacked,
murdered, or desecrated, or violated. Such an act
must be avenged. Skills useful to the task include
bluffing (infiltration), disguising oneself (to
infiltration), the abilities of an escape artist, forgery
(infiltration), gathering information, intimidation,
sense motivation.

Rising Evil: An NPC or monster has risen as an
enemy                               and must be subdued or killed. Or, a place
must be cleared of danger or opposition, down to the
last man or beast. Then it must either be occupied,
destroyed, or rebuilt. Skills useful to the task include
prowess and associated specialties, focus in combat,
and tactics.

Clear Locale: some dangerous place (a cave or classic
dungeon) must be cleared of danger or opposition,
down to the last man or beast. Then it must either be
occupied, destroyed, or rebuilt. Skills useful to the
task include anything related to combat and tactics.
Skills and abilities related to combat are always
helpful.

Escape

Escaping some locale could be a prerequisite to doing
anything (often including sleeping). The PCs have
been imprisoned, held hostage or the Locale is
doomed by some looming disaster or cataclysmic
event. But there are guardians at the gates of
freedom, enemies who would see the PCs dead or
wish the populace to remain doomed. The escape
might be required of the PCs alone, or the heroes
could be expected to help the innocent evade harm.

Useful skills: balancing (for escaping from
precarious                             places), disabling devices (for bypassing
traps), disguising oneself, the abilities of an escape
artist, animal handling (for stealing mounts),
hiding, jumping (to freedom!), listening (for
guards), moving silently, opening locks, riding skill,
searching (for keys), sensing motivations of others
(for bribes), sleight of hand (for palming objects),
general survival skills, swimming, tumbling, and
others.

Explore

The PCs must explore, survey, and map a place for
themselves or their patron. Such exploration is
necessary to prevent the party from going astray and
getting lost in places where food and other resources
are scarce.

The place could consist of catacombs, caves, ruins,
mines,                             islands, labyrinths, necropolises, trackless
wilderness, or similar locations. The expedition’s
goal might be to determine whether a viable threat
exists and whether rumors and legends of the place
are accurate.

Useful skills: balancing, climbing, disabling traps,
the                            skills of an escape artist, jumping, listening,
riding, searching, spotting things, general survival
skills, and swimming (most actions falling under
Prowess → Agility, or Competence → Expertise or
Skulduggery).

262


Investigate

Some magical, divine, or psionic lore poses a danger
to                               the heroes, their home, or their allies. The threat,
typically someone who carries such knowledge and
cannot be trusted, must be eliminated. Usually, such
an entity is a sage of evil alignment who possesses
knowledge that he threatens to employ under the
right conditions.

Useful skills: deciphering scripts, forgery, gathering
info,                          sensing motive (will the person possessing the
knowledge use it?), sleight of hand (to steal and
destroy material knowledge), broadly falling under
Competence and Prowess.

Discover

Perhaps there is a place containing a person, thing,
knowledge, or force which must be found and used.
But, alas, its location is unknown.

This place could be anywhere: Hallowed and
unhallowed ground, fountains of youth, the River
Styx, hidden mage towards, lost caves, forgotten
ruins, and unmapped places of yore.

Useful skills: knowledge (history, arcane, ancient
history,                              et cetera), gathering info, travel, evaluation,
hunt, luck, ranging, mental resistance (to withstand
magical emanations or traps), or precision-based
abilities for tricks and stealth.

Spells that discern the truth are helpful.

Espionage

Uncover plots and conspiracies, criminal plans,
enemy                           strategies and tactics, troop dispositions, and
so on. To go incognito is a must to spy on or infiltrate
on the enemy ranks, at least temporarily, whether
required of the adventurers or one of their allies.

Skills useful to the task include bluffing (avoid
detection),                         disguising oneself (avoid detection),
forgery (change identity), sense motivations.

Useful skills: powers of evaluation, one’s
Competence → Perception, general scrutiny,

adeptness with stealth, roguish tricks, and urbane
knowledge.

Seek

The player characters are set on a quest to find a
person,                             place, or thing. Perhaps some powerful
artifacts must be found. It could be something used
to avert disaster or cataclysm or a symbolic item that
has the power to calm social or political strife. Or it
could be one piece of a shattered item that must be
restored.

Neutralize Mysterious Evil

It could be that some magical, divine, or psionic
items                                or artifacts threaten the heroes, their home, or
their allies. This threat must be eliminated.

Useful Skills: Competence-based actions include
appraisal                              (to detect decoys), divination, crafting (to
create decoys), deciphering scripts (to read ancient
treasure maps), disabling devices or traps (or else
get blown up), specific knowledge (any sort relevant
to the item), and searching, the abilities of an escape
artist (when the item itself can entrap), general
arcane or divine knowledge, and spellcraft to identify
magical hazards.

Seek Knowledge

This objective involves hard-won knowledge. It
concerns                        scholarship, so much information or study
will be needed. Knowledge must be obscure or
esoteric, but information about any profession or
craft may be lost. Only the largest number of sages
and experts (NPCs only) will access this knowledge.
Implied here is the exposing of lies and
misinformation.

Useful Skills: Deciphering scripts (the truth
sometimes                                is in old documents), diplomacy (people
who are liked are more apt to find the truth),
disguising oneself (attain truth by infiltration),
forgery (to get into places where truth can be found),
gathering information (the universal failsafe skill),

intimidation, sensing the motivations of others, spot
(for                           visible clues).

Search for Individuals

A known and (as far as is known) living person is
missing                              and must be located. They hold some
important item, fact, or expertise required before the
final goal can be attained.

Useful skills: diplomacy (to win friends of those who
may be protecting their whereabouts), disguising
oneself (to fool those who protect the person’s
whereabouts), forgery (to seem official when
inquiring), gathering info, intimidation (when the
person knows the person’s whereabouts but is
stubborn), sensing the motivations of others, spot (if
the person happens to run by…).

Unravel Mystery

The identity of some mysterious NPC, creature, or
supernatural entity must be discovered. Terrible
events have been associated with this mysterious
figure, a legendary figure, the key to the treasure,
etc.

Useful skills: gathering information, sensing others'
motivations, and the best magic spells for ferreting
out somebody who hides.

Diplomacy Objectives

Adventurers will not only accomplish their goals
with                              sword and spell! In fact, there will be occasions
when diplomacy and negotiation will be their most
effective weapons. Diplomacy objectives requires
that you use your persuasive abilities and knowledge
of cultural practices and customs to achieve your
objectives. It may be necessary to negotiate peace
between warring factions, persuade a recalcitrant
NPC to provide information or aid, or convince a
ruler to alter a harmful policy.

Diplomacy requires finesse and tact, and those
skilled                            in this art will achieve great success. Only
through a profound understanding of the world’s

complexities will you be able to successfully navigate
its                         complexities. The addition of diplomacy to your
arsenal of skills and abilities will give you a new way
to approach challenges in the game, emphasizing the
importance of social skills and communication in
addition to physical and investigative abilities.

In this realm, a silver tongue and a keen
understanding                               of others’ motivations will serve thee
well. Choose thy words with care, adventurer, for
they may prove more potent than weapons!

Negotiate Peace between Two
Warring Kingdoms

Two neighboring kingdoms are on the brink of war,
and                               the player characters have been tasked with
negotiating a peace treaty between them. The
kingdoms have long-standing grievances against
each other, and tensions are high. The player
characters must navigate the delicate political
situation, gain the trust of both sides, and find a way
to broker a lasting peace.

Useful Skills: Diplomacy, bluffing, sense motive,
knowledge of cultural practices and customs,
history, and politics.

Convince a Stubborn Ruler to Change
a                     Harmful Policy

A ruler has implemented a policy that is causing
harm                                 to the people in his or her kingdom, but refuses
to change it. The player characters must find a way to
convince the ruler to alter the policy for the
betterment of the realm’s subjects. However, the
ruler is known for stubbornness and is unlikely to
change his or her mind easily.

Useful Skills: Diplomacy, bluffing, sense motive,
knowledge of cultural practices and customs,
persuasion, and charisma.

Players’ Introduction

Ainerêve, the Eldritch Realms, and Crossroads

AINERÊVE

Ainerêve

The cloud-capp’d towers, the gorgeous palaces,


Ainerêve is a fantasy world, shaped by the dreams of
Earth: it has normal lands and peoples, as well as
mythical monsters, fantastic races, working magic,
and otherworldly influences. It is made up of settled
lands (stable areas) where most adventuring takes
place, and unsettled lands (areas in flux), which are
more dreamlike, and provide the means for
interdimensional jaunts. Some of the lands were
established in the past by folk magically transported
from Earth.

Player characters are assumed to be natives of or
visitors                                to the Eldritch Realms, a group of settled
lands in Ainerêve. To the north is Dalmavand, a
proudly independent kingdom, culturally an
amalgam of Norse and later medieval society, shaped
by Nordic myth. Its hardiest heroes are descendants
of the Varangian guard. Centrally situated is the
Forest of Meath, a place defined by Celtic mythology,
whose native shee clash with Persian peris and
deevs. To the south lies Psarmorum, peopled by a
lost company of Templar Knights and pilgrims
tricked into worshipping a demon. Westerly lies
Maedoen, a kingdom of pre-Roman Celtic/Welsh
culture, but changed under the influence of the shee.

The town of Crossroads is situated in Maedoen, on
the                               edge of the Forest of Meath. It functions as a kind
of neutral city state. It is an active trading center,
and a natural meeting place for travelers, both from
the Eldritch Realms and further afield, since it
contains the Equinox Portals, magical gates to other
realms. It also features the Guardians’ Guild (an
explorers and adventurers group), a Mages’ College,
and many collegial inns and taverns. Player
characters of any kind and background can be easily
introduced to the setting, a perfect springboard for
those in search of adventure.

The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
Yea                         all which it inherit, shall dissolve;
And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,
Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
As dreams are made on, and our little life
Is rounded with a sleep.

— [ The Tempest (IV i) ]

Ainerêve is a dream world, a shadow realm, an
alternative                          dimension. It coexists undetectably with
the Earth that we all know so well. Its essence may be
primordial chaos, raw protomatter left over from the
creation of the universe, or perhaps the aether of the
ancients: the fifth element, breathed by the gods and
forming the soul. Whatever its basis, its substance is
mainly shaped by thought and takes local form from
the beliefs and imaginings of humankind. Ainerêve is
thus something like a phantom Earth — it has lands
and seas, mountains and rivers, sun and moon — but
reality there is unstable, and areas of normality are
set like mosaic pieces in a changeable flux of dream
and caprice.

In general terms, Ainerêve is made up of settled
lands                             and unsettled lands. These terms are in
common use, in one form or another, across the
dream world. Settled lands are stable regions,
internally consistent and relatively static. Physical
phenomena and those things that depend on them
(such as travel) are normal. There can be weird
things in settled lands, things that no person on
Earth ever saw, but even the weird things there are
somewhat predictable, being folk beliefs and so on
conceived of on Earth.

Ainerêve’s primordial protomatter has a receptive
intelligence,                            literally reifying the thoughts and
dreams it responds to. It fills in the gaps from the
Earth it swirls through, so when a forest or herd of
animals is imagined, each tree and beast is real and

268


indistinguishable from its earthly model.
Extraordinary                            creatures are extrapolated from this
basis, so they are mostly real, and for instance, a
shee (one of the fairy folk) can mate with a human.
Sentient beings have free will and, in some cases,
their own souls. In short, things are pretty much like
a fantastic Earth. Walk down the road to the baker,
and he’ll always be there. Houses don’t get infected
with some sap’s random thought of Baba Yaga and
walk away on their owners. It is beliefs, solid and
lasting, that create settled lands. Over time, as a
mythology or religion refuses to fade on Earth, it
creates a place in the infinitely malleable Ainerêve.
That is where settled lands come from.

Unsettled lands are lands unclaimed by any belief,
and                               they are ruled by dreams. Whereas lasting faith
or consistently-held ideas forge a settled land and
stabilize it, the quicksilver dreams of humanity keep
the unsettled lands in constant flux. Far stranger
things happen or live there than in the settled lands,
and they are far more dangerous. A location in the
unsettled lands can be concrete and real in
appearance (even if thematic), dreamlike, or
completely abstract, and may sometimes change
with the ideas of the moment. Love may create a
blushing pink-and-red area with soft curves and
some razor-sharp angles. Cult beliefs might focus on
the cult leader and vague savior figures, perhaps
with the cold, blue and white backdrops of
unswerving dedication.

Proximity in Ainerêve’s Unsettled lands is dictated
largely                             by conceptual nearness. That is, two places
are only as close as the dreams or beliefs that color
and shape those locations. To travel from an
unsettled place based on fear of death to one based
on fear of the dark is a short jaunt — the emotions
are the same, and both are shadowy unknowns.

Going from the idea of a circus, complete with spun
sugar and clowns, to a wealthy fantasy kingdom
requires a longer trip. Worse, in the unsettled lands
you can never be sure if going the same direction
means you’ll get to the same place each time.

Ainerêve’s definition of nearness means that the
settled                             lands, defined largely by a single belief
system, surround themselves with related concepts.
Travel out of a Buddhist settled land, and the
unsettled lands will be more Hindu or Taoist than
Christian or Norse. Still, it usually takes a significant
period of traveling through unsettled lands to reach
a settled land not one’s own. Leaving the Buddhist
region, one is likely to come across pseudo-Buddhist
unsettled ideas first. Buddhist-like religions, ideas of
peace, reincarnation, vegetarianism, and other
Buddhist precepts will abound. Next might come
admixtures of Buddhist and Hindu concepts, and
then near-Hindu beliefs before the traveler finally
reaches a Hindu-flavored settled land.

The change is very gradual. Settled lands exert their
stabilizing influence over a significant area. Leaving
one means that a traveler will experience a slow
change in general wilderness décor as one belief
melds into another, and from the various ideas that
have seeped in over the years. It is only far from any
settled land that a person finds places that change as
he watches and where a misstep can mean a
thousand years of pain. There are not settled lands
for every religion and belief, or Ainerêve would all be
settled lands, with a slow change in nature as one
traveled across it. Instead, the criterion for becoming
a settled land is the sort of imaginative energy that
resonates with the realm.

One can navigate unsettled lands in two ways: in
the                          educated manner, following the chain of
concepts from one settled land to another; and by
conventional (settled land) navigation, which may
function as intended, but usually depends more on
instinct. In the end, both are equally effective — or
ineffective. Skilled travelers of unsettled lands are
very rare, and usually mix the two methods to find
their way in and out more than once.

Beyond conceptual similarity, there is one other
thing                               that can bring two places together in the dream
world. Repeated and shared experience can solidify
parts of the unsettled lands to make a reliable (if not

269


AINERÊVE


necessarily safe) path between two unalike locations.
This                          happens only rarely.

Inhabitants come to Ainerêve from two sources:
Earth                              dreams and beliefs, and Earth itself. The first is
more common, as the imaginations of the Victorian
era conjure figures like Dracula into being, or as the
fears of early American settlers give rise to
nightmarish entities reflective of their own
prejudices and tales. Entire unsettled lands have
been populated this way, though the inhabitants
generally fade over time and disappear unless
reinforced with belief. People from Earth
occasionally travel to the dream world through a
form of unknown magic. Once there, most end up
making their lives there and beginning a new society
in whatever settled land they can find. Usually,
people from Earth only find their way through to
settled lands to which they are close — those based
on beliefs similar to theirs.

The Eldritch Realms

This book concerns itself with a very small section of
Ainerêve. It involves settled lands with enough
concepts in common that they grew together over
long periods of time.

To the north is Dalmavand, a proudly independent
kingdom,                           culturally an amalgam of Norse and later
medieval society, shaped by Nordic myth. Its hardy
heroes are mainly descendents of the Varangian
guard.

Centrally situated is the Forest of Meath, a place
defined                               by Celtic mythology, whose native shee clash
with Persian angels (peris) and demons (deevs). To
the south lies Psarmorum, peopled by a lost
company of Templar Knights and pilgrims tricked
into worshipping a demon in a twisted simulacrum
of Christianity.

Westerly lies Maedoen, a kingdom founded on the
Celtic/Welsh culture that preceded Roman
occupation, but changed forever under the influence
of the powerful shee.

The War of Cultures

Psarmorum is evangelistic and conformist, and their
discovery of the heathen Maedoens on the other side
of the Forest of Meath roused them to another of
their many holy crusades. This one has been going
on intermittently for at least a hundred years, but
it’s hard to be certain. On the Maedoens’ part, they
war for their way of life and their shee brethren.

The Forest of Meath, apparently stuck in the
middle,                         manages to flourish despite soldiers
tromping back and forth through it. The northern
kingdom of Dalmavand is neither powerful nor
populous, but stands out for its fiercely free spirit
and savagery in combat. Its people are a sturdy,
high-hearted race, sound in body and ardent in
spirit, and produce adventurers aplenty.

Cosmology

In Ainerêve, reality is born from the dreams of
Earth’s                          creatures. These inner visions, shaped by
imagination and desire, merge with the ethereal
substance known as Meterea—the plane of
manifestation—to form an alternate reality. Symon
of Dalmavand, often dismissed as mad, proposed
that beings within Meterea progress through stages
of solidification. Emerging first in a liminal, semi-
existent state within the unsettled lands, they
gradually cohere as the collective unconscious of
Earthbound minds lends them definition, until they
pass into more concrete realms of being.

Spirits of the Unsettled Lands

A location in the unsettled lands can be concrete and
real                                in appearance, dreamlike, or completely
abstract, or even change with the ideas of the
moment. Where a location is more abstract or
dreamlike, it is common to encounter spirits called
Inklings. Where a location is more real or thematic, it
is more likely to encounter Extantars, and other
beings of more discernable forms and types.

270


Extantar: When something of more defined form,
purpose,                               and intelligence is imagined by dreaming
humans on Earth, its idea may be elaborated upon,
written in stories, drawn in imaginative books, and
take various forms. These creatures are mortal, but
exist mostly in the unsettled borders of the Meterea.
They typically take the shape of something
humanoid, animal, or mythical creature. Some can
even fly, depending on the dream seed from which it
was born. Gazing upon and examining an Extantar
directly is difficult. They seem to constantly morph
and shift their form in an unsettling way that tricks
the eyes and makes it difficult to pinpoint their exact
position. Extantars are known to be subject to
perceiver's own beliefs about what he or she is
seeing, thereby slightly shifting in appearance, so no
two people see the same thing, though it will be
similar.

Inkling: A shadow of an idea, usually manifesting
only                                 as a sort of will or purpose, sometimes good,
sometimes evil. These spirits are like shreds of
dreams, unformed with only emotions or intent
apparent. They take the form of shades, sometimes
humanoid, sometimes animal-like, their coloration
shades of grey, from nearly white to black; the
darker the shade, the more ill-will or malice is
apparent. They emanate their intent and can harm or
heal if encountered.

Creatures of the Settled Lands

Settled lands are represented by entire mythologies
and                              belief systems that merge within the Meterea, its
constituent dream seeds attracted to each other by
centralizing motifs in their prevailing time and
cultures, the vision of a place concretizing in areas of
the dream world like “reality bubbles,” its borders
defined largely by a single belief system, slowly
dissolving out into unsettled protomatter at its
edges.

Reifient: Any creature native to the Eldritch Realms
whose                            reality solidified into an archetypal being is
classified as a Reifient. Although the first of these
beings may be born of chimeric energy, stepping out
of the dream to walk upon the settled ground, it is
not entirely understood how the various fantastical
species proliferated. Once made manifest in the
Eldritch Realms, such creatures tend to procreate
and multiply as would their near counterparts on
Earth, or by some means dictated by their
unknowing creators’ collective imagination. All
alfar, fay, elves, dwarves, goblinoids, giants, gods,
and dragons alike are classified as Reifients.

Sojourners and Outlanders: Sojourners are spirits of
humans in astral travel, sometimes blown by astral
winds through the Meterea into Ainerêve. Outlanders
are humans of Earth, real by definition, and brought
into Ainerêve through a revorage rift (aka dream
storm). Sometimes this is a single individual, and
other times it is an entire town, but what they have
in common is that where they cross over is generally
dictated by their collective experience, beliefs, and
the reality with which they are familiar.

271


Volitional Demiplanes

The Volitional Demiplanes emerge from the
determination                               of powerful entities, shaped by the
deliberate shaping of Ainerêve's foundational
material into autonomous and distinct realities.
These realms reflect the visions, desires, and

AINERÊVE

Dream Storms; Reveorage Rifts

A dream storm, known estoerically by sages as
Reveorage Rifts, is a particularly vivid dream
experience shared (but not always recalled) by a
group, arising from the collective psyche.

Should this psychic squall encounter a drift of


occasionally the trepidations of their creators, going
beyond simple physical spaces and often displaying
characteristics vastly different from their
geographical surroundings. These domains are
under the control of Reifients—gods, demigods, and
other influential figures, each realm mirroring its
creator's hopes, fears, and dreams.

Accessing these demiplanes varies greatly
depending                                on the intent of their creators. Some may
require mastery of arcane rituals, expertise in
traversing ethereal dimensions, and the strength to
withstand the mental and physical challenges
encountered during such expeditions. Conversely, in
other cases, one might inadvertently find themselves
in a demiplane while meandering through a forest.

The perception and nomenclature of the Volitional
Realms                          differ across cultures, shaped by local
legends and mythologies. In Dalmavand, they are
honored as "Echoes," seen as dwellings of deities.

Maedoen views them as "Sanctuaries," approached
with                                a combination of trepidation and awe as
residences of enigmatic powers. In Psarmorum, they
are referred to as “Sanctums,” erroneously believed
to be dens of demonic entities. Meanwhile, the
Meath forest inhabitants know them as “Fertile
Glens.” Spanning from the lush landscapes of
Meath's Fertile Glens to the daunting urban expanse
of Dys, each embodies a unique reality.

spots’ in the fabric of reality.

— Excerpt from the chapter ‘The Nomological Law of
Manifestation,’ from the Tome of Unreality, written by
the heretic Magister Esprit-Faucon of Psarmorum.

“These realms are a tapestry of an eldritch dream
becoming                             manifest, some law of the universe strangely
reifying the dreams and nightmares of humankind. So, in
my epiphany, I have discovered a dream, a rêve
transmogrified into a nightmare. I hate this revelation
and loathe to share it with the unenlightened. It would
drive most mad to know that we are each the
epiphenomena of a parallel reality, with no essential
selves but that dreamed of in another place and time. It is
a place of hateful dreams, an entire plane I henceforth
call Ainerêve. Maybe some can embrace its chaotic and
chimeric nature, but I cannot fully comprehend the
implications regarding the Outlanders.

The Outlanders, through this intuition, being humans of
Earth, are more real by definition than am I and brought
into Ainerêve through a Revorage Rift, as would a
visiting god. And no, this will not do. There must be a
way to reverse the flow of manifestation, to upend these
laws so that one like myself can create them rather than
the other way around. Through an understanding of
magic, this may one day be achieved.

Take, for example, the commonalities of the humanoid
creatures                                 in these realms. All is explained by the
independent origination of similar biological forms and
functions in the imaginations of humanity. Still, it is
through the common motifs of the myth that we are
made real. One day, we of Ainerêve will turn the tables,
and the people of Earth will become our dreamt-of

realities.”

The Calendar of Ainerêve

The calendar of Ainerêve was devised by a sage of
Crossroads, a man named Symon, currently a
member of Crossroad’s Octocirculi Academy, and a
worshipper of the god Chronos. Symon is one of the
very few scholars in the Eldritch Realms who
recognized that the universe of Ainerêve consists of
homogenous reality “bubbles,” each sphere
reminiscent of the cultures of the people who
collectively dream of them, unlike the Fertile Glens
created by singularly powerful beings who craft their
own realms within extradimensional spaces in the
forest of Meath.

Symon figured that although time does march on,
as                                 on all worlds, it is not fixed around the rotation of
the sun as it is for Earth. So he used Earth’s
Gregorian Calendar as a starting point and changed
the names of the months and days, mixing local
languages and added the suffix “rêv” to the end of
each month, meaning a turn of an Astral Dream
Cycle, which is a full month of the generative dreams
of every living creature on Earth.

A full dream cycle representing the solidifying
power                                 of one month of Earth’s dreamers slowly
altering reality in unsettled lands, its influence
slowing seeping into the edges of settled lands.
Among the scholars in the Eldritch Realms familiar
with Symon's theory of a dream-based reality, few
are convinced of its veracity; however, a handful of
Outlanders, who have survived the passage through a
dream storm from Earth, find such truth in their
newfound, surreal existence.

Regional Descriptions

Having established a solid understanding of the
overall                          structure and milieu of the Eldritch Realms,
we now venture into a closer examination of each
distinct region. These pages offer a thorough
exploration of every area, revealing their distinctive
traits, key personalities, and concealed mysteries.

This in-depth insight enables you to deeply engage

with the world, create compelling stories, and shape
memorable adventures.

Population: Small villages and hamlets, focusing on
specific trades like agriculture or fishing, maintain a
traditional way of life. Moderately sized towns serve
as trading hubs, offering diverse professions and
services. Large cities, populated by merchants,
scholars, and adventurers, provide opportunities for
knowledge, wealth, and intrigue.

Economy: Details the economic framework, key
industries, and unique trade practices of a region.
Provides insight into the prevalent types of
businesses and the overall economic health of the
area.

Local Pantheon: This section explores the religious
and                          spiritual landscape of a region. It includes
descriptions of the major deities worshipped, the
nature of religious practices, and the influence of
these beliefs on the daily life and governance of the
area.

Local Authorities: Who lays down the law? Well, this
is                             where you go to find out.

Important Entities: Whether Game Master-
controlled                        characters or well-known monsters and
organizations, they will be described and given
statistics here if they’re important to the region.

Only the most influential or mighty creatures
deserve                           definition on the grand scale of a nation, so
most end up within a specific location. Also in the
individual character descriptions will be some rough
directions for rivalries, alliances, and how else
things might play out in a game.

Noteworthy Places: This tells you what all pilgrims,
travelers,                          locals, or sightseers recognize about the
place, what’s famous or infamous, and what isn’t
well-known, but still may be important. Great
pyramids and great whorehouses both fall under this
category.

274


Relics and Treasures: Famous bits of loot or
powerful                            artifacts that can be found in the region.
Anything important enough to draw a petty thief’s
eye but too well-guarded for him to steal falls under
this category, as do other interesting prizes.

Vendors and Dealers: Every good adventurer needs
someone who can turn the treasures he or she
“finds” into lovely, lovely cash. These are the good
ones (and sometimes the bad ’uns, too). These can
also serve as “fixers” for some mission-style games.

Guilds and Training: Not every place is large enough
for                        organizations to be present, but when they are,
this is where you find them. Thieves’ guilds, mage’s
guilds, churches, and the like. Also, when a character
wants to find a teacher for some skill or the other,
guilds and individual teachers or independent paths
listed here to fill that need.

Regional Monsters: Here you find a description of
the                              sort of thing your heroes can find to fight in any
given place, along with sample statistics.

Adventure Hooks: This is just about the most
important                             entry in the whole list. Sure, you need to
know what a region looks like and how its
inhabitants act, but you really need some good ideas
for your games. This is where you find them. (There
are also plenty of potential adventure seeds in the
text should you wish to develop them.)

Crossroads

Located near the Forest of Meath in Maedoen’s
Kingdom                                of Croisrath, Crossroads is a haven for
adventurers and mystics. Bustling markets teem
with life, guild halls are filled with tales of bold
deeds, and the renowned college of magic attracts
seekers from across the Eldritch Realms. Here, Alfar
and humans—an uncommon sight in Maedoen—
gather, drawn by the town’s converging ley lines and
the mysterious Equinox Portal at its heart.

At the center of the town stands the imposing
structure                           of the Guardians’ headquarters. This
adventurers’ guild hall, surrounded by lively
marketplaces, is a bulwark against the untamed
dangers lurking in nearby lands and the Forest of
Meath.

Under the spiritual watch of the matriarchal Gan
Creadigeath and the wise rule of High King Gwalter
ap Dagda, Crossroads balances druidic traditions
with regal authority. The influential Black Standard,
an independent mercenary group, is also subtley
involved in the towns’ security and politics, with
many members joining the town guard.

In the heart of the town, Duchess Sibyl, the regent
of                            Croisrath since King Verurteilt’s demise, has
forged strong alliances with the Guardians’ Guild,
the druidic Sisters of Gan Creadigeath, and the
esteemed leaders of the mage College, united in their
sworn duty to safeguard and prosper the region.

Rising majestically from the heart of Crossroads is
the                               mage College, also known as Octocirculi
Academy. This esteemed institution is a visual
marvel, its four towering spires and spiraling turrets
piercing the skyline like magical innovation. Within
the hallowed halls of the academy, individuals from
all walks of life converge, united by their pursuit of
magical knowledge and understanding that
transcends linguistic barriers.

275


AINERÊVE


Also near the central part Crossroads lies the
Equinox                          Gatehouse, harboring the infamous Equinox
Portal – a gateway to realms beyond.

Population: Moderate. The town is an active trading
center,                              with a surplus of farm produce and timber
and a constant flow of mundane and exotic goods
and those trade in them. Many people pass through
Crossroads, including some especially strange
denizens who arrive via the guarded Equinox Portals,
which open to a dimensional rift twice a year. Those
who travel through unsettled lands are drawn to
Equinox Portals, which sit on the nexus of ley lines.
This brings in to Crossroads travelers from different
cultures, as well as otherworldly places in Ainerêve.

Economy: Strange travelers from Meath Forest,
wayfarers                            once lost in unsettled lands but stumbling
upon this town, and merchants from both Maedeon
and Psarmorum create an economy of barter and

trade in Crossroads, especially in exotic teas and
coffees.                               A small number of other-realm adventurers
(and monsters) filter through to Maedoen and
Psarmorum, making Crossroads the perfect place to
find black market items, magic items, and weapons
and armor uncommon to local realms. It’s a great
place to hire a ranger guide or typical mercenaries.
Information is also a big commodity in Crossroads.
The Guardians’ Guild and Mages’ College are the
prime sources.

Local Pantheon: Crossroads recognizes and tolerates
the                           followers of many pantheons, accepting all
deities so long as they do not represent forces
opposed to the towns very existence, although most
of its temples and shrines are dedicated to the array
of deities belonging to the pantheon of the Tuatha
De, the Celtic Mythos holding greatest sway among
the majority of the towns denizens.

Local Authorities: Duchess Sibyl oversees Crossroads
and                              pays homage to Gwalter ap Dagda, the King of
Maedoen who sits on the throne of the city of
Grimsete. She knows the town is particularly
hazardous, situated as it is on the nexus of major ley
lines, and thus prone to infiltration or outright
attack by powerful monsters. The town guard is paid
handsomely and helps keep dangerous beings from
entering the town or raiding farms and is sometimes
supplemented by unusual members of the
Guardians’ Guild.

The town is considered a “neutral zone,” as
enforced                               by the Guardian’s Guild, and that fact has
attracted adventurers from myriad backgrounds,
including Bertran Forthwind, who famously set up
the most esteemed magic school in the realms, the
Octocirculi Academy. This was in part to help Virgil,
the guild leader, and the Duchess protect the two
kingdoms of Maedoen from the dangers of the
Equinox Portals of Ainerêve.

The guard is led by a goblinoid half-orc named
Throk:                             he was captured outside town, exposed as a
smuggler leading black-market criminals into

276


Crossroads, and was to be executed by the Duchess.
The                           Duchess is fervent about controlling any
criminal element in Crossroads, especially regarding
goblinoid creatures, whom she personally dislikes.

But an elf named Nathal, one of the Gan
Creadigeath’s                         emissaries from the Seelie court
stepped in and saved Throk’s life on the condition
that he serve the town forever. Nathal claimed that
the half-orc’s human side had some shee blood–as
do all Maedoens–and, therefore, Throk was not a
complete abomination.

Throk. Occupation: Captain, town guard (warrior).
Half-orc                           male. Competence d6 → Perception d10.
Prowess d12 → Melee d12 (Threat +2) + Precision d6.
Fortitude d8 → Endurance d12 + Strength d10 +
Willpower d8. SP (Spirit Points): 14, Active DP: 24,
Passive DP: 30. Armor: d8 (chain).

Notes: Throk is a half-orc, an unfortunate fact few
have                             failed to recognize due to his exceptionally
homely appearance. His origin was one of violence
and tragedy. His human mother was called “Mère
Aufahm” by her mercenary hirelings and “The
Whore of the Orcs” by the goblinoid tribes. She was
no victim but a perpetrator, a blackheart who forced
the women of her remote town to copulate with the
local Orc chieftain, only to sell the unnaturally
strong babies as warrior slaves to nomad tribes in
the far reaches of Psarmorum. “Throk” was named
after the sound made when she’d smack his large,
crooked nose. He was an exception to her business
model, her own child raised solely to protect her.

But her luck ran out, as did Throk’s, when Lucalla
tribe                           members raided and slaughtered her and all of
her half-orc slaves. Throk fled into Meath forest,
met many strange allies, and emerged a year later
near Crossroads, where he suddenly appeared to help
the elf Nathal escape a band of marauding harpies
near the forest border.

Equipment: Great Axe of Shattering (a roll above 8
bypasses armor if attack exceeds defender’s chosen
Active Defense. Opponent’s armor must make an
item saving throw versus double its die rank (i.e.,

leather 2d6, Chain 2d8, etc.) or be reduced one die-
rank                             until repaired. Also, defender’s shields, if used,
have a 2% chance of shattering per threat point
inflicted with Throk’s Axe (including Common
magical shields). He also owns several spears and a
sledgehammer.

Treasure: Throk carries beef jerky, a few coins, and
his                           weapons. Now and then, he may have a severed
head in his bag as a temporary souvenir. He’s not
known to care much for treasure.

Duchess Sibyl. Occupation: Duchess of Crossroads (&
Queen Regent of Croisrath). Human female.

Competence d10 → Expertise d8 + Perception d6.
Prowess d4 → Precision d6. Fortitude d6 →
Willpower d10. SP (Spirit Points): 20, Active DP: 4,
Passive DP: 6. Armor: None (+2 DR azure cloak,
works like a shield).

Notes: Duchess Sibyl is tall and regal, usually seen
wearing                            beautiful flowing sapphire gowns and
valuable but understated jewelry (one item of which,
a garnet ring, is the focus for her spells, adding +2 to
her ability tests). The daughter of a Psarmorum
prince, she was promised in marriage to King
Verurteilt, the petty king of the region of Croisrath, a
lesser kingdom of Maedoen, as a peace offering. The
Duchess understood the value of good alliances and
relished the power the marriage afforded her,
despite the common knowledge that Verurteilt was a
fool. She confidently expected Verurteilt to undo
himself sooner or later, which he gratifyingly did
when he slipped from atop a turret when drunk and
fell to his death. She has a keen mind and is a good
judge of character, so she was adept at navigating the
political strife attendant on stepping into her late
husband’s role.

Her friendship with Virgil of the Guardian’s Guild
and                             Bertran Forthwind of the mage College was
fortuitous, allowing them to shield her from rivals,
and secure the land the Duke had once claimed,
building it into Crossroads as it is today. The Duchess
afforded herself a unique amount of power and
prestige among the lords of Maedoen. She was also
appointed a proxy of the Eldritch man to protect the
borderlands of Meath and therefore granted the aid
of Nathal, a Seelie Emissary of the Gan Creadigeath.

277


AINERÊVE


Equipment: Dagger of the Moon (20 energy points
(EP))                               can activate the spells Full Body Illusion and
Illusory Attack, like a wand. Magical azure cloak (–2
DR as a shield, before Active Defense). The Staff of
the Unsettled (3d10, 24 EP. This is a Jaunt Staff (see
entry on Virgil), capable of Teleport Self and attuned
to the Crossroads Equinox Gate. Guardian Sigil
Brooch (Legendary, persistent magic, Boon, adds 10
hit points temporarily to Active DP, usuable once per
day for 10 minutes, the points usable only in the
event of a magic attack. The brooch is attuned to
Duchess Sibyl only).

Treasure: The Duchess possesses all of the riches of
her station and also the heirlooms of her late
husband. The value of cash assets is easily two
“hoards” (see treasure table in GM Guide): 2000–
20,000 coins worth.

Nathal. Occupation: Gan Creadigeath Seelie
emissary,                       adventurer. Elf male. Competence d10 →
Expertise d10 (Spellcraft +5) + Perception d8.

Prowess d8 → Precision d10 (Ranged Threat +5) +
Melee d10. Fortitude d4 → Willpower d12. SP (Spirit
Points): 22, Active DP: 18, Passive DP: 4. Armor:
None (+2 DR azure cloak, works like a shield).

Signature Spells: Chameleon, Illusory Attack. Can
create                                a Demon Trap, or Ward of Minor Protection.

Notes: Nathal is a high elf and one of the Shee
nobility,                                 a son of Titania, Queen of the Fair Folk of
Meath. He is kind-hearted and soft-spoken but of
steely resolve when facing evil and injustice. He is
tall, with platinum hair (matching his scintillant
armor), fair skin, and golden eyes, earning him the
appellation “The White Lion.” He represents the
Seelie Court as a liaison between the shee and the
druids in Crossroads and presides over the annual
Council of Renewal between the humans of Maedoen
and the Tuatha Dé Danann.

Equipment: Sword of Fae +4 harm, bypassing
mundane                           shields and armor on any attack roll
totaling over 13. Magic Breast-plate and elven chain
armor 2d8. Cloak of Invisibility (20 energy points).

Treasure: Carries only a few coins (20–200) with
him;                             has a hoard, 1000–10,000 coins value in gems
and “arboreal” art in his domicile.

The council is a tradition that began with the pact
made by the earliest human with the natural
creatures of the land, which established the Dagda

Priesthood. Although Nathal does not quarrel with
Mali,                            leader of the Gan Creadigeath, he deeply
questions the legitimacy of the matriarchal order.
His mother Titania was a party to the treachery that
destroyed the older, male, druidical order of
Cernunnos.

He was also there centuries ago when his father
decreed                             that the Cernunnos bloodline be honored by
making the son of Mab, daughter of moon goddess
Arianrhod, the first Eldritch Man (which has proved
to be a curse to those who hold the “honor”). Nathal
knows that Mab has since joined the Unseelie Courts
planning retaliation against her father, Oberon.

Despite the shee’s tumultuous history, Nathal is not
a                           proponent of their leaving Maedoen for another
fabled realm deemed their homeland, and shuns
pilgrimages to Adweth Hill. He thinks the foretold
exodus is a misreading of legend and that the people
can make the realms their heaven with enough
vision. In this, Nathal finds an ally in Mother Mali
because she wants to integrate the human culture
and shee.

Noteworthy Places

The Duchess’s mansion is constructed of marble,
brick,                                and timber. On the same site is the shrine of
Dagda, housing that priesthood. There also is a small
Temple of Astra, whose shrine serves as a neutral
zone for merchant travelers from Psarmorum.
(Astra, one of the aspects of their god Sol Invictus, is
called the savior by many in Psarmorum. Some
believe he soon will return to the realm and end the
war, heralding an age of peace.) Sol’s followers are
protected by Virgil’s Guardians’ Guild, who prevent
the apprehension of travelers deemed unwelcome by
the Nation of Maedoen. They have saved many from
murder by the Dagda Priesthood.

278


The Mage College (Octocirculi
Academy)

The Octocirculi Academy in Crossroads is Maedeon's
foremost                            institution for magical education and the
only official school of wizardry. The campus features
eight towers, each representing a distinct magical
discipline: Arcanum, Elementalism, Thaumaturgy,
Sorcery, Druidry, Hieraticism, Mysticism, and
Oneiromancy. Led by Archmage Bertran Forthwind,
the Academy plays a crucial role in both magical
research and political affairs. The annual Council of
Renewal brings together the two Kings of Maedeon
to reaffirm alliances, showcases mages' discoveries,
and fosters cultural exchanges. The Eldritch Man's
recitations, offering insights into ancient magic, are
a highlight of the event.

Bertran Forthwind. Occupation: Chancellor,
Octocirculi                         Academy. Human male. Competence d12

→ Adroitness d8 + Expertise d10 (Spellcraft +5) +
Perception d8. Prowess d4 → Agility d8 + Melee d6 +
Precision d6. Fortitude d6 → Willpower d10 (Vitality

+5). SP (Spirit Points): 22, Active DP: 18, Passive DP:

6. Armor: none. Level: 5, Mastery D12. Signature
Foci:                           Wand (Warp Strike: d12+d10+5). Magic Path:
Thaumaturgy.

Notes: Despite his adventurous spirit, Bertrand
Forthwind                               is a man of unwavering convictions. Of
average height and build, he presents himself
unassumingly, often clad in a simple tunic and cloak.
His unassuming attire belies his mastery of
thaumaturgy, as he carries several gnarled wooden
wands tucked into his belt, along with an athamé, a
ceremonial dagger. Bertrand, along with the
academy's eight designated archmage mentors, is
committed to harnessing the societal benefits of
thaumaturgy.

Equipment: Wand of Binding, 3d10 incapacitation,
maintainable.                           The want is crafted to incapacitate
enemies non-lethally. When activated, it binds the
target with ethereal bonds, immobilizing them for a
duration determined by Bertran's Mastery Die (D12).
The wand works within a moderate range and can
affect one target at a time. Targets may attempt to
break free each round, requiring a difficult Fortitude
or Willpower test. Wand of Psionics, adds 20 to all

279

Sorcery threat points (200 energy points), single
target                               or area effect. Wrhydri bracers (magical
leather), +1 to passive armor, and +6 DR once/round
vs. any spell-based threat points. Also carries an
athamé (more often used as a focus item).

Treasure: Bertrand keeps only a few items on his
person,                               like his wands, and little to no coinage.
However, the college is a practical museum of
strange and dangerous artifacts, the value of which
is indeterminable. A thief may loot the college’s
treasury and come away with several hundred
thousand coinage worth in wealth, with 100% chance
of 3d12 magic items in the haul (many cursed), but
it’s unlikely any but the most legendary footpads
would ever make it out alive.

The Eight, as the academy staff calls themselves,
secretly                            wish to convince Gwalter Ap Dagda to allow
Nerthach, the Eldritch Man, to seek asylum within
their walls as a blatant challenge to the ancient pact
that holds the realms in thrall to the Seelie Court.

Bertrand sees as a golden age the days when the
druids                             were the powerful masters of nature rather
than the mere proxies of the fairies of Meath forest.
He’d wish for the peaceful return of the order of
Cernunnos, not to destroy the Gan Creadigeath, but
to integrate and reform, but he understands that
peace is an unrealistic expectation should those
circumstances arise.

The academy accepts ten students a year, male or
female,                                  of any intelligent (and even innately
magical) race, so long as they show latent talent and
are not associated with the Gan Creadigeath, whose
power Bertrand believes weakens and stifles society.
The Gan Creadigeath, in turn, underestimate his
influence and vision for a more advanced and
decidedly arcane civilization. Travelers will note that
the college grounds are testament to his vision, with
lamps lit by magic and details like a small sourceless
stream running moat-like around the academy,
softly aglow at night. The beautiful, circular meeting
table in the main meeting hall can display an
explorable map of the known realms, like a
mahogany scrying surface. Even the college’s sewage
system and aqueducts are magically aflow. Bertrand

happily entertains townsfolk each year with
fireworks                           displays, and throws feasts for nobility

elemental fire. The academy recognizes gods and
goddesses but does not encourage worship so much
as have a healthy respect for their power.

The Equinox Portal of Crossroads

The Equinox Portal is housed inside a large stone
archway                              near the centrally located adventurers' guild
house and is heavily guarded. Delegates from the
kingdom, warriors, and mages hold a ceremony
twice yearly to herald the gate's opening during the
spring and autumnal equinoxes. Nobody knows who
or what will come through the gate at those times.

The Equinox Portal of Crossroads is one of many
scattered                          throughout the Eldritch Realms, all of
which serve as magical conduits to distant places,
and some believe they are all connected by ley lines.
Mages, equipped with appropriate knowledge and
skills, can use these portals for travel to different
locations within the Eldritch Realms. The portal
shifts from one realm to another, the places
predictable only by augury.

The exact place follows an unpredictable pattern, as
dictated by humans’ dreams, hopes, and fears on
both sides of the gate. For those attempting to walk
through the gate, the destination is always
somewhere on the outskirts of settled lands in
Ainerêve; it is inherently dangerous. Some travelers
pass through the rift and travel to the realm of their
choice: perhaps in an induced trance or with the aid
of an artifact that allows quick passage through
unsettled lands. (e.g. jaunt staves.)

Vendors and Dealers, Guilds and
Training

There are many places to seek rest, entertainment,
or                                 to procure equipment and goods in Crossroads.
Travelers will find several alehouses, a general store,
an apothecary, blacksmith, horse trader, falconer,
gambling house, fishmonger, and wagoners. Other,
more prominent places include:

• The Guardian's Guild and Martial Training Hall, an
imposing structure blending Gothic and
Romanesque styles. Its robust stone façade, adorned
with stained glass and legendary statues, symbolizes
the Guild's strength and the rich tapestry of tales
within.

• Guardian’s Bank; an actual bank — owned
collectively                            by adventurers and explorers and
overseen by Virgil.

• The Boatwright (offering rides along the river that
runs                               next to the town).

• The Octocirculi bookshop, stocked with tomes,
manuals, and scrolls from exotic places.

• The Coffee House (for the intelligentsia of
Crossroads                          and Maedoen, sanctioned by both the
Gan Creadigeath and Shee Lords’ visiting sages).

• Mage College (with its striking spiral towers).

• Lapidary (needed when gem-laden adventurers hit
town).

The Guardian’s Guild

The Guardian's Guild, a pivotal hub for mercenaries,
seekers,                            and explorers within the Eldritch Realms, is
at the core of the bustling town of Crossroads. As a
renowned organization teeming with seasoned
explorers, daring swashbucklers, and bold
adventurers, it offers an easy starting point for

characters pursuing camaraderie and adventure.
Situated                         near the Equinox Portals, the Guild is a
gateway to many opportunities and challenges,
drawing in those who thirst for adventure and
beckoning them toward the untold mysteries and
adventures that lie beyond.

The Guild is a common ground for characters from
diverse backgrounds and fantastical species; its
diverse objectives and membership foster most
character motivations and backstories. Characters
can thus pursue quests and treasures or engage in
battles that align with their personal and guild-
driven goals. The Guild's resources further support
this endeavor, providing immediate assets for
characters' adventures, thereby streamlining the
campaign setup.

Integrating new players into an ongoing campaign
centered                             around the Guardian's Guild is
straightforward. Newcomers can be woven into the
story as recent recruits or inducted through the
unfolding narrative organically.

The Guild Hall

The Guardian's Guild building is a striking example
of                              Gothic and Romanesque architecture. Its imposing
stone façade features sturdy buttresses and arched
windows, giving it an air of fortitude and elegance.

The building seamlessly integrates with the
surrounding                        landscape, with ivy and other climbing
plants partially covering its walls.

The Guild is surrounded by well-maintained
grounds,                            featuring a combination of open courtyards
for gatherings and shaded areas for more private
discussions. The main entrance is a large, arched
wooden door reinforced with iron bands and adorned
with carvings depicting scenes of heroic deeds and
mythical creatures.

Large, stained-glass windows are a prominent
feature,                      casting colorful light on the stone paths
leading to the entrance. These windows depict
various historical events and legendary battles.

The roof is steep and tiled, with several towers
rising                            above the main structure. These towers serve
various purposes, from lookout points to private
meeting rooms for high-ranking members of the

practicality and ethical adaptability, recognizing the
unpredictable nature of an adventurer's life. Guild
leaders understand the need for flexibility in
extenuating circumstances, allowing adventurers to
uphold the Guild's principles while navigating the
challenges they encounter on their missions and
quests. The Guild's broad and malleable principles
are designed to accommodate various individual
character interpretations and playing styles,
empowering players to chart their unique path
within the Guild's framework.

282


Whether adventurers opt for deep integration into
the                             Guild's core activities or prefer a more peripheral
association, players, including the Game Master,
choose the level of involvement that aligns with their
preferences.

I. Guild Loyalty and
Representation

• Guild Identity: Represent the Guild with pride.
Individualism is valued, but actions while wearing
the insignia reflect on the entire Guild.

• Discretion in Using the Insignia: Understand the
influence of the Guild's insignia. It symbolizes
capability, not necessarily altruism.

II. Conduct in Pursuit of
Interests

• Pursue Diverse Goals: Whether
treasure              hunting, monster slaying,
or heroism, pursue your goals
determinedly. The Guild
accommodates myraid ambitions.

• Pragmatic Engagement: Engage
pragmatically.                      Unnecessary cruelty is
discouraged, but "collateral damage" can occur.

III. Responsibility and
Independence

• Guild's Oversight: Members are held accountable
for                          actions undermining the Guild's power,
reputation, or key alliances, especially with
Maedoen's crown.

• Repercussions for Missteps: Actions jeopardizing
relations                          with key allies or misrepresenting our role
face severe repercussions, including expulsion.

• Engaging with External Parties: Conduct outside
activities                          without attracting negative attention to the
Guild. Independence is respected, but not at the cost
of collective reputation.

• Duty to Report: Report actions risking critical
damage                           to the Guild's reputation or alliances.
Collective interests are prioritized over individual
transgressions.

• Guild's Right to Intervene: In severe misconduct
cases,                           the Guild may intervene directly.

IV. Contribution and Support

• Supporting the Guild: Fulfill tithe obligations to
contribute to the Guild’s prosperity.

• Tithe Requirement: Members tithe 10% of annual
earnings                                 to support services and foster camaraderie.

• Enforcing the Tithe: Annual auditing
ensures              compliance. Penalties for

non-compliance may include
suspension or expulsion.

Leniency is possible in
extenuating      circumstances.

• Share Knowledge Wisely:
Share         experiences and
knowledge, but be mindful of

sensitive information.

V. Conflict and
Dispute Resolution

• Self-Regulation: Members are expected to resolve
disputes                       independently.

• Dueling and Challenges: Dueling is a recognized
means                               of settling disputes, conducted honorably and
without disrepute to the Guild.

• Condemned Actions: Actions like treason or
espionage against the Guild are expressly
condemned.

• Avoiding Factionalism: Avoid creating factions
within                             the Guild. Differing opinions are natural, but
division for personal gain is frowned upon.

• Respect for Guild Leadership: Respect for Guild
Leadership: While dissent is part of the Guild's

283

dynamic, actions undermining leaders are naturally
frowned                              upon

VI. Operational Integrity

• Avoid Undermining the Guild: Undertake missions
with                              a balance of boldness and discretion. Avoid
actions that weaken the Guild's position.

• Review and Disciplinary Committee: Handles
misconduct cases, ranging from warnings to
expulsion.

• Mitigating Potential Harm:The Guild may
undertake                           reparative missions or public disavowal to
mitigate damage caused by members.

VII. Membership

• Insignia Tattoo or Insignia: Full members receive a
mystical tattoo of the Guardian's Insignia.

• Loss or Removal of the Tattoo: Re-issuance
process                              for lost tattoos due to injury. Unauthorized
removal triggers an alert.

• Detection of Imposters: Imposters risk detection.
The                         "Discern Soul" spell reveals imposters when
cast by authentic members.

The principles emphasize balancing individual
autonomy                           and collective responsibility, shaping the
Guild's identity and operational ethos.

Founder of the Guardian’s Guild

The Guardians are led by Virgil, an eccentric older
man                              who set up the Guild to protect outcast warriors
and renegade mages.

Virgil. Occupation: Adept; Leader of the Guardian’s
Guild.                           Human male. Competence d12 → Adroitness
(Cleverness +2) + Expertise d12 (Wizardry +5) +
Perception d8. Prowess d10 → Agility d10 + Melee d10

+ Precision d6. Fortitude d10 → Willpower d12. SP
(Spirit                            Points): 24, Active DP: 30, Passive DP: 10.
Armor: d8+4 (Wrhydri Chain). Level: 5, Mastery: d12.
Signature Weapon: Rapier of Banishment — Medium

— Slashing; 2d10+2.

Equipment: Virgil’s Jaunt Staff. Like most of the
traveling                             staffs Virgil created, the Jaunt Staff is
attuned along ley lines in Maedoen and Psarmorum,
allowing him unhindered travel via the gates in
either realm. The staff is an artifact capable of
manipulating Ainereve’s protomatter within the
unsettled lands, amplifying Virgil’s “dream vision”
during travel, actually reshaping the terrain, leading
him to where he wants to go like a divining rod, as
long as the place is adequately named and described.
The jaunt staff has a crystal ball affixed to its top,
which amplifies Virgil’s imaginal journey vision,
helping him find his way. It is also imbued with the
following spell-like powers: Dispel Effect
(Thaumaturgy), Flux Bolt, Teleport Object, Teleport
Self.

Rapier of Banishment. Medium — Slashing. Striking
a                          supernatural creature with this legendary rapier
triggers an opposed roll of 3d10 versus the creature’s
Saving Throw, or the summoner’s Competence →
Expertise → Wizardry branch, whichever is more
relevant. Failing this save means the creature is
instantly banished. It’s a permanent item with its
banishment properties always on (therefore, no
energy points required). Wrhydri Chain (d8+4): non-
magical potential harm cannot bypass this armor.

Virgil also possesses many other magic items,
including                            many potions of healing and protection
and perhaps some means of prolonging life since he
is now very old indeed.

Treasure: Virgil owns a bank, and his net worth
amounts                              to that of a dragon’s hoard (something the
Duchess is fond of reminding him): 10,000–60,000
coins value and 50% chance of 2d12 magic items.

Although the guild is independent in outlook, over
the                              years, the group developed into a major force for
weal globally; the amassed skills, expertise, and
daring of its members having proved particularly
effective when dealing with menacing monsters and
dark magic. The guild takes a percent fee on
treasures gained by its members in return for
providing access to information, training,
employment, and other services. Virgil pays a tax to
the Duchess and respects the high king of Maedoen,
but looks the other way when its members’ activities
might be at odds with the king’s interests.

284


The Guardians’ Guild also maintains a labyrinth of
concealed pathways through the Forest of Meath and
beyond, offering alternatives to the Safe Road for
those daring to venture through less charted
territories. These routes are under the vigilant watch
of the Guild, ensuring they remain as secure as
possible.

The Guild's outposts, strategically placed along ley
lines,                               serve as hubs for organizing expeditions and
managing the balance between the known and the
wilds. In exceptional circumstances, where the paths
through the unsettled lands become treacherous, the
Guild may authorize the use of a Jaunt Staff. These
rare artifacts, while not common gear, provide
guidance through the most unpredictable regions,
allowing for expeditions that might otherwise be
impossible. However, it is the bravery and expertise
of the Guild's members that stand as the true
bulwark against the dangers encroaching upon the
kingdoms of Enwys and Croisrath.

The Guild Hall has large books of places and
creatures                         cataloged: some identified by travelers
passing through the Equinox Portal; other
information revealed by captured unfriendly beings
(there is a Guild prison for interrogation of such).

Members may have the Guild’s information for a
price — a very steep price for non-members.

Crossroads Adventure Hooks

Roll up, Roll Up! Canguistine the Magnificent is a
showman beyond compare. All he needs is a show.
Since Crossroads is known to have many monsters,
he has come here to capture a menagerie of beasts
that he will take on tour to the seven corners of the
cosmos — or so he says. Canguistine is slender, dark,
energetic, charismatic and just a little sly: his magic
is showy but of little substance, as is his personality.
He has money and will pay for the capture of rare
creatures — he might go so far as to use the network
of ley lines and the Equinox Portal to summon a
particularly spectacular monster, with the intention
of capturing it of course. He just needs a hand… and
guess who he wants to recruit to give it to him?

285

Nathal’s Fear: The elven emissary has received word
that                                 a dark mirror realm — one that is a duplicate of
Crossroads but a mirror image, where that which is
evil has become good and vice versa, is drawing
metaphorically near to the Equinox gateways and
that an overlap will occur. The duchess has dismissed
his concerns since the sage Signoret has detected no
such dangers, and neither have any of her seers. But
Nathal has not been misled, and a shadow is about to
fall over Crossroads that will see some of its
residents intertwined with their mirror images — a
Crossroads where the Guardian Guild oppresses
rather than protects and evil entities are welcomed
through the portals…

Maedoen

Description: Maedoen is a land of mountains, rivers,
and                             rocky beaches washed by cold waves. It is like old
Wales, and its nature and legends resemble Welsh
and Celtic mythology.

Maedoen occupies the southern part of a peninsula
shaped                              like Earth’s Britain (with Dalmavand
occupying the northern area where Scotland would
be). To the west lies the cold ocean and several large
islands. To the north and south lie great seas,
difficult to cross, separating the Maedoens from the
dangerous unsettled lands. Directly in the center of
the nation’s eastern border lies a hundred-mile
stretch of land that ties the peninsula to the Forest of
Meath and through that to Psarmorum, with which
Maedoen wars. Traveling on the seas around the
forest almost always brings one to unsettled lands
that resemble, but are not, Psarmorum. Meath
cannot be entered on that side; it does not even
appear to connect to the continent, though explorers
believe that it somehow must.

History: Ages ago, what would become Maedoen was
an                             island of warring kings, and the shee who lived
there played mischievously with the inhabitants
instead of looking out for them. At some point, the
sea to the east became fecund, and trees grew out
from the water and floated there atop it. Their seeds
planted more trees, and the trees grew outward from


AINERÊVE


the sea over centuries until they touched Maedoen on
the east and the far land on the west, making the sea
unnavigable. Exploring it, the people of that ancient
land found the sea-forest as stable as any that grew
on the land and more fertile for vegetation and
magic, and soon they forgot its origin and knew it
only as the strange forest.

An unknown period later, the first Knight Templar
emerged                               from the forest, and the war between
Psarmorum and Maedoen began shortly after that. It
has lasted centuries. In addition, great horned
demon-shee attack from the west regularly and with
great ferocity. Their ships sail the waves preceded by
long, iron horns under the waterline, and their great
drums roll with their rowing after they drop sails for
an assault. They have immense strength and
endurance, and if they can capture rather than kill,
they do. These ship-borne monsters are the most
regular threat to the Maedoens from the sea.

Maedoen has two leaders, one spiritual and one
temporal; the Eldritch Man and Gwalter ap Dagda.
The Eldritch Man is the nation’s official spiritual

leader. He is the sole male member of the druidic Gan
Creadigeath and their chosen representative to the
shee creatures of Meath and Maedoen and the gods.
Some believe the Eldritch Man lives forever, but he is
replaced periodically by a properly-trained young
man. His name is never known, and he spends nearly
all his time among the fay creatures and legendary
gods of Maedoen. Though the Eldritch Man is
supposed to guide the spiritual life of Maedoen, he is
seldom there; the Gan Creadigeath guide the people
in his name.

Ruling over Maedoen in the realm of economy, law,
and                               war is currently Gwalter ap Dagda. The title “ap
Dagda,” meaning “son of the Dagda,” is appended to
every king’s name, and it indicates that the great
blessing and goodwill of the Dagda is with the king.
By the nation’s most ancient law, the product of a
forgotten pact with the land’s natural creatures, the
Maedoen high king is half-shee. Once a king is
crowned and married, he travels with a small retinue
of Gan Creadigeath to find the ‘proper’ shee, as
determined by the king and his advisors. The shee,
once found, spends one night with the queen and
disappears, leaving only a guest gift behind. The next
king is born later. It is rare, but if the king’s heir is
unfit to rule (or simply declared so), the king must
repeat the process (usually with a new wife). Human
blood is always stronger than shee, so the
miscegenation must continue each generation.

Gwalter is a strong king. His sway over Maedoen is
undeniable, and the Gan Creadigeath sorely misses
the great influence they wielded during his father’s
reign, Maddox ap Dagda (Maedoens ignore the
surrogate shee). Gwalter has the strength of arms
and will to lead men well. The Maedoens respect
him, and his position’s strength makes it difficult for
the Gan Creadigeath to refuse his requests of them.

Local Pantheon: The pantheon of Maedoen is
primarily                                an admixture of Celtic and Welsh
mythologies, with the Dagda and Math ap Mathonwy
as the principal deities. The Dagda, the chief deity,
embodies life, death, agriculture, and druidry,

286


wielding powerful artifacts. Math ap Mathonwy is
the                              god of wizardry, encouraging knowledge and
skill. Cernunnos, the Horned God of Nature,
represents untamed nature and druidic traditions.
His story involves a tragic love for Arianrhod and
betrayal by Mab and Arianrhod. Other significant
figures include Arawn, the god of death and justice,
and Brigit, the goddess of life and fertility.

Population: Sparse. Maedoen has a substantial
population,                           enough to guard it against the
depredations of troublesome shee and the
implacable forces of Psarmorum, but they live spread
out. When Maedoens congregate in larger groups,
they never number more than what Psarmorum
would consider a “town.”

Economy: Maedoen is an agrarian society, but all
men                               and many women of age are capable enough
with weapons to defend themselves. At a pinch, the
Maedoens can rise up in arms to defend their homes.
Most of the nation’s economy is internal, involving
trading grains and other foods for woven cloth, iron
tools, and services.

It’s notable that, while the Maedoens do mine and
refine iron ore, they carefully never use iron shaped
while cold. Cold-wrought iron has properties that
make it dangerous to the nation’s shee allies.

Denizens of the faerie realm are also averse to hot-
forged                               iron and steel for this reason, though it does
them no special harm. Since many a poet calls steel
“cold iron,” perhaps this contributed to the
confusion, but it would be unpolitic of Maedoens to
carry steel weapons commonly in any event. As a
result, most of the nation’s tools that require great
sharpness or hardness — mostly for tools of war —
are made of bronze. Because bronze is harder to
come by than simple iron, the uncomplicated folk of
Maedoen still use ordinary wrought iron to make
their knives and simple tools. The ‘cold-wrought
iron’ weaponry is of course only available via black-
market suppliers and by paying massively exorbitant
prices and often is unauthentic. Only kings can or

must spend the effort and money to distribute all-
bronze weapons and tools to their subjects.

Of course, not all fairy folk are friendly; when one
foresees encountering a troublesome shee, there is
little stigma in carrying a knife of cold iron for
security, although the other shee one might meet
with may not agree.

Externally, Maedoen trades to some extent with the
shee. The Gan Creadigeath, led by the Eldritch Man,
takes on this difficult task because the shee require
strange and hard-to-acquire goods or services. In
exchange, Maedoen receives long-lasting spells and
glamor, enchanted objects, and advice. Some
individuals choose to barter for shee goods and
blessings without the protection of the Gan
Credigeath. Only the clever succeed.

There is little trade with Dalmavand, since the two
nations produce similar goods. Some brave
merchants manage to trade reliably with
Psarmorum, more often via Dalmavandish
intermediaries. They regularly bring back weapons
of excellent steel and foreign arts and craftwork;
from Maedoen, they take local woodwork and things
of fay make. The best make a great living, but they
are few. One of the secrets that none have been able
to bring back from Psarmorum is making good steel.
Over the last two hundred years, many have tried,
but without a single success.

Most Maedoens who think about it believe that the
smiths of Psarmorum must be supremely protective
of their crafts, or the close-mouthed government is
skilled at killing those who acquire that knowledge
for Maedoen. In truth, it is the fay of the Forest of
Meath, and the shee of Maedoen, who are to blame.
They stop those who would carry the process to
Maedoen; the forest fay do it to spite them, the allied
shee of Maedoen do it because they prefer bronze. To
the shee, bronze is a soothing alloy.

Local Authorities

Gwalter ap Dagda has authority over Maedoen in
secular matters, and the Gan Creadigeath, led by
Mother Mali, directs the Maedoens in the spiritual

AINERÊVE

the creatures of Hell. While avoiding direct
involvement                            with Sol’s corrupted High Priests, the
Guardians aid and protect Psarmorum’s warriors
against Satan’s legions. Psarmorum crusaders are
protected in the town of Crossroads and guaranteed


aspects of life. Tradition separates Maedoen into two

distinct regions, each called kingdoms, each with its
own                               ruler. Gwalter ap Dagda ruled only one region,
Enwys, directly; in the other region, named
Croisrath, there was a lesser ruler (without the “ap
Dagda” title), named King Verurteilt, who ruled in
the Dagda’s name and who was succeeded by his wife
as queen regent, the Duchess Sibyl of Crossroads.

Each king has the right to call upon the men and
women                                of his kingdom for war, and they
occasionally war with each other, but Gwalter has the
right to command each warrior of Maedoen
individually and so can end wars when necessary.

Important Entities

The Guardians’ Guild

The Guardians’ Guild is an association of
swashbucklers                               and explorers. Members are usually
independent adventurers and treasure hunters, often
viewed as mischief-makers outside of their nerve
center, the town of Crossroads. Sworn members have
access to superior equipment and training and a far-
reaching network of potential allies across Maedoen
and Psarmorum. In return, the Guardians tithe a part
of their earnings back to the Guild’s leadership,
whose mission is to gather treasure and knowledge
to eradicate evil.

The Guild is charged with preventing the evils of
the                             forest, unsettled lands, or equinox gates from
entering their realm of Croisrath and especially with
stopping threats from crossing over into the
Kingdom of Enwys, where Gwalter ap Dagda, high
king of Maedoen, sits upon the throne of Grimsete.

But despite that charge and in full knowledge of the
war between Maedoen and Psarmorum, the guild
often partners with the State of Psarmorum against

asylum so long as they do not raise a sword against
any                        Maedoen native.

The Black Standard

Eons ago, the nation of Maedoen (then a fractious
and                             warring land known by a hundred different
names) became the chosen victim of an unknown
force. Armies of terrible fiends swarmed out of the
oceans on all sides onto the peninsula. Though
vaguely human in shape, these monsters were
always pale white and malformed in numerous ways
that marked their ranks or types. The shee named
them the cythraul, and the shee were afraid.

Their first ferocious assault took the people of the
land                               by surprise. The cythraul scythed through rank
after rank of each petty king’s armsmen, using
weapons, claws and mind-rending spells. Worse,
they also took prisoners. Men and women taken by
the devil creatures could be heard for miles,
screaming, begging, pleading, and making less
recognizable sounds until they stopped. Children
stolen fared worse. Early in the onslaught, the
warlords’ fortresses would open their gates to what
appeared to be small bands of children who claimed
to be refugees escaping death. Blood and terror soon
taught those who survived otherwise, and the child-
things dissembled less and ravened more as the war
wore on.

Despite the horrifying tales carried from the sea by
rivers of refugees, the hundred kings of early
Maedoen did not put aside their personal feuds.

Perhaps the refugees were not convincing, or the
kings                              had no ears for words that didn’t please them.
Who can know? But the land’s many lords paid little
heed to the cythraul sweeping in from the shores,
until much later when the whole of the north (now
Dalmavand) was overrun.

288


Without walls to shield them from the hell
Maedoen                                was becoming, the people could not ignore
the threat. Ruled by kings who would do nothing, the
people decided to defend themselves. The first to
raise a banner was an old farmer who had once
served as an armsman. His banner was black and
plain because it was the only large and sturdy cloth
he owned, but the word that soon spread was of black
against the cythraul’s white faces, and plain against
the creatures’ multifarious bodies. The black banner
and unnamed farmer drew a surprisingly large army
unaffiliated with kings. Men, women, and sometimes
children volunteered, and all were accepted. Most
rulers denounced the force as unlawful, and many
would have set their personal armies against it if
their soldiers had not refused or even defected to
follow the black banner themselves.

This was the turning point. Members of the Black
Standard,                                 as it came to be known, blunted the
spearhead of the invading fiends. Though they rarely
stood up to the cythraul in direct battle, they delayed
or deflected many attacks so that they fell upon
evacuated villages or well-defended fortresses. They
did not end the war — that happened when a group
of young women made a pact with the land’s shee,
planting the seed that would become Maedoen — but
they prolonged it until it could be ended.

In the earliest years after the war, a score or more
of                              the then-kings tried to outlaw the “dangerous
rabble.” They did not remain kings for long. And as
the hundreds of kings dwindled to ten, the Black
Standard forced the kings to accept their existence.
The kings swore that they and their successors, for
all time, would let the Black Standard cross their
lands freely, so long as the Black Standard did not
march against them.

None of the kings swore to give the Black Standard
a                             home. The roughshod army didn’t ask, because
they knew no home would be granted. An army not
under one’s control is a frightening thing to have
around, and armies consume much and produce
nothing (more like locusts than people, oftentimes).

289

As the threat dwindled, so did the army. Many of
the                             soldiers had family waiting, or farms and
livestock and old friends to see again, and so
departed. But some of the Black Standard kept
marching from one kingdom to the next, watching
and ready for threats that the kings would ignore.
And they found them. The core of the Black Standard
army that remains can call willing farmers and the
like to it when the need arises. Maybe there’s
something magical about the Black Standard; maybe
the spirit of the farmer who first decided to fight
walks with them as a rallying spirit, but whatever the
reason, shepherds and green boys all fight better
when they march under its banner.

Although one hundred kingdoms had coalesced
into                              two, Enwys and Croisrath, both regions were
ultimately ruled over by one king, Gwalter ap Dagda
of Enwys, with queen regent Sibyl ruling over
Crossroads.

The Black Standard is still unaffiliated with any
king                                 or lord. This has made most kings in recent
history more than a little nervous. They still do not
like it. Gwalter ap Dagda, in particular, considers the
existence of the Back Standard a slight on his ability
as the ruler and protector of Maedoen. He also sees it
as a black mark on the records of all kings who
preceded him, both because they could not rid
themselves of the Black Standard and because they
needed it.

Gwalter ap Dagda and Fergus the Black do not get
along;                             though Fergus keeps his nose out of politics,
as he believes the Black Standard should, Gwalter is
more than eager to find some way or reason to
disband the man’s army and absorb its soldiers into
his own armsmen. Fergus is a friend of the
Guardians’ Guild, and in fact, guild members march
with him, but he is not himself a member. His
allegiance is to his own.

The Black Standard is small right now. Fergus the
Black                               leads a band of barely more than five hundred,
small enough that none of the provincial rulers of
Maedoen worry about him. Only Gwalter ap Dagda


AINERÊVE


has concerns, and Fergus pays the great king little
mind.                           Centuries and centuries of tradition stand
between Gwalter and Fergus clashing unless one
were to directly attack the other’s men. Fergus would
never be so stupid as to start such an altercation,
even if he had the slightest inclination, which he
doesn’t.

Fergus knows that the Black Standard is
undermanned                               and could stand against very few
important threats but is not worried about this. He
had reasons to let the Black Standard’s ranks
diminish. First, a farmer away from home needs
someone to farm for him — he consumes but does
not produce. By dismissing soldiers, Fergus allowed
more food and goods to be produced. Second, a
soldier needs to eat. Since the Black Standard is
forbidden to settle in any kingdom, it is always on
the move (if not always quickly), and a moving army
quickly drains resources. A smaller company puts
significantly less strain on the villages it passes
through. Third and last, a smaller Black Standard
puts the rulers at ease, making it easier for the
company to scout out dangers as Fergus likes and
otherwise get along without difficulty.

Gathering extra soldiers only as required is part of
Fergus the Black’s strategy. The men of the many
companies he disbanded when he was elected to the
command are now farming, fishing, or smithing, but
they still know how to soldier. And Fergus has
recruited more farmers and farmers’ sons, who have
promised, some eagerly, to come if called. He can
send out twenty fast riders within ten minutes and
have a sizeable and suitable army marching to meet
him as quickly as any king could gather his troops.

Fergus doesn’t know what he might encounter, but
he’s ready. He hopes.

Still, the commander sometimes worries that he
may                          discover a tremendous threat to the kingdom
that will devastate the Black Standard before he can
gather its full strength.

Fergus the Black. Occupation: Commander of the
Black Standard. Human male. Competence d6 → 

Adroitness d6 + Expertise d10 + Perception d4.
Prowess                               d12 → Precision d12 + Melee d12. Fortitude
d12 → Endurance d12. SP (Spirit Points): 6, Active DP:
24, Passive DP: 24. Armor: d12+2 special and Shield
d6 (see below).

Equipment: Fergus the Black wields a massive
oversized                          greatsword (Pionós an Bháis, meaning
death sentence). The weapon is so large it requires a
Fortitude → Strength roll over 2 simply to lift it, and
a roll of 4 or better every round to wield it (although
Fergus need not roll). The sword adds +5 threat
points. Its size means damage can be carried over
from a primary target if additional targets are in the
path of the swing, stopping only when all threat
points are used up or there are no more targets in
range! He carries a round, magic shield (d6 with
active defense) that shines with a deep, dark hue,
nearly black as night. His ebony armor is padded
with heavy fur that offers a layer of protection even
in the gaps normal in armor. The heavy padding and
thick armor convey astounding protection from
physical and elemental harm (d12+2 vs. both regular
attacks and elemental attacks penetrating active
defense). Fergus rides astride his warhorse Eccher,
whose barding matches its rider’s armor.

Treasure: Fergus has access to thousands in coins
and                             gems, but much of it is used to pay for the
army’s needs. He usually carries 200–2000 worth in
valuables, with a 30% chance of 4 magic items
beyond those mentioned above.

Notes: Fergus the Black has access to many weapons
as                             leader of a powerful army but prefers large swords
and maces. He has no spells or other powers but
relies on his great physical strength and military
genius.

The Gan Creadigeath

The Gan Creadigeath is a matriarchal order of druids,
based                             out of the fortress temple of Cartrefol Cyfain,
who act as intermediaries between the humans and
shee of the forest of Meath with pacts forged
hundreds of years ago.

The only male associated with the order is
Nerthach,                                the Eldritch Man, whose role is one of
ambassador and symbolic of the treaties between
humans and creatures of faerie. The Gan Creadigeath

290


commands most aspects of Maedoens’ spiritual lives.
All                             women but for the Eldritch Man, they tell the
gods’ stories, soothe the fay when necessary, and
read the omens in chicken entrails and the flights of
birds. It is the Gan Creadigeath who say when the
gods have blessed the planting, and when it is
fortunate to remove tons of copper and tin from the
mountains that bear them. Their influence is
ubiquitous in Maedoen.

A member of the Gan Creadigeath is usually called a
druid, or “sister Gan Creadigeath.” The wisest
woman in the order, decided by various tests, is
addressed as “mother” and guides the Gan
Creadigeath.

Sisters and mothers travel the length of Maedoen
annually                              to find new members. They visit each town
or village, even ones no more significant than a pair
of hovels by a spring, and examine all children
between the ages of four and nine. Those they find
acceptable, they claim for the Gan Creadigeath, often
to the dismay of their parents. A daughter lost to the
druids is one that cannot plant, weave, clean, or
marry to bind families.

A child the Gan Creadigeath wants looks fair —
somewhat pretty, if not of startling beauty. The child
is smart and insightful. Finally, the child has active
shee blood. The first two criteria test aspects related
to fairy ancestry, but a small magical examination
reveals if the third criterion is met. Many Maedoens
have some blood of the fay, having lived so close to
them for so long, but it often doesn’t express itself. A
child only needs a little active glamor in her blood to
be eligible, but it must be there or the girl cannot
treat with the shee on Maedoen’s behalf.

While such criteria are not shared with anyone
outside                               the order, some parents guess the first two.
They try to dirty up their girls when they know the
sisters are coming (which they rarely do), but do not
often go so far as to knock out teeth or bruise them.
They instruct them not to answer a druid’s questions
(asked privately) or to answer poorly, but the Gan
Creadigeath know how to tease real answers out of

291

children. After being chosen, a girl travels to the
Cartrefol                               gan Cyfain, where she receives her
education in what it means to serve the Maedoen and
the shee to keep both healthy and happy. The length
of education depends on the individual, but it is
typically between three and seven years. The order
does accept children as young as four, but their
training changes even the fastest students into
reserved, mysterious sisters by the time it is
complete. Even seven-year-old druids speak well
and with wisdom.

Cartrefol gan Cyfain

Often just called Cartrefol Cyfain, this low fortress
consists                            entirely of sloping earthworks covered with
grass and flowers, with thick, thorny bushes as
crenellations and massive trees serving as towers
and strong points. It is home to the Gan Creadigeath.
Resting in Maedoen’s east, it is near the spiritually
strong south and the mystical Forest of Meath. The
latter is most important, as the shee who live there
are less friendly toward Maedoens; they are not
bound by the ties between Maedoen and its native
creatures. From Cartrefol Cyfain, the sisters Gan
Creadigeath can present a unified front to the more
dangerous shee.

The natural-seeming fortress also serves as the
home                               and path for all girls and young women
training to become full members of the order. Until
they are ready to journey with a full-fledged sister,
they remain here and study the secret runes,
tongues, and spells of the Gan Creadigeath. Though
it is pleasing to the eye, Cartrefol Cyfain is a very
defensible position, especially when guarded by the
sisters and any allies they are able to call to their aid.

History proved the fortress’s strength over seventy
years                             ago, when Evan ap Dagda called all the armies
of Maedoen down on it in an effort to bend the Gan
Creadigeath to his will. When his siege was broken,
so was his rule, and it took three decades before the
ruler of Maedoen had regained the power that Evan
ap Dagda had lost. Druids outside of Maedoen often


AINERÊVE


have other regional names and titles that apply,
depending                           on whom addresses them or where they
grew up.

Mali, Mother of Gan Creadigeath

Mali. Occupation: Druid. Human female. Competence
d12 → Adroitness d8 + Expertise d10 (Spellcraft +5) +
Perception d8. Prowess d4 → Agility d6 + Melee d6 +
Precision d6. Fortitude d6 → Willpower d12. SP
(Spirit Points): 24, Active DP: 16 Passive DP: 6 (see
below). Armor: d6 (magic cloak).

Equipment: Mali uses a gnarled, magical, yew-wood
quarterstaff in battle. She can use the staff’s power
to fire a bolt of primordial energy for 3d12 harm,
manifesting as any of the five elements. It also
grants 10 points of DP. The staff is a permanent
magic item with 120 energy points. She also wears a
magic cloak given to her by the fay that adds 50
points to her Passive DP and acts as d6 armor.

Treasure: $500 on person, $1,000,000 in domicile at
Cartrefol Cyfain.

Notes: Mali is the current “Mother” of the Gan
Creadigeath,                           guiding them with a firm hand. She was
a rare prodigy, chosen by the traveling sisters at age
four and completing her training in Cartrefol Cyfain
by age seven. By the time she had completed her tour
of Maedoen, she had already allied with a dozen shee
and earned the respect of many of her sisters. Mali’s
ambition as the Mother is to achieve greater
integration between the human and shee
populations of Maedoen.

She believes that with their fundamental
cooperation,                               she could guide the nation to greater
wisdom. The unique perspectives of the shee would
inspire the more mundane inhabitants, while the
baser natures of the human Maedoens would ground
the shee in reality, teaching them to use their
fantastic skills for everyone’s spiritual gain.

Under Mother Mali’s direction, the druids of the
Gan                         Creadigeath have been making entreaties to the
shee courts. Although she considered involving
Gwalter ap Dagda, she correctly believes that he
would resent her intrusion into the realm of the

people’s everyday welfare. She knows many
Maedoens                              would not properly understand her goal,
which is why she is currently dealing mostly with the
shee. Mali is confident that if she can forge an
agreement with the shee of Maedoen and entice
them to intermingle with the human population, the
humans will not resist, or not for long.

Despite her ambitious vision, Mali does not neglect
her                              other duties. Sisters continue to travel Maedoen
in the long-established and complex patterns that
keep their arrival times unpredictable. They find and
bring new sisters to the Gan Creadigeath’s
stronghold, where the Mother and other sisters teach
them.

Mali directs many emissaries yearly to the various
shee                             courts in pursuit of common needs: subtle
spells recast, new wisdom revealed, exchanges of
goods, and secret aid given to various ailing towns
and villages. To her most trusted sisters, she assigns
the crucial task of carefully watching and herding the
Eldritch Man, ensuring he remains suitable for his
mission among the fairy folk. This task is vital, as
losing him would jeopardize their favor with the shee
and derail Mali’s greater plans.

However, Mali is acutely aware of the darker
undercurrents                          within her order. The Gan
Creadigeath's ascension was born from treachery
and bloodshed, orchestrated by Arianrhod and Mab,
and some within the order still harbor resentment
and misanthropic tendencies. Mali must constantly
balance her progressive vision with the lingering
shadows of the past, ensuring that the Gan
Creadigeath remains a force for good while
navigating the complexities of their history.

Even among the Shee and Gan Creadighe,
Nerthach—the                            Eldritch Man—remains a mystery.
He personifies the universe’s essence, possessing
immense power that could alter reality itself. Linked
to both natural and mystical realms, he draws upon
fundamental energies, channeling ancient magic and
profound knowledge. Yet, he is unaware of the full
scope of his abilities—a power that, once awakened,
might lead to creation or destruction.

Nerthach’s deep connection to Cernunnos, the
ancient                              god of the wild, ties him to forces beyond the
Gan Creadighe’s comprehension. As an embodiment
of untamed nature and life’s endless cycles,
Cernunnos mirrors Nerthach’s universal essence.

This bond enables him to surpass the confines of the
Eldritch Realms, aligning with the core truths of
existence.

Additionally, Nerthach is linked to the Meterea, the
fundamental force behind both creation and
destruction, serving as a channel for the raw
energies that shape the universe. Within him, order

293

and chaos intertwine, illustrating his capacity for
benevolence or devastation. His existence represents
a fragile equilibrium that could be disrupted, causing
consequences felt across the realms.

The most insightful among the Shee—Brigit,
Arianrhod,                            Mab, and King Gwalter—are aware of
Nerthach’s true power. They conceal this knowledge,
dreading the turmoil that revelation might bring.

Recognizing that his abilities could be exploited to
unsettle                                the world, figures like Symon and Magister-
Espirit also keep this secret, understanding the risks
of such power in the wrong hands.

The implications of Nerthach’s awakening are
enormous.                                His anger over past manipulations could
unleash chaotic forces and dark magic, altering the
landscape and endangering countless lives. The
delicate harmony between the Shee and humans
might collapse, igniting a war that engulfs the
realms. If he rejects his destiny, it could fracture the
Gan Creadighe, leading to unforeseen outcomes.

Yet, an alternative path exists. Guided wisely,
Nerthach                              could use his power for good—mending
the divide between the Shee and humans, restoring
balance, and revitalizing the land itself. His journey
depends on those around him, with the Game Master
steering his awakening, should it occur. The choices
and challenges faced by the players will significantly
influence whether Nerthach becomes a source of
destruction or a beacon of hope, ultimately shaping
the fate of the Eldritch Realms.

Mali, a perceptive member of the Gan Creadighe,
senses                             that Nerthach is more than he appears. Her
instincts hint at his connection to something
predating the order itself. While she doesn’t fully
grasp his ties to Cernunnos (and the Meterea), she
notices the signs. Her guidance could be crucial as
Nerthach begins to realize the extent of his abilities.

Nerthach’s links to Cernunnos and the Meterea
underscore                           the interaction between order and
wildness, the familiar and the unknown. Despite his
involvement with these cosmic forces, his true
strength lies in this fundamental bond, illustrating

Noteworthy Places

An ancient land, Maedoen has many places known
across                              the nation.

Anluan Sanctuary: Near the southern edge of the
Elden                           Heights or by Lac Miroir, known for peace and
healing

Banríonau: The Regency of Banríonau is a land of
Celtic                               and Nordic influences, forged by the
convergence of those cultures, across a diverse
landscape of majestic mountains, founded by a
visionary leader from Dalmavand and established
with the blessing of King Gwalter, now led by the
wise and strong regent Lady Brynhildr Járncridhe,
who carries on her father's legacy, guiding the realm
with reverence for the Tuatha Dé Danann and the
harmonious fusion of Celtic and Norse heritage,
where the proud and independent people are known
for their exceptional craftsmanship and vibrant
bardic tradition.

Bru Na Bard Bridge: In central Maedoen, a legendary
bridge                         echoing the history and songs of the realm.

Coilltean Fánaí: West of Kaariloft in northwestern
Maedoen,                          stands defiant - a verdant barrier against
the encroaching shadows that linger along the
foreboding Dragonlord Mountains. This mystic
realm where the arcane energies of the feywild bleed
into the mortal world is protected by the satyr
guardian Muirecán.

Dunvalder: In northern Maedoen, renowned for its
skilled craftsmanship, thriving on trade routes.

Eochaid’s Hearth: Potentially in Banríonau Nau or
Dunvalder, a famous inn.

Fortress Draugrheim: In the northeastern reaches of
Maedoen, this fortress guards a crucial crossroads,
standing firm against encroaching threats.

Glenndanach: In southwestern Maedoen, a city of
wisdom influenced by Psarmorum’s scholars and
elemental knowledge.

Kaariloft: Kaariloft, located in the northwest of
Maedoen,                                is a town with a rich yet troubled history.
Once, humans, dwarves, and elves collaborated here,
bringing prosperity through the renowned Soul
Forge, powered by croslamite crystals extracted from
nearby Coille Creige. This era ended when Frode and
his Quasidead cultists, followers of Nigma, destroyed
the town in their obsession with immortality. Over
decades, Kaariloft was rebuilt, largely due to the
efforts of the heroes Sage and Atril. However, the
town’s past lingers; Nigma’s followers remain,
unsettling its peace. Today, Kaariloft stands as a
symbol of resilience, attracting scholars and
adventurers intrigued by its history and the
remnants of its magic.

Olafort: This squat, sprawling fortress lies several
miles                              from the effective border between Maedoen
and the Forest of Meath. It is less than two hundred
years old, a rare thing in the old land of Maedoen.
Olafort is the easternmost defensive construction for
the country, built and manned by the unrescinded
order of an earlier king. The soldiers there are ever
watchful for invasion from Psarmorum (and, less so,
for the incursion of Meath’s shee), against which
they are the first line of defense.

So far, the fort has fallen twice, but each time it has
held                                 off the Templar Knights until reinforcements
could push them back through the forest. Olafort has
enough financial and political support from Gwalter
ap Dagda that its commander has actually managed
successful raids through Meath into Psarmorum. The
smaller size of the Maedoen raiding parties lets them
avoid the similar encampment on the Psarmorum
side.

Sechdraic Valley: This valley distinguishes itself
from                              the majority of Maedoen's temperate, wooded
areas with its undulating hills and pronounced
geothermal activity. The valley's erratic behavior

294


causes ground quakes and landscape alterations,
where                            geysers erupt, projecting clouds of steam into
the sky. Warm, steaming waterfalls cascade over the
hillsides. Legends speak of dragons sleeping beneath
the earth, purported to be the source of the heat. At
times, the valley resonates with the faint sound of
ancient chanting.

Within this valley lies the Sanctuary of Cernunnos,
a                             unique Volitional Demiplane in Maedoen. It is a
hidden oasis of greenery, created by Eochaid, a
demi-god and devoted son of Cernunnos. Eochaid's
realm is a lush and mysterious land teeming with
rare wildlife. His fury over Cernunnos's banishment

has given rise to fiery geothermal activity outside the
sanctuary, fueling rumors of legendary dragons.

Eochaid, born from the union of the wild god and a
mortal woman, shared a unique bond with nature
and harnessed ancestral magic to reshape the land.
His world was shattered by the banishment of his
father through the machinations of Mab, Titania,
and Arinhod. In response, Eochaid established a
lasting tribute to Cernunnos, carving a sanctuary in
the heart of the Sechdraic Valley as a refuge for the
surviving druids.

The Sisters Gan Creadigeath, followers of Brigit and
The Morrigan, view Eochaid and his realm with
caution, concerned that Cernunnos's return would
disrupt their established order and lessen their
influence. Yet, Eochaid's power is linked to the
Sanctuary, affording him immense control but also
binding him to it. The Sanctuary's existence hinges
on Eochaid's continued presence and willpower. His
departure could lead to its destabilization or
vulnerability to external threats. Recognizing the
importance of his connection to the Sanctuary,
Eochaid is aware that leaving it could jeopardize all
that he has built and safeguarded.

Yr Gwethva: Also called the White Graves; these are
the                             three highest mountains in Maedoen, quite near
each other in the peninsula’s southeast. The circular
valley they create between them is one of the

traditional burial grounds of the Maedoen kings. By
this                              point in the nation’s history, over three hundred
different sons of the Dagda are buried there. Each
one has its own burial mound of two to five
chambers, containing the body lying in state,
treasured possessions, and occasionally favored pets.
In some cases, minor shee watch over a tomb to
protect it, or to attract robbers to it out of mischief.

The hidden fortress of Annwn is somewhere within
the                           White Graves, guarding the threshold of
Neogrange, home of the Tuatha de Danann.

Adventure Hooks

There are many quests to be had in Maedoen; just
look                               at ancient Welsh legends for inspiration. But
here are a few ideas.

Escaping Providence: The Eldritch Man has
disappeared,                           and all of the Gan Creadigeath are
searching for him. Why has he left, and where is he
going?

The Eldritch Man has figured out that he’s more of
a                             prisoner than anything else, a toy for the shee, and
he’s decided not to take it any longer. En route from
one shee glen to another fairy court, he stepped off
the path and disappeared into Maedoen. The spells
and secrets he learned over his years in the many
shee courts now serve to keep him hidden. If nobody
finds him, the shee will break off with Maedoen, the
king will lose the Dagda’s blessing, and Maedoen will
descend into chaos. With Psarmorum waiting like
jackals, that can’t be allowed. The players’
characters are the ones who find the Eldritch Man,
whether they were seeking him or not. Stuck
between his misery and refusal to go back (willingly,
at least) and the great potential harm for the entire
nation, the heroes have some thinking to do. Do they
return him to the Gan Creadigeath and the shee, help
him escape, or go about forging a new pact with the
shee that keeps Maedoen together?

Or maybe the Eldritch Man’s disappearance is an
inspired bit of foreign sabotage. When their spies

295


AINERÊVE


figure out that it is the Eldritch Man upon whom
Maedoen’s                            treaty with its native shee depends,
Psarmorum attempts to destroy its enemies from
within. A small squad of stealthy commandos enter
Maedoen and track down the Eldritch Man, then
kidnap him. It is up to the heroes to rescue him
before the Knights Templar escape with him behind
their battle lines, or before the shee decide the pact is
completely broken.

For a situation with more ambiguity, the men from
Psarmorum did not kidnap him. They pulled the wool
from his eyes, helping him see that he’s more of a
prisoner than a diplomat. Now, they’re helping him
escape, and he is their willing ward. Can the heroes
return the Eldritch Man when he does not want to
go?

Missing Soldiers: A small unit of Gwalter ap Dagda’s
soldiers,                               about fifty strong, has disappeared
completely. They left one guardpost but never
reported to the next while traveling through a lesser
king’s kingdom. Gwalter is not one to suffer such an
affront, and if the disappearance isn’t resolved
before he hears of it, the great king is likely to ruin
anyone he considers responsible. What’s more, the
Black Standard passed through the same area around
the same time, and Gwalter would love an
opportunity to blame them and have them disbanded
permanently. Either the local king or Fergus want to
get to bottom of the disappearance, and the players’
characters are there to help. The simplest option is
that they encountered a band of monsters or
unfriendly shee, which was the end of that. The
heroes either need to prove it somehow, or find and
rescue any surviving unit members for eyewitnesses.

More complicated, the soldiers deserted. As a unit,
they                            decided to flee the military and try to disappear.
When they passed through the territory of a king
Gwalter doesn’t trust and the Black Standard came
by, they saw an opportunity and took it. Letting the
politics of the situation cover their tracks, they got
out of there as quickly as possible. Heroes can track
them by asking the right questions in nearby

villages, where a suspicious number of men may
have                               come through to pick up supplies, or by finding
a hillside shepherd who saw the soldiers disperse. Or
the soldiers may have deserted to join the Black
Standard. Knowing that Gwalter would be furious but
unable to turn away men who want to serve, Fergus
requests the heroes’ help to confuse the issue and
perhaps direct suspicion onto the lesser king.

Return of the Druids: Not all druids of Cernunnos
were                            destroyed by Arianrhod’s treachery (see
Equinox Gates). Many perished in the unsettled
wastes beyond space and time, but the strongest
survived, and became heirophants with powers and
perspectives far exceeding those of mortal men. At
some convenient equinox, these patriarchs of the
ancient order will exit the Equinox Gates in style,
wreathed in power, and fully apprised of current
affairs by Cernunnos. Their most powerful members,
currently unable to leave the They can, amongst
other things, snuff out any spell used by a mortal
with a simple opposed roll (vs 1d12).

They could completely overturn the current order,
but                                do not wish to damage Maedoen overmuch. They
can still cause as much turmoil and NPC
consternation as the GM desires. Most likely they
will seek their natural allies, Gwalter ap Dagda, the
Guardians Guild, and the Eldritch Man (who is of the
blood of Cernunnos), and gradually try to return
spiritual life and mankind to what they were. Their
attitudes towards the “silly little girls” of the Gan
Creadigeath and suchlike are very old-fashioned.

They do not trust females, and will definitely wish
to                             train more male human druids — perhaps such
PCs could be their harbingers, trainees of
Cernunnos’ emissaries in Meath. The heroes could
aid them, oppose them, try to broker a compromise
between parties, or take advantage of the ferment
they cause in some way.

296


Grimsete

Description: Grimsete is Maedoen’s only city. It is
also                             home to the king, Gwalter ap Dagda, and serves
as the nation’s capital. It is here that Gwalter holds
court, houses his close family and advisors, and
garrisons his personal armsmen. From the walls of
Grimsete Castle, Gwalter’s edicts guide all
Maedoens, especially in the war against Psarmorum
that he inherited from his father, his father before
him, and so on back two hundred years.

The people of Grimsete are used to war. Ancient
kings                           built the castle, in times forgotten, to help
guard the coast against coastal raids, and it serves
that purpose still.

The people of Grimsete are used to war. Ancient
kings                               built the castle, in times forgotten, as a secure
central redoubt to house forces against coastal raids,
and it serves that purpose still. Homing pigeons
carry warnings from coastal watchtowers to the
castle, and troops are deployed where needed, via
swift horses on good roads. The horned demons have
not stopped raiding, so the soldiers of Grimsete have
not stopped fighting them. But in the period since,
nearly twenty thousand Maedoens have come to live
in the city, once ramshackle but now strong and
stone, outside the castle. The city has its own wall,
and even more live outside it, tending the many
hundreds of acres of planted crops and livestock.

Local Pantheon: The people of Grimsete primarily
worship                              the Dagda, the chief deity of Maedoen, who
embodies life, death, agriculture, and druidry. The
Dagda is often associated with oak trees, symbols of
strength, wisdom, and endurance, and his followers
believe that the oak tree is a conduit to the
Otherworld. A small order of druids, known as the
Order of the Sacred Oak, resides within Grimsete
Castle, serving as advisors and spiritual guides to
King Gwalter ap Dagda. Unlike the old, banished
order of Cernunnos, this order includes both men
and women and is tolerated by the Gan Creadigeath.
Their rituals and ceremonies focus on maintaining

the king's connection to the Dagda's lineage, the
land, and the Shee, ensuring the prosperity and
protection of the kingdom.

In addition to the Dagda, the people of Grimsete
also                          acknowledge Licha, a Shee countess who dwells
beneath the castle. Licha, while not a deity, is seen as
a guardian spirit of the castle and is offered tributes
and respect by the king and his subjects. She
demands little other than occasional company,
tastes of all foods prepared for the king to detect
poisons, and brief moments alone with condemned
men before their execution. Licha enjoys the
company, the food, and sustains herself on the
criminals' fear of death.

Population: Heavy. Grimsete is the only place in
Maedoen                            with this many people in this small a place.
Anywhere else, the population is going to be
moderate at most.

Economy: A bastion of war, Grimsete has great need
of                           weapons. It can buy iron, copper, and tin ore to
forge its own, if necessary, because the castle has a
foundry in its depths and there are many
metalworkers in the city. It is easier for the garrison
to purchase weapons, as smiths are often busy
repairing weapons or dealing with other projects.

Home to many people, Grimsete is too large to
sustain                              itself on locally produced foodstuffs, and the
city needs to import 15–25% of its comestibles each
year.

Noteworthy Places

As one of the largest cities in Maedoen, Grimsete
certainly                             has a few tourist attractions.

Grimsete Castle: The castle that started it all stands
tall                                over the rest of the city. Situated advantageously
on a low hill above Grimsete itself, the castle’s three
towers are strong and its wall is thick. Rumors that
the castle was built on a shee mound are wrong
(Licha came to live in the castle of her own accord),
but it does have strange qualities. Viewed from
above, the pattern of the castle’s interior and
exterior walls form something very like a Celtic knot,
which lends resilience to Grimsete Castle’s defenses,
subtle strength to its men, and mystical power to
druidic enchantments cast within. The second
mystery is that of the castle’s founders. The name is
written clearly at the gate and in the grand hall for all
to see, but it is foreign to the local tongues. Even the
druids have not been able to decipher its origin. In
truth, visitors who came long ago from a distant
land, in peace instead of war, designed Grimsete
Castle and laid its first stones. Its magic is of their
invention, and they left as peacefully as they came.

Adweth Hill: Gently sloping and covered with lush
grass,                              but just taller than a man from its base to its
peak, Adweth Hill is exactly one mile south of
Grimsete’s southernmost point. It has always been
so, since there was nothing more than a castle and
despite the many years of Grimsete’s slow
expansion. This is one of its magical properties. Few
notice, because it’s hard to notice something that
moves so slowly, and the memory plays tricks to
make it seem normal.

Adweth Hill is a very comfortable place for a picnic
or                               an outdoor lesson. The springy grass makes a
natural cushion, and the slight trees on the hill
provide cooling shade. Despite being a popular place
to visit, it is never crowded. Adweth Hill subtly

directs those approaching it to an unoccupied spot or
grove; if there is no good place vacant on the hill,
people just find themselves going elsewhere on their
walk. They never notice. One going just to see the
hill, not to occupy a place, never has any trouble
getting there.

There are also a few noticeable peculiarities about
Adweth                                 Hill that make the local populace think of it
as something special. Whenever there is a storm, one
and only one lightning bolt strikes the hill. There is
never any evidence of the strike afterward. People
who sleep on the hill all dream of the same thing:
themselves, onboard a vast ship of silvery-blue
wood, sailing into a storm. No one knows what it
means. Despite these strange qualities, the Gan
Creadigeath has not forbidden going to the hill, or
even mentioned it, so the people of Grimsete feel
confident in visiting it. In fact, the oldest treaties
between the Gan Creadigeath and the shee states that
no law, rule, pact, or treaty may address Adweth Hill.
The Gan Creadigeath cannot warn people away from
it without breaching the old agreements. The reason
for the shee’s stipulation is that Adweth Hill is where
the shee of Maedoen must gather for their foretold
mass exodus to their homeland. When they return to
the land of the fairy from the hill, life in Maedoen
will change immensely.

Vendors and Dealers

In a city the size of Grimsete, there’s a buyer for
almost any prize.

Porreth Bazaare: A few minutes’ walk from the city’s
northeastern gate, the stone buildings open away
from the street to reveal a wide, cobblestone plaza
over half a mile across. Hundreds of large booths and
small stands spread out before visitors to the city,
and scores of dancers, jugglers, barkers, other
entertainers, and salesmen compete with each other.
There are people there whose sole tasks are to
welcome travelers to Porreth Bazaar, where anything
and everything can be bought or sold. Many

298


hundreds of merchants and traders come to Porreth
Bazaar                               to pick up new merchandise or divest
themselves of their wares. There is almost always an
interested buyer, no matter how common or rare the
item in question, and only the most completely
worthless things go unsold. Nothing but cold-
wrought iron is illegal here (and even that can be
part of an under-the-table exchange). The criers
who welcome people to the bazaar call to them to
leave their cold iron behind; booths at the bazaar’s
border keep items for people until they return with
the claim ticket.

The reason for the restriction on cold iron goods is
that one-tenth of the fair’s grounds, that in the very
center, is given over at all times to the shee. The
beautiful, taffeta-and-velvet tents there are not
always occupied, but there are strange trades to be
made when they are. Some fairy folk happily
exchange solely normal goods, trading bales of
cotton for bronze blades and shields, and there is
always at least one such among the shee crowd.

Where the goods they trade come from is a happy
mystery                              to most who receive them. Others exchange
something exotic for something normal. In one
direction, a mortal might trade the memory of a
beating for a collection of fine carving woods; in the
other, one might give an expertly-made metal
puzzle for the ability to control one’s dreams.

Finally, some of the shee deal only in the strange and
magical. These are the ones who can give you a new
face in exchange for your true love, or a mighty
enchanted sword for a firstborn child.

Surrounding Porreth Bazaar are many large
warehouses                             where merchants carrying stock in bulk
can stow goods until they sell them. The warehouses
offer another function as well as space: providing
exchange tokens. When a set of goods is registered,
the warehouse factor verifies what is to be sold with
a series of tokens. These are generally about the size
of a palm, cut from wood, and painted to represent
common lots of trade goods, like bales of hay, large
quantities of foods, weapons, and so on. Marked with

the trader’s name or sigil, they can be taken into the
fair                               and sold, whereupon the buyer can bring the
tokens to the warehouse to claim his purchases.

The king in Grimsete also uses the warehouses to
calculate                               taxes. There are few alternatives to
dropping one’s goods off there, and limited storage
room in the bazaar itself, so the warehouse factors
record the goods and declare a tax on behalf of the
king. Some factors are corrupt, some are fair, some
lax, and careful merchants make sure they know the
factors they deal with. Most smaller goods go
untaxed in Porreth Bazaar, despite the law that
anything sold for a certain amount or more be
reported. Just in case, the king has shrewd agents
who wander the stalls, keeping their eyes peeled for
anything that the king would want to know was
being traded in Grimsete. Sometimes such objects
are confiscated, sometimes confiscated with
compensation, sometimes they are taxed, and
sometimes they are ignored. Not that it’s too difficult
to trade without attracting any attention, which is

299


AINERÊVE


the preferred option for grave robbers, thieves, and
other “treasure hunters.”

Argoel Artaith: Argoel is an ancient witch. Her age
and                          provenance are unknown, but her tinted skin
and her strange magic mark her as foreign to
Maedoen. Sisters Gan Creadigeath used to visit her
often to inquire about her methods, but she rebuffed
them all and now they keep away. People whisper
that she came from a far land and took a new
Maedoen name, and they are right. But she never
speaks of her past.

The witch makes and sells potions, tinctures,
salves,                           ointments, and other mixtures, all with
special properties. Many of them are simply for
healing, but they work surprisingly well and
sometimes even leave no scars. Some of her oils do
other things, like speeding plants’ growth,
strengthening woods or metals, or bursting into
flame when opened. Argoel Artaith is constantly
ordering myriad exotic ingredients for her
concoctions, including quicksilver, gold, silver,
cinnabar, and many rare herbs. She pays well for
them, and never seems short of coin or barter goods.

Guilds and Training

The Armsmen of the King: There are not many guilds
in                           Grimsete. Gwalter’s armsmen are closest to a
group of guildsmen or people offering weapons
training. One may join them with a simple oath of
loyal service to the king, at which point one is
expected to live with them, sup with them, and train
with them. It is an occupation, not just a club.

Without joining for life, a warrior can train with
them                                for a small bit of coin. They may be loyal to
their king, but he’s never told them not to spar save
with brother armsmen. So it isn’t hard to learn a
little sword or spearwork from the king’s skilled
men, but going for lessons every day of the week will
see the armsmen urging a warrior, especially a
skilled one, to join them. After all, the pay is decent,
the food is okay, the lodging is certain, and one more

person in the ranks means a greater chance of
leaving the next war alive.

Adventure Hooks

Here are a couple of possible adventures in Grimsete.

Rebellion: Two would-be lesser kings, acting
together,                              have surprised Gwalter ap Dagda and
besieged Grimsete and the castle while the bulk of
his armsmen deal with an incursion by horned
demons many miles north. The warlords have
refused to obey Gwalter’s commands despite his
right of rule. Together, their armies outnumber the
remaining men Gwalter can field from his local
garrison, and he hasn’t been able to get the word out
to his forces elsewhere or his still-loyal kings.

Gwalter is a fierce warrior and a skilled tactician, but
even he can’t beat a force four times his size, one
that also has the advantage of preparation. Gwalter
needs some help, which is where the players’
characters come in.

Most simply, they can slip or break through the
siege                               lines to bring word from Gwalter to some of his
manned outposts. Alerting enough soldiers means
that the two kings trying to depose Gwalter will end
up trapped between a new army and the hard walls of
Grimsete. More directly, the heroes could seek out
and kill or kidnap the two rebelling kings. Gwalter
would prefer to have them alive, because it would be
more politically advantageous to defeat and chastise
the kings than to kill them and be replaced by
revenge-minded sons. Still, either action will end the
siege.

The heroes could also supplement Gwalter’s army
with                          diplomacy or creative warfare. The shee in
Porreth Bazaar may be willing to sell military aid for
some price, who really knows? And the potions of
Argoel Artaith could do interesting things to a
besieging army, especially when catapulted on top of
them en masse.

Theft: Something of value has been stolen from
Grimsete Castle, and it’s time to catch the thief.

300


Emlyn Steward is certain that the criminal did not
have                              time to leave the city before he shut the gates
and stopped letting anyone in or out, and that there
was no other way out of the castle. Tension is
running high in Grimsete, especially as traveling
merchants lose money, people are getting hungrier,
and no one even knows what’s disappeared. If the
players’ characters want to leave, they’ll have to
sneak past all the king’s guards (and the two small
armies that have since settled in outside the walls, if
you want to combine this with the first scenario), or
find the thief.

But what’s been stolen? It could be something as
straightforward as a great treasure. Perhaps it’s the
Heart of Grimsete, something Gwalter would
certainly want back, and he wouldn’t want any more
people than necessary to know it was missing. On the
other hand, the stolen object might be a private
message from Gwalter, giving away the king’s
intention to do away with the lesser kings or weaken
the Gan Creadigeath, neither something he would
want his targets to find out.

Psarmorum

Psarmorum is home to racial and religious purists
descended                            from the Templars and pilgrims. They
derive their magical strength from their
unrecognized demon blood and worship Sol Invictus,
whom they call the Lord and the one true god, but
who is actually a powerful demon, Baphomet. The
government is headed by the Grand Master and
strongly influenced by the politically powerful Order
of Knights, the Bishop, and other noblemen and
religious figures.

Geography

Geographically, Psarmorum is bounded on the west
by                              the Orllewin Sea. This is the Maedoen name,
which the Psarmorum settlers eventually adopted,
having originally named it after an ocean of Earth.
The nation is structured much as France is, with

coastal plains giving way to hilly forests and
mountainous                            terrain in the south and southeast,
although none of the landmarks are specific analogs
to those on Earth. Between the plains and the forests,
the center is a small desert area with several small,
fertile valleys. There, the first settlers of the area
found an abandoned city that reminded them of their
destination: today, it is the site of the new Temple
Mount.

As one travels farther south or north, the land
becomes                               less settled and more dangerous. There are
strange, ungodly things; monsters and abominations
that hunger for the flesh or dreams of man. Ships
that sail too far out to sea, beyond the small and
desolate islands off the nation’s coasts, do not
return. The Istigh Sea is unnavigable because of
maelstroms and monsters.

Only to the west do the settled lands continue, and
then                               they become significantly dangerous. Along the
northern half of the nation’s western border is the
Forest of Meath, where demons and angels dwell.

The uneducated believe that the forest is a gateway
on                              Earth to both Heaven and Hell. Wiser heads know
that it is a place of frightening magic, which serves
as a passage to the heathen nation of Meath, and
contains gateways to Heaven and Hell.

Strange nomads dwell beyond the nation’s borders,
on                               the edge of the unsettled lands, or beyond. Often,
they are not quite human. Many of them have
strange eyes, hair, or skin; usually, a unique tribal
trait. These tribes are universally heathens in the
Templars’ eyes. The people of Psarmorum and these
barbarians often war. They are one reason why the
Templar Knights and their armies, much larger than
those of Maedoen, have not crushed their Celtic
enemies.

History

The generally known history of Psarmorum is soon
told.                                A large band of Templar Knights, including
members of all ranks, protecting a group of several

301


AINERÊVE


thousand on a long pilgrimage from France to
Jerusalem,                           somehow found themselves in a new and
different land instead. Separated from the world they
knew and with no way back, the knights organized
the “immigrants” to ensure survival. That began the
pattern of government by the Poor Knights of the
Faith that continues to this day. The Knights claimed
the new land for civilization, named a Master
Templar of the region and a provisional bishop
(pending approval by the Pope), and went about
making the land livable.

After a century or two of defending themselves
against                               the nightmares of Ainerêve (records are
vague), the Templar Knights named the land with
some forgotten Latin tag as a sign of pieType: this
name soon was shortened Psarmorum. They raised
their master to Grandmaster and decided the Pope’s
approval was implicit, accepting that their
separation from France and Rome was permanent.
The nation flourished, growing mighty in battle and
strong in faith; its priests working miracles and its
leaders advised by angels. So far, the war of two
hundred years with Maedoen is just a grace note on
the nation’s already long history.

The nation’s secret histories, recorded only within
the                           Temple Mount vaults, are not so simple. The
outer circle of Psarmorum’s elite — low-ranking
Templars, nobles, ecclesiastics, those holding office

— know more of the nation’s early years. Angels and
archangels of the Lord came to the knights and
pilgrims lost in a strange land, offering blessings,
aid, and guidance in founding a new nation and
renewed church in Ainerêve. As part of this aid, these
celestials shared their essence and nature with the
Templars, imbuing them and their children with the
heavenly strength and righteous power needed to
combat the strange enemies that assailed them. The
first generation of half-angel children was called the
Nephilim; the angels trained them to be guardians of
the realm. Legend has it that they still live and patrol
the far reaches of the land, guarding it against
incursion.

The Church Celestial, whose colors of gold, red, and
white fly above Psarmorum’s cathedrals and armies,
was but a change of lineaments for the old church
since it made sense to use new names and forms of
worship for a fresh start in a new land. The holy
trinity of Sol, Luna, and Astra (sun, moon, stars) is
much as it ever was. Celestials (angels to the
unlettered) still confer their wisdom upon those of
high rank and may aid any station’s pious.

The inner circle of Psarmorum’s elite, the highest-
ranking                          Templars and nobles, know more of the
truth. The leaders of the original band of Knights
Templar secretly worshipped the demon Baphomet.
Knights adjudged worldly and wicked enough were
initiated into occult rites and promised wealth and
power. When the stars were right, the demon could
use the link magically forged by worship to summon
the Templars and the pilgrims they escorted from
Earth to Ainerêve. It was not angels who came to the
aid of the pilgrimage, but Baphomet’s vassal demons
in heavenly guise, who granted the power to survive.
Today, the blood of demons flows, to lesser or
greater degrees, in the veins of all Psarmorum’s
nobility, kept strong by periodic reinfusion.

Since its beginning, the demons who started the
slow                             process of corruption have guided and shaped
Psarmorum through always plausible and wise-
seeming advice to the high and mighty. The Church,
too, has changed, and the faith is not what it was. It
was close at first, and there were genuine saints early
on whose relics now have power in this magical
world. The celestial imagery was a cloak, though, and
the change of names essential to Baphomet’s plan
since names have power.

Sol Invictus

Baphomet is the true ruler of Psarmorum, but
presents                            himself as Sol (Invictus), a pure,
implacable, and warlike god, whose other aspects
(Luna, Astra) deal with facets such as mercy and a
savior figure. Through his priests, Baphomet talks of
brotherhood, purity, and faith to harness those who

302


believe in such things to work for him. Over time,
relying                               on faulty human memory, he has magically
changed scripture to stress unquestioning
obedience, fierce piety, conformity, and intolerance
of mystical creatures, outsiders, or any that are lax in
devotion. Even so, redemptive aspects remain and
clues for the truly perceptive.

Baphomet, like many demons, sought power.
Unlike                                the rest, he had cunning and patience, kept
his bargains, and achieved it. He and his vassal
demons left Satan’s court in Hell when his plans
were ripe. With the aid of two other entities, he was
able to work the great magic that opened a major
revorage rift to bring the knights and pilgrims to
Ainerêve. In exchange, they gain some measure of
power via worship as Luna and Astra’s aspects in his
unholy trinity. (Luna is his consort, Lilith; Astra’s
identity is unknown.) To harness the full strength of
(demon-tainted) humanity over the long term,
Baphomet needed to have good and evil serve him
alike, so he had to maintain the illusion of
righteousness. His ‘celestials’ thus include disguised
demons and peris, recruited from the stable land of
Persian myth.

Peris are good, very attractive fay with magical
powers,                               long life, and mortals’ passions, who often
take winged form. They are happy to help deserving
souls in angelic ways, so Baphomet employs peris for
such lesser matters and to keep up appearances, and
at times to bolster troops’ morale when raiding
Maedoen. In return for their aid, he promised them
help in their eternal war with the cruel and ugly
deevs (Persian demons). Peris often need help from
mortal heroes in this struggle, and Baphomet
supplies them knights of great prowess who prove
not to be “morally flexible” enough for high rank. He
keeps serving peris out of his way in the Forest of
Meath, where they clash with other demons (all
deevs to them).

Baphomet now has a temporal and spiritual power
base                              in Psarmorum: a nation of fierce warriors
dedicated to him (in his persona as Sol Invictus),

with little of the fickleness of pure demons. What his
plans are, only he knows — world domination? True
godhood? Only the wisest of sages know enough to
speculate.

Baphomet’s success infuriated Satan and his
demons                             beyond measure, and they strive against
him and his people just as hard as they ever fought
against good. In turn, Baphomet makes sure that
Psarmorum’s rulers ruthlessly hunt down and
destroy those demons not in thrall to him, and those
people they “turn from the light.” This helps keep
the populace on their toes, suspicious, and in a state
of fear, and thus more easily controlled. And since
Church and State are “fighting the good fight”
against genuine servants of darkness, creatures of
the pit, and devil-worshippers, who could doubt
their essential virtue?

The People: People living in Psarmorum come in two
basic types: citizens and brothers. Brothers are those
who served in the army. They are typically accorded
more freedom and authority than citizens, that is,
everyone else. Citizens can be influential by noble
birth or wealth, and brothers can get trod upon, say
if they were simple infantry in the military but have
returned to civilian life. A person’s status as brother
or citizen is secondary. A wealthy citizen still has
power over a poor mason, but a brother mason has
an advantage over a citizen mason down the street.

Baphomet’s demons have often been surprised by
the people they think they control, for instance,
when the Knights Templar decided there was no
return to Earth and avoided a complete civil war.

Still, they are pleased with their work. As strictly
conformist                            as the country is now, the demons could
leave it alone for years without the risk of it
becoming any more tolerant or pleasant in nature.

Baphomet sees the benefit of alloying evil with
some                            good to make it stronger and gradually
extending the inner circle of true initiates. His
demons are more impatient and would like to see a
wholly dissolute nation that openly worships

303


AINERÊVE


Baphomet (which would, of course, burn itself up in
an                               orgy of demonic debauchery in a generation or
two). Baphomet keeps them on plan, working on the
very slow corruption he knows is the only way to
retain his power. The demons still compete through
their charges, as is their nature. They have a lot of
work to do, but that’s what they get for starting on a
people as dedicated as a large group of knights and
pilgrims.

Population: Moderate. There are some very densely-
populated cities in Psarmorum, but there’s a lot of
space devoted entirely to farming or lies unused.

Economy: Since Maedoen is the closest nation, and
the                             people of Psarmorum consider them godless
heathens, there isn’t a lot of real trade between
them. Individual merchants sometimes brave the
forest to sell and bring back goods that bring high
prices, but there is nothing on a significant scale and
no “official” exports or imports.

What the people of Maedoen most prefer to
purchase                            from Psarmorum’s brave traders is the
weaponry they manage to get through Meath.

Psarmorum produces sturdy, sometimes excellent, if
not exceptional, weapons and armor, and Maedoen is
happy to have them. Merchants traveling between
the two nations (not to mention just to and from the

Forest of Meath) also make good money selling
each’s                     regional artwork.

There is more trade with Dalmavand, although it is
smaller and farther away, since it is seen as less
threatening and has good-quality coal and special
mineral ores that are used with Psarmorum’s own
iron ore to make good-quality steel. Dalmavand gets
finished arms in return. Dalmavandish
intermediaries have also been used for trade between
Psarmorum and Maedoen when there are active
hostilities.

There are tribes of heathens, usually barbaric, who
live                            beyond the nation’s boundaries and threaten the
people’s welfare. But even so, some traders make
their money selling good steel weapons to the
warlike tribes or bringing back their native arts as
oddities. These carvings, musical instruments, and
hide paintings are occasionally considered beautiful
works of art but are usually treated as little more
than cheap curios.

Internally, Psarmorum is largely agrarian, as it
must                                be to feed its populace. Many large farming
communities have reliable buyers in the middlemen
who transport and sell the crops (mostly grains) to
the major cities. Threats to the nation’s welfare —
from barbarians, monsters, demons, demon
worshippers, and others — are common enough to
keep the military elite in control of the country and
the military well-funded. Danger from the west is
rare and often more easily faced on land, so
Psarmorum’s navy is weak.

Local Pantheon

The Holy Trinity (Sol, Luna, Astra), and the
Celestials                               (the host of angels). Opposing them, Satan
and his demonic hordes.

People of Psarmorum may not be faithful to a man,
but                             those that aren’t pretend to be. To call its
atmosphere that of an inquisition would be
excessive, but not by a great deal. One who does not
go to church weekly gets funny looks, less business,

304


and sometimes social abuse (thrown vegetables and
the                              like). A person or family who is not pious enough
is encouraged to change, and those who do not
change convincingly enough must go on a state-
organized pilgrimage to find their faith. People
suspected of demon worshipping in any form
whatsoever are thoroughly investigated and, if found
guilty, executed or sentenced to hard labor.

Farther from the nation’s centers of population,
some                           villages are harsher or laxer. There are even
some villages where they worship not at all or the
wrong god. When the Templar Knights learn of such
a place, they punish the disbelievers.

Local Authorities

Psarmorum maintains an army large enough to
withstand                                a prolonged assault from a serious force.
They have had to do so several times over the
nation’s long history, so nobody questions the
choice to have the army now. Only the Templar order
is allowed to field an organized and armed force
larger than ten people, so all citizens belong to the
military order (if only loosely). The army is called
“the Sword of Invictus” officially, but the title is
rarely used outside formal writings. In conversation,
it is simply “the army,” “the military,” or “the
sergeants’ lesser brothers.”

The army has five main stations in Psarmorum.
One                                 is near the Temple Mount, and the other four are
near clusters of significant cities or tactical
importance points. Most cities also have smaller
garrisons to provide police services and local defense
until the larger units march to relieve them.

Notes: Bishop Mallory is often seen in public wearing
formal                               robes, under which he discreetly carries a
knife for defense or utility. His prominent accessory
is the Mitre staff, an item that enhances his
hiereiticism spellcasting by lowering the challenge
rating of spells. The staff, although not intended for
combat, can serve as a weapon if needed due to its
sturdy gold headpiece and ceremonial design. Bishop
Mallory's approach leans towards diplomacy and
spiritual guidance rather than physical
confrontation. He only turns to combat when all
other options have been exhausted.

Treasure: Substantial church resources.

Noteworthy Places

Most landmarks are better described on a local level,
but                               a few stand out.

Astra’s Threshold: This is a giant archway formed
within                              the trunk of a massive, ancient oak tree,
leading into a giant, dark hollow for most of the year.

The Bishop of Psarmorum, head of the Order of
Chaplains,                           gathers here with the highest-ranking of
the priesthood during the summer solstice to greet
the angels (peris), who often lead them into battle.
This site is actually one of the mysterious Equinox
Gates, a transdimensional portal commandeered by
the will of Baphomet and the strong beliefs of
Psarmorum’s devout. Legend has it that the tree
absorbed the fallen Shee Lords’ souls during Astra’s
Last Battle, their blood fusing with its sap. The
ceremonial use of shee blood can wrench the gates
open during the equinoxes. The local devil
worshipers have tried this on several occasions, but
the Poor Knights of the Faith guard Astra’s
Threshold well.

portal is related to the mysterious Equinox Gates of
Crossroads. The local devil worshipers have tried to
perform this ceremony on several occasions, but the
Poor Knights of the Faith guard Astra’s Threshold
well.

Cathedral Astra: In western Psarmorum, Cathedral
Astra                                is a towering religious edifice known for its
celestial architecture. Made from a rare, luminous
stone that glows softly in the moonlight, it is
adorned with intricate carvings of religious symbols
and stained glass windows depicting Sol Invictus and
his three aspects: Sol Invictus, Luna, and Astra.

Worshippers gather here for sacred ceremonies,
unaware                               of the true nature of their deities. As a
bastion of faith and administration, Cathedral Astra
serves as Bishop Mallory's headquarters, from where
he tends to both the spiritual and secular needs of his
flock.

306


Codexhall: In central Psarmorum, Codexhall is a
grand                             library and center of scholarly pursuits,
housing ancient tomes and serving as a repository of
vast knowledge.

Divinitas Spire: In western Psarmorum, Divinitas
Spire                               is a towering religious edifice known for its
celestial architecture. Made from a rare, luminous
stone that glows softly in the moonlight, and
adorned with intricate carvings of religious symbols
with stained glass windows depicting Sol Invictus
and his three aspects. Worshippers gather here for
sacred ceremonies.

Echolight: In southern Psarmorum, Echolight is a
sacred temple where sound and light converge to
create mesmerizing phenomena, believed to be
divine manifestations of the Lord Sol. Harmonic
chants by the Monks of Luna resonate within
echoing halls. Encased within the temple is the
Equinox Gate, which facilitates rare and powerful
magical events, further enhancing the site's sacred
status..

Grand River: So named for its enormous width and
inexorably steady flow, the Grand runs from east to
west, cutting the nation of Psarmorum roughly in
half. At some places in flatter terrain, the river is as
much as two to three miles wide. There, it is gentle
and fairly slow; it is never low enough to be forded,
but the villages that thrive along its slower reaches
provide bounties of fish for the rest of the nation,
and there are constantly sails on the water there.

Higher in the hills, the Grand River is narrower,
faster,                        and much less forgiving.

The mountain river men who float rafts and barges
filled                             with ore and other goods down to the cities
from the mountains and high towns are legends of
sorts in the rest of Psarmorum. Men who ply the
river in quieter waters share tall tales inspired by the
horrible rapids and white waters the mountain river
men must face. Many of the stories aren’t too far off
the mark.

Lumenhall: In the heart of Psarmorum, Lumenhall
shines                               as a hub of learning and discovery. This grand
edifice, dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge, draws
scholars and mages from across the land. Within its
vast halls, ancient texts are studied, magical
research conducted, and discoveries shared. Known
for its library of rare manuscripts, Lumenhall’s
architecture—illuminated by glowing runes and
light-infused crystals—reflects a relentless quest for
wisdom. Hidden within its archives lie secrets tied to
Luna, the goddess of forbidden knowledge.

Marinveil: In southwestern Psarmorum, Marinveil is
a                              coastal enclave renowned for its maritime culture
and sea-based economy. Located along the shores of
the Gulf of Azure, Marinveil thrives on fishing, trade,
and shipbuilding. The town's picturesque harbor is
dotted with vibrant fishing boats and merchant
vessels, and its bustling markets are filled with
exotic goods from distant lands. Marinveil's
residents, known for their seafaring skills and deep
connection to the ocean, often worship Sol Invictus
in his aspect as the protector of sailors. The town
also serves as a vital link for Psarmorum’s trade
routes, making it a hub of activity and cultural
exchange.

Mont Blanc: It’s not the same shape as the original,
and                               it’s a little bit shorter, but it is always covered in
snow, and at least there’s no Italy to contest its
ownership in Ainerêve. The settlers from Earth
named it Mont Blanc before they knew any better,
and the name stuck. In the southeast, the three
monasteries that dot its slopes serve as common
destinations for the more devoted pilgrims.

Most of the remains of Grand Master de Sablé II,
one                               of the more renowned Grandmasters, were
interred somewhere on Mont Blanc’s slopes. Most
legends claim that he was buried with great wealth
and that his body will rise, armed with his great
sword Valiance and his heavy armor, to defend
Psarmorum should the need arise. The first is true,
and the second is somewhat off: the chaplains who

307


AINERÊVE


oversaw his burial worked sorceries on the grave.
Invoked                               by the proper rituals, de Sablé II’s spirit
comes to defend any holy man on Mont Blanc
(especially in the monasteries). Only a member of the
Order of Chaplains can call on him, and each
chaplain only once.

Sentinelle: Southeast of Vigilance, in southern
Psarmorum,                          Sentinelle is a fortified town
strategically positioned to guard against incursions
from the untamed southern wilderness. Known for
its robust defenses and vigilant watch, Sentinelle is a
bastion of safety and order. The town is home to a
contingent of well-trained soldiers who man its
walls and keep a constant lookout for potential
threats. Sentinelle's residents live under the
protection of these guardians, contributing to the
town’s economy through agriculture and
craftsmanship. The town's stronghold serves as a
command center, ensuring the security of
Psarmorum's southern borders.

Pont Glorieux: Facing the Forest of Meath to the
northwest,                            upriver from the unnavigable Istigh Sea,
sits the Pont Glorieux, the glorious bridge. Massive,
raised of smooth and polished granite and trimmed
with marble, the Pont Glorieux is wide enough for
one hundred men to cross abreast. Massive walls and
two strong garrisoned towers protect the west end of
the bridge from assault. The bridge was named not
only for its physical magnificence but also for the
ambitions of the Grandmaster who commissioned it.
The eastern end of the Safe Road through Meath was
originally meant for a triumphal mass invasion of
Maedoen. Other threats to Psarmorum and internal
politics mean this has never taken place as
envisaged.

The town to the east of the great bridge is one of
the                             army’s five main stations, with ten thousand
warriors and their support troops, much siege
weaponry (and the teams to operate them), and two
generals from the Order of Knights to command
them. Usually, about half the troops are on patrol

throughout the northern forest of Psarmorum or
along                               the Safe Road. Special task forces sometimes
dare the Forest of Meath itself. Besides general
tradespeople and so on in town, some trade
(legitimate and otherwise) goes on with Dalmavand,
Maedoen, and Meath.

Sol’s Gauntlets: These twin fortresses are so named
because they guarded the original northern river
border of Psarmorum at a natural crossing point.

Psarmorum has long since expanded into the
northern                             forests beyond, and the fortresses now
guard a mighty bridge that now provides the main
way across the Grand River. Although the garrison is
only a token force, a significant town has grown
around bridges and fortresses. There is a great deal
of wealth to be had by trading at the bridge, rather
than spending a week or longer finding the nearest
ferry or lesser bridge and paying more for a slower
crossing.

Vigilance: In southwestern Psarmorum near Mount
Aethertop, Vigilance is a fortified town symbolizing
martial readiness. Perched strategically at the base of
the towering mountain, Vigilance serves as the first
line of defense against threats from the wild and the
supernatural. The town is heavily garrisoned with
elite troops, always prepared to respond to any
incursions. Its robust walls and fortified gates reflect
the town’s commitment to security. Vigilance is also
a training ground for soldiers, with rigorous drills
and exercises conducted regularly. The town’s strong
martial culture is complemented by a disciplined and
resilient populace, dedicated to protecting
Psarmorum from any danger..

Voldefeu Volcano: Near Vigilance in southwestern
Psarmorum,                         Voldefeu Volcano is a volcanic region
steeped in elemental and fiery history. This imposing
volcano is rumored to be the home of a volitional
demi-plane of an ancient dragon, whose fiery
essence permeates the surrounding land. The region
is marked by frequent volcanic activity, with rivers of
molten lava and sulfurous vents that remind visitors

308


of the primal forces at play. This area is also rich in
rare minerals and crystals, attracting daring
adventurers and scholars seeking to harness its
elemental energy.

Guilds and Training

There is only one “guild” notable on a national scale
in                         Psarmorum, and it is central to the country’s
entire way of life. It offers training on a very limited
scale to non-members.

The Orders of Knights, Sergeants, and Chaplains:
Originally,                            each of these was a specific rank among
the Poor Knights of the Faith. Knights were the
order’s champions, heavy cavalry, deadly in battle
and inspiring to men. Sergeants were the light
cavalry and heavy infantry, formidable opponents on
their own, but especially skilled in fighting as groups
or units. Chaplains were ordained priests and served
the order’s spiritual needs.

After many centuries in which a nation developed
around                               the order and its practices, these offices have
changed somewhat. Templar knights no longer have
to swear to poverty and chastity, and all but the most
skilled buy their way into the position with some
financial gift to the Temple Mount. They serve
Psarmorum as the army’s generals (the least
experienced knights occasionally serve as lower-
ranking officers, but never lower than lieutenant
colonel). About half the nobility belong to the Order
of Knights, and the Grandmaster is the head of this
order, though he is rarely the most martially capable.

Though they are all called knights, the order has a
complex system of determining superiority. One
knight may outrank another based on military rank
(a brigadier general defers to a major general, for
example), achievements (a knight honored for
defending a pilgrimage against banditry has more
sway than one who has received no honors), or
experience (based mostly on age, but also accounting
for time in active service). The family has no official
effect on influence within the Order of Knights. Still,

a knight whose family has made a significant
donation                               to the Temple Mount is more likely to be
recognized by the Grandmaster and earn the esteem
necessary to boss around lesser knights.

Sergeants are significantly more numerous than
knights.                              This is because joining the Order of
Sergeants comes with fewer expectations of nobility
and wealth. Becoming a sergeant is a matter of
aptitude and dedication, and few who have even one
of those are turned away. Rarely, when the Order of
Knights refuses a nobleman’s son, that nobleman
may buy a place in the Order of Sergeants for the son;
it is better than nothing. Sergeants make up most of
the lower-ranking officers in the nation’s military,
nearly everything from the second lieutenant to
colonel.

309


AINERÊVE


Military Ranks of Psarmorum

Grand Master       Lieutenant-Sergeant

General, major       2nd Lieutenant-Sergeant

General, brigadier     Sergeant

Captain or colonel     Corporal

Lieutenant colonel    Archers

Major            Men-at-arms

Sergeant-colonel     Proletariat

Knights occasionally serve at similar ranks to the
highest-ranked sergeants; officially, when a
sergeant-colonel and a knight-colonel disagree, the
knight takes precedence. There is usually a higher-
ranking knight nearby who knows enough to take the
sergeant’s advice in practice. But not always — some
knights look down on the sergeants and stubbornly
refuse to see the wisdom in their words; others are
trapped by the politics that often surround military
decisions and let that force their hands.

Because no citizen of Psarmorum may participate
in                                 an organized armed force without being a member
of the Templars, the Temple Mount created the
Order of Sergeants. Citizens who join the army are
inducted as “lesser brothers,” which basically lets
them become infantry without initiating them into
the Templars’ serious mysteries. Not all Order of
Sergeants serve the Poor Knights in a military
capacity, and many have other skills. Knights
govern, and the chaplains see to faith, but everything
else falls to the sergeants. Often today, this means
administrative work. Most craftwork falls to non-
initiated citizens, who are directed and funded by
sergeants.

The Order of Chaplains started out seeing the piety
of                                the initiated Poor Knights of the Faith, but today it
serves all Psarmorum. All ordained priests, from the
Bishop of the city of the Temple Mount on down, are
initiated members of the order. They learn how to
read, give services, perform expected rituals
(weddings, funerals, etc.), and generally see to
people’s immortal souls. The Order of Chaplains is
the Church in Psarmorum.

After the ruling of Grand Master d’Echallens
changed                              magic from a source of evil to (at least in
part) a blessing from Lord Sol, it became the
province of the Order of Chaplains. When the army
marches, the chaplains march alongside to lead daily
prayer and support it with their arcane knowledge.

Chaplains use their magic in the course of their work
to                               heal the faithful, exorcise demons, and strike
down the unworthy, but also to manifest the divine
favor of Sol in their services. Just as the Grand
Master is rarely the best warrior, the Bishop of
Psarmorum (foremost ecclesiastical authority in the
nation and head of the Order of Chaplains) is not
always the mightiest theurgist, but more often a man
skilled in debate, philosophy, rhetoric, and politics.

Regional Monsters

Monsters in Psarmorum usually wander in from the
unsettled lands beyond the borders. They are
embodiments of the people’s fears: vaguely
demonic, vaguely human, all unholy or heathen.

Examples include devil worshipers and gethra.

Gethra

Type: Standard

Threat Rank: Ranged 2d10 ~ Melee ~ 2d8 ~ Natural
1d10

Hit Points: 46 (23/23) [normal, medium, mundane]

Damage Reduction: By armor or shield type

Saving Throw: 2d6

Battle Phase: 1d8

Notes: These creatures are not overly common, but
they                             appear with enough regularity to not be
considered unique. Gethra walk digitigrade, on
cloven hooves, and have the furred flanks of a goat or
deer up to their waists. Above the waist, they have a
muscled bare chest, and antlers top their heads. They
fight with crude spears or axes or steel weapons if
they can steal them. Gethra usually work alone and
are best known for kidnapping innocent villagers.

Most presume that the gethra eat them, and they
often                               do, but some gethra try to make their own little
villages out of their prisoners.

310


Items: Gethra carry crude spears or axes or steel
weapons                               if they can steal them. They do benefit from
specific weapon bonuses. These creatures usually
hold onto miscellaneous stolen goods, 4 × $100
worth.

Devil worshipers

Type: Minor to Exceptional

Threat Rank: Minor: Arcane d8 ~ Melee d4 ~ Ranged
d4                                ~ Natural d4

Standard: Arcane 2d8 ~ Melee d6 ~ Ranged d6 ~
Natural d4

Exceptional: Arcane 3d8 ~ Melee 2d6 ~ Ranged d8 ~
Natural d4

Hit Points: Minor 8, standard 32, exceptional 48
[normal, medium, mundane]

Damage Reduction: Standard +1 (cloak), exceptional
d6                               to d8 (armor) as well

Saving Throw: Minor 4, standard 8, exceptional d12

Battle Phase: d6

Notes: Devil worshipers are mostly human in
appearance,                            usually traveling in groups of ten to
thirty. At their worst, they have some light demonic
traits, like red-tinted skin and nubs of horns. They
despise Sol and revere Satan in all his wickedness. To
worship him, they perform evils in his name, from
ruining wagons to eating babies. Most travel rather
than settling; when there is a stationary community
that worships something other than the devil, they
are turned away.

Devil worshippers control sorceries proportional to
the                                evils they perpetrate. Some bands never do
anything worse than breaking things and
blaspheming, and they have minor magical powers.
Others are more dedicated to Hell, and they make
animal or human sacrifices and engage in ritual
orgies. Their powers are more varied and more
potent. Minor worshippers can cast Harm spells via
Hieraticism. Standard worshippers have that basic
power but can also Curse via Arcanum. Exceptional
worshippers have Harm, Curse, and can summon
imps or demons. The GM may add or subtract powers
as needed, of course.

Treasure: Minor worshippers have crude weapons
and                            only minor harm spells. Standard worshippers
wear cloaks unhallowed by demons, granting them

+1 damage reduction against every attack, and get
weapon-specific bonuses. Exceptional worshippers
often carry magical items of unhallowed nature and
sometimes wear leather to chain armor (d6 to d8).
Treasure: minor $50, standard $100, exceptional

$200.

Temple Mount

Description: The Temple Mount is the nerve center
of                                all life for the Poor Knights of the Faith and the
society that has arisen around them in the phantom
world of Ainerêve. Temple Mount properly refers
only to the fortress-cathedral at the foot of a
mountain, but most folks apply it to the grand city
surrounding it. Only scholars and chroniclers
remember and use the city’s old name,
Piusarmorum. It is a beehive of chaplain and
sergeant activity, and it is from here that Grand
Master de Chartres IV directs his knights’ activities.

Large enough to contain all of the order’s official
members                               in siege or emergency, the Temple Mount
was designed by Psarmorum’s first inhabitants as a
combination of temple and fortress. It provided both
consecrated ground where the order’s chaplains
could conduct holy services and a stronghold against
the terrifying creatures who constantly threatened
the Poor Knights in this strange land. The walls first
built around the Temple Mount marked an area 300
by 550 yards and stood at three men’s height. Within
the walls’ safety, the gold-domed temple provided a
respite from the apparently godless surroundings.

Since then, heathen armies have razed the Temple
Mount                            fortress twice and its surroundings several
times more. Each time, the Templar Knights have
rebuilt more strongly than before. Today, the Temple
Mount is visible from leagues away, its hundred-
yard-high cathedral roof and all six of its slender
towers sheathed in beaten gold. Its walls, now
twenty yards high and heavily defended by crossbow
and ballista, guard several square miles appropriated
by the holy order. The order’s experience with sieges
ensures it is prepared: the walls are well stocked with

311


AINERÊVE


missiles and other armaments and food enough to
keep a full complement of troops fed for weeks.

Scaling the wall with siege ladders is made hard by
the long iron spikes sticking out from the
battlements.

The city itself is a sprawling affair. It originally
grew                                up to house the pilgrims who came with the
Poor Knights into Ainerêve. The city’s first
incarnation was as a small agricultural center. With
each rebuild, the Templar Knights have had more
manpower and a stronger economy for
reconstruction. Archived maps of the city show its
evolution from a spread-out farming community to
an efficiently designed, stone-built city with
disordered peripheral areas (and, alas, a perennially

troublesome waste-removal system). Almost one out
of                              every ten buildings is a temple, minor or major, to
Sol, and any inhabitants who don’t pray regularly get
strange looks from their neighbors. Eventually,
Templar chaplains come to visit such malcontents,
who either reaffirm their piety or are told to go on a
state-sanctioned pilgrimage to one of Psarmorum’s
holy sites.

A large oasis, fed by an underground river, sits
beside                                the Temple Mount and city. It is used for local
agriculture. Pipes from the river provide water for
the city’s needs and keep the many underground
cisterns full. The city cisterns, which can be
separated from the river in case of poison, hold water
enough for a three-month siege or drought. Should
the city be lost, the Temple Mount itself could hold
against a siege for six months with full barracks.

Avinoble

Avinoble, a modest kingdom in the east bordering
Psarmorum, boasts abundant natural resources.
However, its fame is eclipsed by eerie legends and
fearsome creatures originating from the eastern
mountains.

King Leonard Avinoble III rules alongside his
queen,                             Clotilde. King Leonard Avinoble III and Queen
Clotilde's sons, Prince Robert and Prince Francois,
lack the charm and renown of their father, much to
the king's dismay.

King Leonard's reign, characterized by strict
adherence                              to an ancient chivalric code and proactive
leadership in battles, has somewhat tarnished his
reputation, sparking frequent rebellions.

While the people of Avinoble enjoy relative safety,
it                              comes at a cost. Due to high military expenditures,
poverty has increased, leading to serfs working
harder. Consequently, many seek refuge in the army,
drawn by its promise of fair compensation, despite
its perils. King Leonard, accompanied by his knights,

312


regularly scours his domain, battling the formidable
creatures                         that lurk within.

Avinoble is split into two baronies. Rivervale, the
larger                              and safer region, owes its peace to the vigilant
knights. This safety has fostered trade, enriching the
land further. Monster incursions from the eastern
mountains are rare but swiftly dealt with.

Gastogne, despite its fertile lands, is troubled. The
area                                is shrouded in darkness due to the ominous
presence of the Harvester of Souls and its cult
followers. The organized raiding parties formed by
the growing goblin population in the willow marshes
hint at the presence of an unseen, intelligent force.

The Butterfly Wood presents its own set of
challenges.                             Elves have claimed sovereignty over the
forest due to a gateway to the fey world, which has
stopped human intrusion, especially lumberjacking.
The local baron's attempts to regain control were
thwarted by the unexpectedly large elf population,
raising suspicions of otherworldly influences or
sorcery reshaping the woods.

Compounding Gastogne's woes, its neighbor,
Rivervale,                             seeks to sever northern ties due to fears of
the Harvester's cult. This has led to heightened
tensions between the baronies, with Baron Marcel
Laberge and Baron St-Pierre Duval often clashing at
their borders. The conflicts in the region primarily
affect the local villages.

In the religious sphere, while most Avinoblians
worship                             Sol, a new knightly order founded by the
king venerates Sekhmet, a deity encountered in the
hidden valley of Aigypt. Sekhmet, a formidable deity
with a lion-human hybrid form, is fluent in the
Avinoble tongue and stands almost ten feet tall.

Although Sekhmet faces rivalry from other deities in
this newfound pantheon, like Osiris, Isis, Horus, and
others, the deities avoid direct conflict, subtly vying
for mortal worship to enhance their power.

Seth, the avatar of chaos and fear, dominates the
southern lands of Aigypt as a formidable hybrid of
fearsome creatures.

Dalmavand

Dalmavand is a land of mountains, rivers, and
forests.                              The northern part of Dalmavand is a cold,
mountainous region with snow-capped peaks and
deep valleys. The southern part of Dalmavand is
more temperate, with rolling hills and lush forests.
The Echoes Forest is located in the southern part of
Dalmavand and is said to be home to a powerful
spirit named Sylvadran

History of Dalmavand

Maedoen was once a fractious land of warring kings,
and                            occupied the whole of the peninsula of which it
now forms the southern part. Then armies of
monsters known as the cythraul invaded from the
sea, slaughtering and enslaving almost at will, since
Maedoen’s many lords paid more heed to their own
quarrels than to the cythraul invasion. For a time it
seemed as if the whole nation would be picked off
piecemeal. Two things stopped this: the appearance
of the Black Standard, rallying an army from people
across the nation regardless of local allegiances, and
the complete overrunning of the north by the
cythraul. These finally caused the remaining lords
and petty kings to put aside their differences (for the
time being) and join (reluctantly) against the
common foe with each other and with Maedeon’s
shee. The cythraul were beaten back and their raids
tailed off, but it was too late for the northern third of
Maedoen, which was largely depopulated and left in
ruins.

Even in dream worlds, Nature abhors a vacuum.
Few                             refugees wanted to return to the colder and
mistier north from the temperate south, but others
found their way to the ravaged land from Earth. The
Varangian Guard were elite soldiers in the Byzantine
army who served as personal bodyguards to the
emperor, recruited mainly from Norsemen with
some Anglo-Saxons. Skilled warriors with a tradition
of faithful service, they played a decisive role in

313


AINERÊVE


many wars. A large group of them returning from
battle                                by sea ran into some Barbary pirates with
ships full of captive Circassian girls destined for the
slave markets. The pirates were swiftly
exterminated, and the young women were being
freed when an unnatural storm blew up: this was a
maritime revorage rift, a gate between worlds, that
transported all the entangled Byzantine and Barbary
ships from Earth to Ainereve, where they made
landfall on the coast of the near-deserted northern
part of the Maedoen peninsula. As with other
transportees, the people found out that they were no
longer on Earth, and decided to settle where they
were. Over time their descendents slowly
repopulated the area which was to become
Dalmavand.

Along the marches of the Forest of Echoes, the
once-proud Maedoen city of Dalma was brought to
ruin as the terrible scourge of the cythraul swept
through the land. Its magnificent central Vas keep
remained intact, defended to the last by a famous
hero named Vand, in one of the north’s final, bitter
battles against the monsters. Centuries later, the
descendents of the Varangian Guard discovered the
place, and found in the miraculously preserved keep
a literary masterpiece which recounted the city’s
final stand, written by one of the few survivors.

Inspired by this tale, “Vand’s Desolation,” which
included                               a prophecy that the powerful warrior’s
spirit would be reborn when the cythraul once again
posed a major threat, the people rebuilt the city of
Dalma, and decided to make it capital of their new
land. The realm was renamed Dalmavand. Their
leader, Clarion, was crowned king, and married a
beautiful young woman named Alastrine. They took
the surname Vand as a royal honorific, and their
subjects took to calling themselves Vandians. The
people as a whole are hardy and fierce fighters, but
defenders rather than conquerors.

By the time the kingdom was established, a large
population of elves had moved into the Echoes
forest. The elves refused to allow the citizens of

Dalmavand to cut timber and deforest the land
eastward,                            thus causing many a border skirmish. An
uneasy truce now prevails, but the forest fay near
Dalma, while much like the shee in the forest of
Meath, are less hostile than those in the
Cresylvadran area to the south.

Population: Dalmavand’s population is a mix of
small                             villages, hamlets, moderately sized towns, and
larger cities. The smaller settlements primarily focus
on specific trades such as agriculture or fishing,
maintaining a traditional way of life. The towns
serve as trading hubs, offering diverse professions
and services, while the larger cities are bustling with
merchants, scholars, and adventurers, providing
opportunities for knowledge, wealth, and intrigue.

The capital, Dalma, although declined from its

314


former glory, still holds significant historical and
cultural                             value, and its population reflects the hardy
and resilient nature of the Vandians.

Economy: The economic framework of Dalmavand is
robust, with key industries including agriculture,
timber, and trade. The fertile lands in the southern
regions, particularly the Verdant Expanse, produce
abundant agricultural products, making the area a
vital trade partner. Timber from the forests,
although a point of contention with the elves, is also
a significant part of the economy. The city of Apix,
with its stone quarries, contributes to the
construction industry. Overall, the economy is
healthy, driven by both traditional trades and the
strategic exploitation of natural resources.

Local Pantheon: In Dalmavand, worship centers
around                                 a mix of Norse and Anglo-Saxon gods. Odin,
Thor, Loki, and Eostre are revered for their wisdom,
strength, trickery, and rejuvenation. Freyr and Freyja
hold significant roles, symbolizing fertility and love.

Freyr is particularly esteemed for bringing
elementalism                           to Dalmavand's early inhabitants,
while Freyja governs The Vaytir, the Elemental
Circles integral to the region's spiritual practices.

Local Authorities: The kingdom of Dalmavand is
ruled                                 by King Bastien Vand, who presides from the
capital city, Dalma. The governance structure is
feudal, with local lords overseeing various regions
under the king’s command. The city of Apix, led by
the high priest of Baldur, Nikolaz Velbri, enjoys a
certain degree of autonomy. Law and order are
maintained through a combination of feudal
obligations and the influence of the regional
pantheon, with religious leaders playing crucial roles
in governance and justice.

Important Entities: Key personalities in Dalmavand
include                          King Bastien Vand and Nikolaz Velbri.

Sylvadran, the powerful spirit of Echoes Forest, and
the                        Cresylvadran elves are also significant. The
Verdant Expanse is home to some of the most potent
elementalists in Ainerêve, guided by the Vaytir. The
Eborian Ape-Men, or Losels, are notable regional
monsters, posing a threat to adventurers and
settlements.

Capital city of Dalma

The kingdom is ruled by King Bastien Vand from
Dalma,                               but the capital has declined from its glory
days and is now a virtual backwater of some 15,000
inhabitants, as many of the kingdom’s subjects have
moved westwards to newer settlements, and the
younger warriors have sought adventure elsewhere.
The tower of Vas keep, located within its city walls,
still holds a vast library of history, runic magic, and
knowledge about the gods and history of the
northern lands prior to and during the cythraul
invasion.

AINERÊVE


The City of Apix

The foundations of Apix were laid down with stone
mined                              from rock quarries of a clan of dwarfs called
the Deljun, who lived in the distant western foothills
of the Sechdraic mountains, and with whom the
Vandians found instant rapport. The gray stone walls
now stand nearly 40 feet high and are about 20 feet
thick at the base, with a single main gatehouse
having an iron gate that is normally shut at night but
unguarded during the day. The city has never been
besieged. The city elders, led by the human high
priest of Baldur, Nikolaz Velbri, rarely consider
supporting an expedition across the treacherous
mountainous areas to the south for fear of
encountering Erborian ape-men.

Eborian Ape-Men (Losels)
Type           (TY): Exceptional
Threat Dice (TD):

Melee: 2d8 (using crude weapons or brute strength)

Natural: 2d6 (claws and teeth)

Ranged: 1d6 (throwing rocks or similar objects)

Arcane: 0 (no innate magical abilities)

Extra Attacks (EA): None

Hit Points (HP): 16 (8/8) [average, medium,
mundane; ×1].

This reftects their tough and resilient nature, being
capable of surviving harsh conditions and combat.

Damage Reduction (PR): +2 to HP (thick hide and
agility).

Saving Throw (ST): d8

Reftecting their cunning and survival instincts.
Battle                       Phase (BP): 6 (d8)

This represents their agility and unpredictability in
combat.

Notes:

The Losels, descendants of the ancient Erborian
Ape-Men,                          have degenerated in intelligence and
physical prowess over the centuries. However, they
are still formidable opponents due to their brute

strength, agility, and survival instincts. Known for
their cruel and cunning nature, they are a threat to
any adventurers or settlements they encounter.

Echoes Forest and the Cresylvadran

The Echoes forest is an ancient enchanted wood,
similar                               but different to the forest of Meath. The elves
who moved there, perhaps drawn to it, awakened a
primal nature spirit, one of the strongest of the dran
(elemental guardian spirits), this one akin to the
gods in power. The spirit of Echoes forest called
himself Sylvadran and named his elven awakeners
the credran, meaning kindred of the spirit. Together
they were named the cresylvadran. Sylvadran gave
each elven leader the powers of identification with a
specific element as part of a covenant stating that
they would protect the dran and others of his kind
from any future harm.

Wristhrelin, the elf named king, was made one with
the                              wind and could hear the thoughts of all sentient
creatures upon the currents of the air. His daughter,
Verity, was attuned to the plants and the earth and
could hear the beating heart of every woodland
creature. Aldrin was the essence of fire, symbolizing
the strength of their blood oath to protect the forest.
Caidean was the element of the night, ashen in hue
and wielding the gilded ebony blade, who bore the
verdict of death for those who would harm the dran
or the forest. Arzhela, the elf named queen, was sent
to teach other shee the difficult practices and
knowledge of the credran.

The Woodshades. Prince Mathin the Gray was the
sixth                                of the original credran of Echoes forest. He
made a pact with an evil fiend called Lord Savinoth, a
demon of a realm of shadow. The pact transformed
Mathin and eleven other credran elves who followed
him into dark elves with powers related to shadow
and night.

The Verdant Expanse

Following the Cythraul invasion, some Vandians,
descendants                              of the Varangian Guard, sought a
peaceful life farther south. The Verdant Expanse,
north of Sechdraic Valley and on the western side of
the Sechdraic Valley Mountains, offers a temperate
land with lush pastures. Though part of Dalmavand,
the Expanse enjoys autonomy, especially in religious
matters, and is often sought by their northern
Vandian kin for wisdom and counsel. It has become a
key trade partner due to its agricultural abundance.

The Verdant Expanse is also renowned for its
powerful                       Elementalists. The deities Freyr and Freyja
preside over the region; Freyr, the Norse god of
fertility, prosperity, and peace, declared the first
settlers as keepers of elemental secrets. He decreed
leadership to fall within four houses, or “circles,”
overseen by Freyja, the goddess of love, beauty,
fertility, war, and the magic known as seiðr.

These elemental circles, collectively known as The
Vaytir,                               serve both religious and practical roles in the
region. The Earth Guardians (Jordvard) focus on
agriculture, the Water Wise (Vatnwise) on healing
and purification, the Windrunes (Vindrun) on air and
communication, and the Fire Bards (Eldaskalds) as
keepers of lore and masters of fire.

The people of the Verdant Expanse hold festivals
and                              rituals to honor Freyr and Freyja, often aligned
with seasonal changes and agricultural cycles. The
Vandian temples and shrines in the Verdant Expanse
are dedicated to both deities, and four such places
stand out as unique schools of elementalism. These
schools are central to both the spiritual and everyday
lives of the people, blending the divine and the
practical in their stewardship of the land.The

practical life in the region, focus on various aspects
of elementalism such as agriculture, healing,
environmental protection, and the preservation of
lore.

Castle Astalch

Far north in the colder regions of Dalmavand lies
Astalch                            Castle, which was once a military stronghold
for one of the kings in the north. Today, it’s a ruin.

Only two of Astalch’s five towers still stand, and they
may not stand long, as one leans and the other
sprouts bushes. The other three lie, like the splayed
limbs of a dead man, across the moat and
surrounding field. Climbing through the dry moat
over the old towers’ stones is the only easy access to
the castle now since the drawbridge rotted through
and collapsed long ago.

The forest, once cleared from around the castle so
that                              guards could see anyone who tried to approach,
has grown closer. It is not yet so close that a tree cut
or pulled down would bridge the moat, but trying to
make the castle usable again would involve clearing a
lot of land. Astalch is one of many abandoned castles
dotting the landscape (there is no need now for the
vast number of castles the land supported in its
past), but few of them come with difficulties as great.

The nearest villages are over four days’ travel from
the                            castle. All the inhabitants of those villages know
intimately the legends of what lives there: white-

317


AINERÊVE


faced creatures, like but not like the shee, who
torture                                and devour any they catch. Inhabitants of
every surrounding village know not to travel more
than a half-day toward Astalch Castle because that is
entering their territory. After the war that saw the
founding of the Black Standard and the first pact
with Maedeon’s shee, most cythraul were forced
back into the sea, from where they have not since
emerged. But not all fled. Here, a cell of cythraul
infiltrated and infected Astalch Castle, turning it into
a home for their hate and hungers. They have lived
there for many generations.

Population: Sparse. Not only are there no villages
nearby,                            there are no woodsmen or hermits in the
woods, fields, or hills surrounding the castle. Only a
few animals (few enough for the scarcity to look
strange to an experienced outdoorsman) and the
monstrous cythraul live here.

Economy: There is no economy since nobody lives
here,                              but there is a great deal of arable land and old-
growth and wood not being used for anything here.
The hills even contain decent quantities of copper,
tin, and iron. Reclaiming this land could make
anyone who managed to secure that claim fairly
wealthy.

Important Entities: The only important entities here
are                              the monsters, with one disturbing exception, the
Womb of Cythraul…

Local Authorities: None. Anyone who could have
kept                              the peace has been chased down, tortured, and
devoured.

Relics and Treasures: As the place is an ancient,
abandoned castle, there are plenty of interesting
treasures to be found.

The Library of Astalch: Located within the confines
of                              Castle Astalch, this library remains an invaluable
trove of forgotten lore and knowledge. Castle Astalch
itself was once a modestly fortified structure, far
from a grandiose palace or imposing fortress. Yet, it
was notable as the abode of renowned historians of

the Eldritch Realms, whose contributions have now
largely                               faded from memory. The library, known for
its extensive collection, has become inaccessible due
to a collapsed stairway that once led to its only
entrance, preserving the integrity of its contents.The
collection within the library, comprising volumes of
significant historical and monetary value, remains
remarkably intact. This preservation is not
coincidental. The cythraul, despite their inherently
destructive nature, recognize the potential these
texts hold for strategic advantage. They anticipate
that future captives could decipher them, extracting
information the cythraul could then exploit. To
historians and collectors in the Eldritch Realms, any
book from the Library of Astalch is highly coveted,
offering insights into forgotten histories and
commanding a high price. The challenge of accessing
the library, compounded by the threat of the cythraul
and the treacherous state of the castle, only adds to
the allure and value of these books, making them
prized possessions for those bold enough to seek
them.

Gavin’s Horn: This is a bone horn, probably taken
from                               an enormous mountain goat, and banded in
bronze. Various druidic runes of knowledge, wisdom
and enlightened communication mark its length.

Though the legend is long lost, Gavin, son of Fercos,
once                             stood on a near hill and watched over a decisive
battle. When he knew it was lost, he blew his horn to
tell the women and children to flee. How it ended up
in Astalch Castle is a mystery. This horn, if blown,
can be heard over great distances. Anyone the
hornblower considers an ally can hear the horn,
regardless of distance, and understands its meaning:
victory, defeat, mourning, et cetera. It cannot carry
messages more elaborate than that.

Honest Scale: This plain brass scale is the height of a
short man and stockily built. It has a magical defense
that must be unwoven before the scale can be
harmed in any way physically. This is separate from
its core enchantment, which is to describe perfectly

318


the balance between any two things, physical or
metaphysical. The honest scale can be used for mere
weight and is never wrong, but the person using the
scale can state what quality it is to weigh. The honest
scale then compares the relative values of that
quality in any two things set upon its yard-wide
scale plates. This could be the monetary,
philosophic, historic, or military value of most
items, or even the morality, cruelty, or worth of
people. The scale is always as right as it can be —
some things are governed by chance, and it does not
predict the future.

Astalch Keystone: In the days that saw Astalch Castle
raised,                                  it was common for wizards to enchant the
foundations of major constructions. The keystone of
Astalch was so enchanted, and it retains that magic.
Someone trying to repair Astalch Castle will benefit
from it: the work crews will work faster, tire more
slowly, have fewer accidents, and ask for less pay. All
in all, the repair would take about 25% less time than
usual. Removing the keystone from the castle to use
in the foundation of another building would give the
same benefits to that project.

Vendors and Dealers: Surprisingly, there is one, but
he’s                                not the friendly neighborhood grocer, or even
the sleazy skinflint visiting merchant. He’s
something else. Old Eryi looks like a weak and weary
old man. He is hunched over, with a roughly trimmed
beard, and the clothes he wears have been cobbled
together from a half-dozen different shirts and
pants. The trader speaks haltingly as if he were
always taking a moment to search for a better word
or any word at all. He never looks directly at those he
talks to, instead gazing just over their right
shoulders. He can always be found standing
southeast of Astalch Castle, at the end of one of the
fallen towers. Old Eryi never appears to sit, lie down,
or sleep, and anyone dealing with him is never
attacked by the cythraul.

Concealed among the tumbled stones are what he
has                               to trade: many of the minor treasures of Astalch

Castle, from small gems and pieces of jewelry to age-
old                              cutlery and the ancient Astalch crest from above
the hearth. He’s perfectly willing to take all forms of
minted currency, raw precious metals, or other
valuables. Eryi puts especial value on books, and a
trader braving the forest to bring him current
written materials could make a killing. The trader is
only part Eryi at this point. He is half-merged with a
cythraul, and he trades for precious metals because
the cythraul can use them to spread. He values
written materials because they help the cythraul
learn about the world around them. If someone kills
Eryi, the body slowly turns into a cythraul after about
an hour. It will then rise, the guise destroyed. There
may be a way for heroes to purge Eryi of the cythraul
within him, at the GM’s option, but it should be
difficult.

Adventure Hooks

Astalch Castle is, itself, a giant adventure hook. Still,
there                             are a couple of ways for players’ characters to
treat it.

Raid-style: Get in, get stuff, get out. This is the
classic                            dungeon delve, where the heroes know that
there are both monsters and treasure and they’re
determined to fight the first and take out the second.

Quest-style: This time, they have to accomplish a
specific                              task while they’re in the castle. For Astalch,
that probably means cleaning out the nest of
cythraul who want to eat them. Wiping the blight
from the land can’t be anything but good, and there
is potentially more long-term wealth involved if they
can claim the castle as their own.

Campaign-style: Here, the game focuses on the
threat                               the castle presents for more than a few
sessions. That threat probably looms over the rest of
the land, as the cythraul are just now beginning to
explore the world outside their castle. Those small
villages have probably been destroyed, and the
plague of fiends is spreading. After building up to an
assault on the castle over several sessions, the

319


AINERÊVE


heroes go in to stop the cythraul and save the world
or                              die trying. All the treasure from the previous two
options is there, but the characters can also become
nationwide.

The Womb of Cythraul inserted here from your e-
mail.                                I don’t understand “Psychic Influence” or how
the extra attacks work in this context.

Womb of Cythraul
Type: Extraordinary

Threat Rank: 3d20 Psychic Influence (any sub-
effect), or 5d10 bite (see notes) on contact:

Extra Attacks: 1. 2d10 Psychic harm, 2. 2d10 Psychic
harm,                                3. 6d10 Afflict: Stun.

Hit Points: 240 [normal, tiny*, supernatural; ×4]

*size not counted in the womb’s HP multiplier.

Damage Reduction: None

Saving Throw: Any strike bringing HP below zero
must                             beat an item save vs 3d10or all harm from that
strike is forfeit.

Battle Phase 1 (no agility die), mind only. The womb

does not move unless carried.

Items: No treasure, unless the womb is valued as a
gem… but it may be an unfortunate prize to bring to
the jeweler.

Notes: Whether the cythraul who settled here
brought                                  it with them or somehow constructed it over
the several centuries they’ve had here, this allows
them to live comfortably within Astalch Castle and
grow in number. It sits in one of the central lower
chambers of the castle, resting on the floor and
filling the room with an ivory light. Cythraul avoid it,
even to the point of refusing to chase fleeing heroes
into that chamber. It appears to be a cut crystal about
the size of a woman’s palm. The catch is that it looks
like treasure, and the players’ characters are just the
sort to bring it out of the castle. And when they do,
cythraul and death will follow.

The womb is intelligent. It can communicate
telepathically                             with anyone caught within its pale
light. It is also a master of reading others and
deceiving them. The womb never communicates with
someone unless this will be advantageous, and then
it fabricates some story to manipulate its victim into
obeying it.

One example: It might claim to be the spirit of an
ancient                             princess locked in a gemstone and then
describe a ritual to “free the spirit” that would birth
hundreds of new cythraul. The womb can make
direct mental contact with any cythraul within one
mile, knowing their thoughts and memories, seeing
through their eyes, and commanding them.

Cythraul almost always obeys the mental directions
of                               the cythraul womb. It can create new cythraul by
consuming the mind of one human or the flesh of
five or by consuming five pounds of pure precious
metal. The material being consumed disappears over
about a day; consuming a human mind is entirely
mental and more complex.

The womb can perform any Mystic feat with no
chance                              of error and can summon, control, and heal
(or destroy) cythraul. The womb can bite with a
razor-sharp mouth that is invisible but soon
discovered by any creature that touches its
crystalline form with exposed flesh.

The Cythraul

The cythraul are humanoids who hate all human life.
Vaguely human in shape, these monsters are always
pale white and malformed in numerous ways that
mark their ranks or types. They are truly creatures
out of a nightmare, looking vaguely human but with
elongated features and some entirely alien aspect.

They are barbaric and insane by human standards,
but                            not stupid, and only the simplest will attack
without considering acquiring an advantage or
killing without thinking about taking a prisoner.

Cythraul have a limited hive mind. At times,
individual                       cythraul “check in” to the communal
mind. At that moment, the cythraul has the
perspective and memory of the entire race, and it
updates the hive memory with the individual’s
experiences since the last communion.

Though cythraul can stray from the hive’s goals
over                              time, they naturally check in every week or two,
reinforcing an individual’s communal
responsibilities and setting it back on course. Thus, a
straying cythraul would have to subconsciously
subdue its natural urge to connect with the hive,

320


which gets harder over time. Some specific aspect of
the cythraul’s inhuman features marks them as
belonging to a certain caste, determining rough
pecking orders and responsibilities.

The cythraul womb described above can change a
cythraul from one caste to another and even devise
new castes for specific purposes. The cythraul in
question must spend a half-hour stationary in the
womb’s glow to complete the transition. Three
sample castes follow, though there are certainly
more.

Aniathraul

Type: Extraordinary (humanoid)

Threat Rank: Arcane 3d12 (Harm) ~ Melee 2d8 ~
Natural 2d6 ~Ranged 2d4

Extra Attacks: 1. 3d12 Malediction –3, 2. 3d12 Afflict-
Stun

Hit Points: 108 (81/27) [fast, medium, magical; ×1.5]

Damage Reduction: Non
Saving Throw: 3d10
Battle Phase: d10

Note: Aniathraul have no eyes, possessing only deep
black voids where the ocular cavities should be.

Further, their fingers are about twice as long as a
normal                           human’s, with an extra set of joints. They are
very dexterous, and they can create strange, razor-
sharp ivory needles and scalpels out of their own
flesh instantly without apparent pain. The aniathraul
are the wizards and mad doctors of the cythraul.

They wield terrifying magic completely foreign to
druids,                              and it is they who change human captives
into tortured weapons, tools, and playthings. These
horrid monsters have extra attacks, even occurring
in the very same phase as the primary attack, capable
of turning foes into… just about anything.

The first extra attack is always a malediction effect
(modify                           ability; NN 6; –3 to ability), manifesting as a
force that warps some facet of the target’s physical
body, reducing ability checks in one of the following:
Agility, Fortitude, Melee Weapons, Perception,
Ranged Weapons, Unarmed Combat, Willpower. The
second extra attack can transmute the target into
something else, even an ordinary object (e.g.,
temporarily changed or part-changed into a cabbage

or cauldron or candle). This is of the Thaumaturgy
path,                           and its effect is Affliction, Stun (NN 12, see
Chapter 4, Afflictions).

Not sure what this translates to exactly. Maybe
could                              define as spells? Perhaps affect one of the three
basic abilities or the 9 specialties or both.

Items: These monsters can conjure almost any sort
of                          equipment needed. The brain of an aniathraul, if
pulverized and eaten, adds 2d12 to Willpower DP for
one week. Most mortals cannot stomach such a feat,
and the very attempt causes 12 points of damage
directly to Fortitude, causing unconsciousness for
one day per point exceeding that score. Once awake,
the user can evoke psychogenic powers mirroring
any standard magical effects.

Draigthraul

Type: Extraordinary (humanoid)

Threat Rank: 3d10 Natural* ~ 3d10 Melee (flail
mastery) ~ Ranged 2d10 ~ Arcane 2d6

Extra Attacks: 1. 2d20 Melee, 2. d20 Melee

Hit Points: 138 (34/104) [tough, large, magical; ×1.5]

Damage Reduction: By armor, plus another d4
(natural toughness)

Saving Throw: 3d10 versus mental afflictions, else
2d10

Battle Phase: d16

Note: Draigthraul are taller by a foot than the
average                             cythraul, with more massive bodies and very
evident, very white fangs. They are immensely
strong and skilled at unarmed combat (their natural
way of fighting) and combat with all sorts of
weapons. When a draigthraul chooses to run, it can
match a horse for speed. Draigthraul are one of the
many cythraul war castes, effectively designed to
battle and kill living creatures of all kinds. By
grabbing and biting a living or recently dead
opponent, the monster can drain some of the
victim’s blood and regain some vitality. Draigthraul
who do this gain a ruddy cast to their white skin until
they have not consumed any blood for at least a day.
The draigthraul are superhumanly strong and quick,
capable of attacking up to three times in a round.

*Special attack: A draigthraul can leech life force
from                              a victim like a vampire but must first grab the
victim. A contest of Unarmed ability between the

321


AINERÊVE


monster and its opponent determines whether the
target                               has been grappled. If the monster wins a
second opposed roll, the grappled opponent is
pinned and unable to evade until he breaks the hold.
The monster can then drain his blood, sucking out
3d10 points of the passive DP, bypassing all active
defense and armor. Use an opposed roll each round
to see if the target breaks free of the hold. Vampirism
can bring a target below zero Fortitude. Whatever
points are drained are added to the draigthraul’s HP,
restoring its health up to its maximum. Note also
that the attacker gets no active defense while
grappling. Also, the draigthraul cannot make extra
melee attacks when grappling.

Items: The draigthraul prefer the flail (+3/+2 harm/
init                           bonus) or the combat axe (+2/+1 harm/init
bonus). It is not unusual to discover one of these
monsters was carrying an item possessing magic
effects or some permanent bonuses to harm or
armor of d4 strength.

Gweithraul

Type: Standard (humanoid)

Threat Rank: 2d8 Unarmed ~ 2d6 Melee ~ 2d4
Ranged ~ d4 Arcane

Hit Points: 80 (40/40) [normal, medium, magical;

×2]

Damage Reduction: d6
Saving Throw: 2d4
Battle Phase: d8

Notes: The gweithraul has an extra forearm and
hand at each elbow. Each forearm has as much

freedom to move as a human’s singleforearm does.
All                                its fingers end in wicked, barbed claws that are as
good for tearing flesh as they are for grasping
objects. Gweithraul are, roughly, the worker caste,
though they are as terrifying in combat as most
cythraul.

The gweithraul possess tough skin, granting them
the                         equivalent of leather armor for d6 points of
protection. In addition,due to their unusually tough
nature, they receive ×2 HP, rather than ×1.5.

Items: The gweithraul are capable of using standard
weapons,but usually have no need, given their many,
scary appendages.Their hide is useful in creating
armor, and when incorporated into armor or shields
it grants a +1 bonus to either.

The Northern
Reaches

The Northern Reaches, a rugged land across the sea
north of Dalmavand and the Forest of Meath, boasts
stunning mountain vistas and dense pine forests.

The rugged landscape requires its residents to be
resilient, as severe winters can swiftly eliminate
those who are not prepared.

This territory is home to three human clans and,
initially, three dwarven clans. The destruction of
Forka's impressive dwarven temple by a volcanic
eruption forced the fusion of the dwarves with the

322


humans. The situation deteriorated further with the
opening of a chasm, which released subterranean
creatures and ravaged the few remaining dwarven
settlements.

The Wolf Clan, the most amiable and open to new
beliefs,                              joined forces with the dwarves to build
strong defenses against the emerging terrors of the
chasm, now ominously called the "Gate of Many
Eyes." The formidable Bear Clan stays neutral in
many disputes and frequently acts as hired soldiers.
The ambitious Boar Clan is infamous for conducting
raids and engaging in piracy, often targeting
vulnerable communities along the northern coast of
Maedoen.

The Dur Clan, formerly famous for their
exceptional                        craftsmanship and sculpting, are known
for their strong work ethic. The Kur Clan, former
elite warriors, blend the ferocity of barbarian
berserkers with the honor of knights. The Mur Clan,
celebrated brewers, are famous for their potent ale
and legendary detoxifying abilities.

A large number of dwarves continue to follow the
faith                                of Forka, the dwarven patriarch, although a few
have embraced Sol instead. Forka's followers,
marked by a golden hammer over a gray mountain
against a purple sky, are protectors of their kin.

The devastating collapse of Forka Mountain
happened                                due to dwarves digging excessively deep
out of greed, resulting in catastrophic destruction
and the emergence of monstrous hordes. The once
grand temple is now a ruin, partly occupied by vile
creatures. Nevertheless, numerous courageous
individuals explore this place in search of riches and
sacred relics infused with the essence of Forka. In the
absence of their magnificent temple, the priests of
Forka uphold the faith by tending to many shrines
throughout the northern reaches, ensuring that the
traditions and history endure amid the vestiges of
their former splendor.In religion, many dwarves still
adhere to the worship of Forka, the dwarven father,
despite some converting to Sol. Forka's followers,
marked by a golden hammer over a gray mountain

323

against a purple sky, are protectors of their kin,
always                          equipped with warhammers, shields, and
heavy armor. The ale horn symbolizes their faith.

The catastrophic collapse of Forka Mountain, now
Zorka                               ("the fall of the dwarven folk"), occurred
when greed drove the dwarves to dig too deep,
unleashing fiery destruction and monstrous hordes
from the caves of shadows. The once grand temple,
capable of housing thousands, is now a ruin, partly
occupied by vile creatures. Yet, many brave souls
venture here, seeking the treasures and holy relics of
a bygone era, items imbued with Forka's essence,
beyond mere magic.

Now without their grand temple, Forka's priests
maintain                          numerous shrines across the northern
reaches, keeping faith and history alive amidst the
remnants of their lost glory.

Forest of Meath

At first, Meath’s vast and lush forest seems normal,
with                            sunny and shaded stretches, hills and dales,
waterways, light woods, thickets, and clearings. It is
home to beautiful open valleys, hundreds of square
miles of pristine woodland, and countless secret,
verdant dells that hide earthly and esoteric secrets.
At the edges, it is fairly natural, but it is an
enchanted forest and the abode of the shee.

These changeable forest denizens fit the traditional
beliefs                             they are shaped by, with most valuing
cleverness and courtesy and despising boorishness
and greed, regardless of whether they are cruel or
kind, grim or playful. The most powerful and stern of
the shee rulers treat Maedoen as a plaything and
mingle with its royal bloodlines. Also hidden in the
glens of Meath are the angels (celestials or peris) and
devils (demons or deevs) that the inhabitants of
Psarmorum revere or revile.

This juxtaposition of beliefs is more than a simple
accident                              of fate. The first tree of Meath sprouted with
the beginning of the Celtic religion in the region on


AINERÊVE


Earth that would become Wales. As this belief
commingled                             with the superstitions of the Celtic
people, the land around the first sapling grew more
fertile, and the tree's seeds took hold. The strength
of the belief and the widespread nature of the Celtic
religion gave the young Meath enough energy to
grow. In its youth, the forest was a dark place filled
with gnomes and goblins, full of mischief and
danger; but strong, ruled over by the one druidic sun
god.

When the Romans conquered the Celts and later
forced                           religious integration, the obvious parallel
with the Christian God meant that the new beliefs of
the Romans were quickly adopted. The changes in
religion changed Meath. Mischievous but largely
unaligned fay creatures waned in number, displaced
by demons, imps, and so on. They served or opposed
the distant but powerful God.

After the decline of the Roman Empire, the Celtic
Christian                            church had its core in Ireland and Wales. It
was then, before the faith began to spread again, that
Meath's mischievous fairy creatures became more
like the fay of those countries and recovered their
numbers. By this point, the Forest of Meath was a
vast, sprawling, primeval woodland filled with
strange creatures and bizarre natural magic.

That was the last major influx of belief and
imagination                              the forest received from Earth, although
a steady trickle of fairy lore has added to it gradually
since, helping to leaven and lighten the place
somewhat.

This mix of various beliefs made it a conceptual
destination                        both for the Welsh of the time and the
later (mainly) Christian Knights Templar. Thus, it
became a bridge between the two worlds.

Baphomet’s adoption of the sun god persona, Sol
Invictus                         (supposedly as Ainerêve’s name for God, but
in fact from a Roman cult) took advantage of
underlying beliefs to twist Meath’s Celtic
Christianity to his own religion.

There is constant skirmishing going on in some
areas of the forest. The angels (peris in service to

Baphomet) and demons (those opposed to
Baphomet)                               clash here in Meath as in Psarmorum but
are united in their dislike of the shee. The two
battling realms are likely to encroach upon the
portions of the forest inhabited by the fairy creatures
to fight each other and sometimes make (very) brief
alliances against them since the shee are numerous.
The shee fight back obliquely. Many are content to
evade the assaults of the celestial and demonic
beings, playing tricks in return and spreading
mischief in their ranks. Others war directly, raising
legions of their own, hundreds of strange and unique
creatures who tangle with the demons and angels,
killing some and sometimes dying themselves. No
matter how many die on both sides, there always
seem to be more.

Besides the war that mirrors that of Psarmorum
and                            Maedoen, there is an incidental effect of the
intermingling in the Forest of Meath. As time passes,
the occasional angel or demon may find the shee not
so despicable after all and become more interested in
experiencing life in Meath. Likewise, the occasional
shee may learn to take pleasure in angels’ or
demons’ company and practices. Their natures may
gradually change through such associations. There
are always more pure shee, angels, and demons, but
the number of creatures with two species’ traits
slowly grows.

Local Pantheon: The shee and like fay creatures
mostly                             worship Bel (Belenus, in his aspect as the god
of sun and fire). Various demons (also known as
devils or deevs) worship the Devil, Prince of
Darkness and Father of Lies. Resident humans and
half-humans may worship Sol Invictus (not known
by them to be Baphomet), or Maedoen gods such as
Cernunnos. The angels that are peris serve Sol, for
now. Rarely, genuine angels from various faiths may
appear to aid the truly good and oppose the truly evil.

Population: Sparse. Meath has no dearth of natural
and                        supernatural creatures. Still, it’s so vast in scope
and changeable in nature that even a master
woodsman might sometimes have difficulty finding

324


a sentient inhabitant — assuming one was not
looking                            for him as well. There are human hamlets
near the forest edge, but the camps, courts, and
other domiciles of the shee and so on are often
magically hidden (see Appendix A).

The Shee: The creatures of faerie rule the forest; the
elves,                              fairies, and many others. As a general rule, the
shee is practiced at the magic of glamor, making the
false appear real, the real look false, and can
accomplish myriad effects. Shee generally feed off
emotions or feelings from humans they meet, and
thus they play inventive and often dangerous games
with them. On the rare occasions that the shee make
mortal heroes welcome, they can be charming hosts,
fêting them with wondrous food, drink, music, and
stories. The shee will seldom refuse a contest and are
especially fond of fighting and chess, at which they
are skilled enough that many mortals have lost all
they owned in a match. In their places of power, the
fay folk can often exceed the normal bounds of
magic. For instance, even minor sprites and so on
can cast cantrips that affect ordinary mortals. While
demi-human heroes will be called “cousins” as a
courtesy, they get no special favors.

Economy: Despite the war between Maedoen and
Psarmorum, some merchants from either place and
some from Dalmavand (too brave or too foolish, as
their contemporaries say) dare travel between
nations. They take the sole long safe road forged
through Meath and pay heavy tariffs, imposts, levies,
or sometimes short-cut trails, hoping not to run into
one of the frivolously cruel shee or the gleefully cruel
demons who live in the woods. The inhabitants of
Meath levy no tax or toll per se, though some may
sometimes claim unwilling travelers as living
playthings — which serves as a heavy enough toll on
all who would pass through the forest.

There’s almost as much to trade with the forest
residents                               as there is to trade with the humans on the
other side. The fay folk of Meath, benign or malign or
simply capricious, take pleasure in playing with the

less magical humankind. Wit and politeness are oft
the                                best sword and shield for those who deal with
them, and innocent children have been known to
wander scatheless through the woods. Some humans
(usually of Maedoen) enter the forest specifically to
try their luck with the mercurial shee, hoping to
receive a random boon or endure the fairies’ tricks or
tests long enough for their mood to become more
generous. (Many folktales told on both sides of the
forest have the moral that those who enter Meath
seeking gifts are more likely to receive nothing. That
doesn’t stop the occasional adventurer from trying
for even more occasional success.) There is even a
steady trade outside the forest in charms and
enchantments that their barkers claim will make the
fay look upon one favorably.

Others don’t take chances. A fortune hunter who is
daring and silver-tongued enough might forge a deal
with the shee. (If the stories are to be believed, a
promise or bargain made by the fair folk is
impossible for them to break.) Most typically, a
human volunteers to undergo a quest (or to be the
butt of the shee’s jokes, pranks, and other
mischiefs), and after success (or a set time), the fairy
gives him or her a moderate boon, often in the form
that folktales describe (since that is what people
expect).

Less moral individuals may trade others for their
boons.                           Whether they provide indentured servants,
men trying to alleviate debts or liens, or slaves
(illegal in either human nation), the entrepreneur
can earn significant benefits from certain shee (if
they are what they seem). Shee are not the only
forest inhabitants who indulge in bargaining with
the human folk who come by. The most powerful
creatures and gods of the forest (of which Bel is one)
are often willing to accept sacrifices in exchange for
potential benefits. Demons in the east do much like
the shee in the west, tormenting travelers they find
in Meath and eagerly dealing with them for souls or
tempting their victims into sin.

325


AINERÊVE


Within the forest itself, its inhabitants engage in
myriad different forms of exchange. Some trade in
the comprehendible medium of enchanted silver or
fairy gold, but many others incur and pay debts by
performing songs, teaching rhymes, with bits of
seeds, worthless crystals, or even by being
inhospitable or wittily rude to another. Only the
sharpest travelers manage to break even trading in
Meath.

Noteworthy Places

Coille Creige (The Wood of the Rock): A fertile glen
in                            Meath Forest, gateway to the Otherworld.

Skybound Crosmallite crystals grow from earth to
treetops,                              defying gravity. Caelmorin, an ancient Shee
Reifium born from an oak, rules this Volitional
Realm. The Wyld Elves harvest crystals through
rituals preserving the glen's balance. The Mi-
Dhaonna clan, Aesir Valley dwarf descendants, mine
Earthbound Crosmallite. Their uneasy alliance with
the elves enables powerful artifact creation, vital for
both clans' survival.

Dubhthach: A town in Meath Forest's shadows,
influenced                            by Unseelie power. Winding streets and
old structures blend with gnarled roots and twisted
branches. Magic permeates the air. Dubhthach
connects the mortal world to Meath's enigmatic
inhabitants, its people adept at fae court politics.

Gleamsward: Oberon's realm in Meath Forest.
Elemental                            and mystical forces shape glittering
meadows and enchanted groves that shift with the
Seelie King's moods. Oberon, often aloof, balances
magical factions and protects his subjects. Ancient
trees display rune carvings, chronicling Oberon's
spells and decrees.

Ljosalfheimr: An otherworldly section of Meath
Forest                              in perpetual twilight. The air sparkles with
living light, and plants and animals display
unearthly colors. Light elves dwell here, known for
their craftsmanship and nature connection. The
forest's inner music guides the pure-hearted and
confuses the malicious.

Solas Glade: Ljosalfheimr's radiant heart, sacred to
light elves. The glade glows with earth-born light,
encircled by iridescent trees. Luminous plants react
to visitors, forming intricate light patterns. Some
claim to glimpse past and future here, making it a
place of prophecy and reflection.

The Safe Road: A 30-foot-wide packed earth road
through                            Meath Forest, with 30 feet of cleared land on
each side. It runs from Psarmorum to Maedoen. A
powerful spell agreed upon by all factions, including
the shee, governs it. Forest magic doesn't work here,
and combat is forbidden unless mutually agreed.

Unauthorized attacks move as if through syrup.

326


Stepping off the road removes all protection,
tempting                 travelers with risk.

Thornveil: Mab's domain, is a realm of contrasts
where                              beauty and danger intertwine. Mab, once a
member of the Seelie Court, now wields Unseelie
magic, creating a landscape that shifts between
alluring meadows and treacherous bogs. Ancient
standing stones in Thornveil Wood bear witness to
forgotten rites, their surfaces etched with cryptic
runes. At the heart of the wood stands Mab's arboreal
palace, a nexus of fae politics where Seelie and
Unseelie influences converge.

Strange Properties of Meath

The realms of faerie can be cruel or enchanting or
whimsical, but are always changeable. Meath is no
exception. It has few stable landmarks. Apart from
strange encounters, it has effects of its own that
generally result in a traveler becoming hopelessly
lost and perhaps prey to monsters or wicked shee.

For each half-day of travel off the safe road, roll a
d12:

Glamor. Mysticism subtly changes landmarks and
features as one goes. Travel is hard going save for
certain paths, which vanish after a time, and only
lead deeper in.

Change. As for glamor, above, but changes are real.
Trees                             move to block routes etc.

Travel rate. Seems normal but is at d6: 1 tenth, 2
fifth,                                 3 half, 4 twice, 5 five times, 6 ten times normal.
Distance. The actual distance between places varies

as for the rate above.

Direction. Travel is in a random direction (d8 for
compass heading: N, NE, E, etc.), but sun, moon,
stars, and direction sense all indicate travelers are
heading the way they think they are going.

Plain lost. No idea which way is which, end up
traveling in circles.

7–12.No effect.

Effects last the day (or night). Magic can counter
some                                 of them (GM’s call) but will attract magic-
using denizens of the forest. Some paths are deer
trails and a series of loosely-linked bridle paths that
the shee have woven through the forest for their own
use, but these are very hard to find and not stable,
keeping to the same general route for only a few
days. The bridle paths are not magical per se, but the
shee are bound by their laws not to molest any who
remain thereon. The Guardians’ Guild of Crossroads
has worked out how to find and follow such paths to
travel to the desired location, most of the time (5 in
6), with only brief treks through the more dangerous
forest itself.

The Waters: Reflecting the fluidity of faerie, water is
often magical in Meath. Streams and pools in the
forest (off-road or path) will be clear and refreshing
unless polluted by some fell beast or other, but have
a 1 in 6 chance of being enchanted when drunk from
(and an hour after).

Roll a d6 to see what happens if the waters are
magical:

Sleep. Fall into a deep slumber after a few rounds.

Memory loss. Who are we? Why are we here? Where
is                              here anyway?

Confusion. Lose sense of direction; no idea how to
find one’s way.

Tranquility. Perfectly at peace; want to lie back, eat
lotuses, etc.

As a beneficent potion. Whatever the character
seems                          to need most.

Touch of faerie glamor. The next encounter
reaction                     will be positive.

Effects last the day (or night), as for forest magic.
Meath                            water in a waterskin varies with its source
while in Meath (i.e., 1 in 6 magical if an hour or more
has passed).

Regional Creatures

The shee are the best example of the local fauna.
They                               are hard to categorize, but the most commonly
encountered are the Shee, the Elves (who are
considered the Lords of the Shee), and the Imps.

Fertile Glens

Description: Fertile glens are typically one of the
many                               small valleys in the Forest of Meath. The
canopy is no less thick above it, and it is no less
verdant, but there is typically a single easy path in at
one end of the glen that threads the valley to the
other side, where it stops, usually at the bottom of a
cliff. These glens are fertile not just in plants but also
in magic. Fertile glens serve as homes to the many
strange shee creatures that live in Meath. A glen
often houses a small fairy court of some kind, with
one powerful creature presiding over the rest. All of
them typically play at some form of internecine
politics, allying and backstabbing to their hearts’
delight. If they have hearts, that is. A glen is not
always a valley, although that is the most common: it
could be a clearing, a small lake, a hollow hill (rath),
and so on. The only true requirement is that the glen
has one way in and out. Most are fairly idyllic places
since most fay like it that way.

Many fertile glens have unique properties. One
might                               cause those who die there to live on in its
memory; another could turn silver that crosses its
boundaries into gold. Most glens cause some
measure of local time distortion. Common legends
talk of visitors spending a day but returning after a
minute and vice versa. Usually, the distortion is less.
Only the most powerful fairy lords rule glens that
have great effects on time. Each glen has its own
unique name that describes and defines it to
inhabitants and potential visitors. Some fertile glens,
like many of the fay creatures they house, also have
secret names. One who knows that secret name has
power over the glen, including the power to seal it
away from the rest of Meath and alter its appearance

and nature. Ways to discover a secret name are
intrinsic                             to the place — perhaps a specific rite
performed at the glen’s heart, or reading tea leaves
under a specific moon, might reveal it.

Usually, only the single strongest shee in a fertile
glen                              knows the glen’s secret name (if any), though
other strong shee may know it as well. It is not
uncommon for a shee lord, not tied down to any glen
or fairy court, to know many glens’ names and use
them as leverage for safe travel. It is the more
strange and magical glens that have secret names,
and the most powerful actually have two — such
glens are intelligent entities in their own right and
dangerous to cross. Glens’ second secret names can
be revealed against the entities’ wills, but the rituals
to learn them are known only to the sagest of
theurgists.

Glens can actually be “killed,” though the methods
for                             slaying them are unique to each glen. Planting a
mistletoe twig in one might destroy it while stealing
three of the place’s seven gem-laden idols might
slay another. Killing a glen eliminates one of its
secret names. If a conscious glen loses its second and
more secret name, it becomes little more than a
fertile glen of special ability. Killing a glen with only
a single secret name is less like murder and more like
disabling or breaking a potent weapon or tool. A glen
with no secret names is just a magical place and
cannot be further harmed in this way.

Demons and angels (peris) also use fertile glens for
their                             domiciles in Meath. Some learn the secret name
of a glen and may try to change it into something
that suits them. Such changes are more than
decorative, so it takes time for a fertile glen to don a
diabolic or paradisiac aspect. Where the change is
complete, an unsuspecting traveler in Meath can
step from verdant forest to hellfire-burned
wasteland (or harp-strewn cloudscape) in the space
of a minute’s walk — and it can often be harder to
leave than to enter.

328


The following table and suggestions are provided to
help GMs characterize the large numbers of fertile
glens in Meath. Roll 1d12 for a starting point on what
glens can be like, but the possibilities are endless.

A d6 would serve for the 6 options you chose (it was
1–2, 3–4 etc.) but I suggest letting a 7–12 be the
other possibilities, as below.

1.Animals can talk.

2.Plants can talk.

3.Plants and talk and move

4.Directions reversed. Must walk backward to go
forwards, left to move right, etc.

5.Magic is erratic: half the time, spells have
punning and/or amusing results.

6.Objects can d6: 1–4 talk, 5–6 talk, and move. On a
6, it includes sun, moon, and stars.

7–12. Choose from the following options or make
up                            something suitable. Time seems normal but
passes in the glen at d6: 1 thirtieth, 2 tenth, 3 third, 4
thrice, 5 ten times, 6 thirty times outside rate. Travel
takes d6: 1 five, 2 ten, 3 fifty, 4 100, 5 200, 6 500
times longer to cover the ground (a field might seem
a plain, a hill a mountain), but returning is at normal
rates. Shrink. All creatures (and gear) entering the
glen are shrunk to miniature size, so normal-sized
glen and plants seem enormous (common for
important fay courts and settlements). Size. Animals
and plants are d4: 1–2 miniature, 3–4 giant-sized.

Things work as they do in fairy tales: something
politely                             asked for or freely given is good, otherwise it

The Goblin Market

Fay of all kinds, other forest inhabitants, angels and
demons, creatures from other realms, the odd
wizard, and select traders (of which the party is
assumed to be) gather here under truce to wander
through the tents and tables piled high with
stupendous goods and produce. As for the shee
section of the Porreth Bazaar in Grimsete, vendors,
choice, and clientele are wider. Everything is noise,
bustle, color. Rare wines, ambrosial foods, faery
fabrics, marvelous magic, wondrous weapons are all
displayed.

Counsel can also be sought — how best to win a
princess’s hand, how to lift a potent curse. The more
desirable goods and services generally require
elaborate quests as payment to perform deeds or
gain items for the seller. All sorts of people gather

The Town of Dolar

In the northeastern Meath Forest, where it meets the
Drayocht Ocean, sits Dolar, a unique maritime town
with a secret: it exists as a demiplane, willed into
being by its founder, the elven archmage Alen Beirie.
Known for his journeys across Ainerêve and Earth, a
realm unknown to most, Beirie imbued Dolar with
his singular vision.

The town’s name, meaning “currency” in
Meadoen,                             reflects its role as a thriving trade center,
especially for those seeking rare artifacts and
otherworldly crafts. Dolar’s fleet, enhanced with the
same energy that sustains the town, navigates the
treacherous Drayocht Ocean, trading with dwarven
clans in Blackwater and Stormreach.

The town’s aesthetic blends nature with
craftsmanship.                             Many residents, created by Beirie’s
will at the town’s founding, work alongside others
who arrived later, all sharing a love of crafting,
trade, and a communal sense of humor. This is
evident in landmarks like the Dolar Tree and the
lively workshops and taverns filled with laughter and
tales of the sea.

Banríonau

Around a century ago, Ragnar Ironheart, a leader
from                              the northern Kingdom of Dalmavand, was
convinced to lead a conquest of southwestern
Maedoen. This campaign was likely influenced by a
former Maedoen monarch, possibly due to an old
alliance or friendship. Following the conquest,
Ragnar established the kingdom of Banríonau
(pronounced ban-ree-uh-naw). Today, his
descendant, Lady Brynhildr Ironheart, governs this
young realm. Like her forefather, she is revered for
her just and compassionate rule.

Lady Brynhildr, of both Celtic and Nordic lineage,
deeply                       venerates the Celtic deities of the Tuatha Dé

Danann. Under her leadership, Banríonau has
become                               a unique fusion of Tuatha Dé and Norse
traditions. The people of Banríonau, fiercely
independent and family-oriented, take immense
pride in their heritage, renowned for producing
exquisite fabrics, ceramics, and jewelry that reflect
their dual cultural legacy.

Banríonau also boasts a rich bardic tradition, where
skilled                            musicians and performers shine at festivals
and gatherings, keeping the realm’s history and
culture alive through song and story. The landscape
of Banríonau is marked by towering mountains, deep
valleys, and fast-flowing rivers. Its picturesque
farming villages, scattered across the realm, are
home to hardworking residents who diligently tend
their crops and livestock. Over the past century, the
resilient people of Banríonau have weathered wars,
invasions, and natural disasters, forging a strong
and close-knit community.

Important Entities: The Regent’s Elite Guard, led by
a                       battle-hardened knight named Maelgwn Fawr
(MYLE-goon VOW-r), ensures the protection of Lady
Brynhildr. The Bardic Order upholds Banríonau’s
musical and storytelling traditions, vital to the
kingdom’s cultural identity.

Noteworthy Places: Elmsong Woods, home to a
sprite                            glade that transforms from day to night,
revealing powerful magic. The Sunken Ruins of
Gorgon’s Lair, off the coast, shrouded in mystery
and linked to ancient legends. The Arcane Nexus, a
site of potent magical forces, guarded by deadly
wards.

Relics & Treasures: Banríonauian crafts, such as
ornate                            jewelry and tapestries, honor the Celtic
deities, showcasing the region’s rich artistic
heritage. Artifacts that reflect the shared Celtic and
Norse influences of the kingdom, offering a tangible
link to Banríonau’s storied past.

Vendors & Dealers: The bustling markets and docks
of                           Falgardr are central to trade, with importers,
money-lenders, smugglers, and merchants driving
the kingdom’s economy.

Guilds & Training: The Bardic Order not only
preserves                          traditions but also trains new generations
of musicians and storytellers. Mercenary companies
gather in Falgardr’s taverns, recruiting skilled
warriors for various conflicts.

Regional Monsters: The forests and hills are haunted
by                            goblins, hags, and fey creatures, while the coastal
waters near Gorgon’s Lair are home to sea serpents
and the fearsome gorgons, posing threats to those
who venture into these perilous regions.

Adventure Hooks:

Tears of Stone: Brave explorers are needed to plumb
the                             sunken remains rumored to be the lost ship of
the dreaded Weeping Widow—a mournful figure
whose gaze turns all to stone. The petrified forms of
her crew linger in the murky gloom, alongside
priceless treasures entombed within. Those who dare
to face the Widow’s curse may claim the relics
hidden in her watery grave.

The Nexus Unbound: An Arcane Nexus, a source of
immense magical power, has been sensed in the
lands of Banríonau. The air hums with strange
energy, and the scent of ozone carries a hint of
something otherworldly. Seek out this Nexus, a
potential gateway to the sublime Meterea and
unravel its deadly defenses to harness energies
capable of shaping reality itself.

The Fading Curse: The rustic villages under Lady
Brynhildr’s protection face a growing menace—

brutal raids by fearsome Redcaps, their bodies
warped                                by fell fey magic. Whispers abound of Lady
Brynhildr’s hidden connection to ancient lineages,
possibly offering insight into the creatures’ motives.
Heroes are needed to defend the innocent and rescue
captives from their vile clutches.

Treasures of Trade: Perilous roads between
Banríonau                             and distant realms carry caravans laden
with exotic goods like ethereal silks and dreaming-
dust, bound for the Shimmering Market, where
otherworldly wares are traded. Safeguard these
riches against cunning spirit-bandits, chimerical
beasts, and corrupt spiretaxmen, preserving the
lifeblood of Banríonau’s economy.

Relics of the Gloaming: Scattered across the lands
are                            priceless artifacts imbued with the echoes of
forgotten rituals from when the veil between worlds
was thin. Lost tomes of unraveling mysteries,
ancestral heirlooms tied to Tuatha Dé lineages, and
mythic dreamforged weapons await discovery. These
relics hold the key to Banríonau’s storied past,
offering an opportunity to recover echoes of history.

Beings Diverse
and Malign

Two copies of this bestiary exist, both in the town of
Crossroads.                              One is in the shielded reading room
(advanced section) of the spiral tower of the Octocirculi
Academy. The other is in the private vaults of the
Guardians’ Guild. Each bestiary is a large, locked, brass-
bound volume chained to a lectern; access is available on
request (and possibly after payment) to those deemed
suitable, stable, and discreet. The information outlined
is not only not generally known but not safe to know. To
speak of, or even hint at, some of the things revealed is
to invite the attention of the most unwelcome kind.

Caveat lector!

I, Signoret, sage and wizard, pupil of the late Hawklord,
and                            student of the Octocirculi Academy, being by virtue
of personal experience well informed where the more
extraordinary inhabitants of this world are concerned,
have decided to compile a bestiary. In so doing I have
been moved to create as accurate an account as possible
and thus I go beyond my own knowledge and quote
freely from sources I know to be reliable.

Herein are compiled the travelers’ tales of Nathal and
Virgil,                               the wisdom of the Duchess Sibyl, and the contents
of numerous grimoires, scrolls, and librams. I have
resorted to reading from an occult tome that describes
the city of Phantos; so appalling are the secrets therein
evealed that I quote them verbatim, lest some reader
accuse me of inventing its horrors. So too have I studied
the writings of witches both light and malign; I have
trawled through accursed works that give a seeker
knowledge — a terrible knowledge I would sometimes
rather forget.

Be clear that I have no fondness for the dark things I
describe;                              and yet I ofler what I have read of the motives
and goals of such terrible sorcerous entities as Lilith and
Baphomet without comment — let the reader ascertain
the truth of their claims or prove them a lie.

Grim indeed are the threats that face us, and if one
should                             wonder why any sane man stays in these lands,
then let him remember that not all is given over to
horror — there are good folk and good places aplenty
here in the realms of Ainerêve. The Guardians’ Guild is
one beacon of light against the darkness, but all
kingdoms cry out for more heroes and heroines. Will you
be of their number?

Lest the reader should balk at the sheer number and
variety                                of beasts, let us recall the gates leading to worlds
far and near, to places, times, and dimensions as diverse
as the universe itself. Every kind of creature comes
crawling, slithering, loping, or charging through the
gates at Crossroads — truly the gates are both blessing
and curse.

To better categorize and explain these beings I have
applied                                 a system of numerical gradation and probability
mapping; the discerning adventurer will see from the
number ranges that the danger of each creature, its
resistances and abilities, are all clearly expressed. Now,
on to a consideration of the beings an adventurer
passing through Crossroads or crossing the lands of
Ainerêve might meet. Gird your sword, ready your
shield; if magic be your trade, then prepare a spell — for
surely battle is upon you and the diflerence betwixt life
and death no more than a quick wit or a quicker blade.

BESTIARY


Accursed, the

Type: Minor (undead)

Threat Dice: Natural d6 ~ Melee d4 ~ Ranged d4

Extra Attacks: d8 rotting attack, once per round (see
below)

Hit Points: 10 (7/3) [fast, medium, magical; ×1.5]
Damage Reduction: d4 (natural toughness)
Saving Throw: d4 to d8

Battle Phase d3

Legends and Lore: The accursed are shambling,
moaning                          zombies determined to eat the flesh of the
living. They are found in unhallowed graveyards and
defiled temples where the priesthood and acolytes
were murdered by some rival, evil god’s minions.

Abilities and Powers: The accursed are undead
creatures                            devoid of will and without any ability to
speak of, other than inflicting harm. They are
immune to curses, mental affliction effects, and
other necromantic energies that would seek to harm
or control them. Each accursed also possesses a
rotting power. If this d8 attack penetrates a target’s
chosen active defense, it causes d4 to be lost from
the Passive Defense Pool (DP) each round until a
revitalization effect is used to stop it.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: The accursed do not
generally wear armor; if one does, it’s falling apart
and basically useless. They cannot wield any weapon
that provides specific bonuses (being minor), but
they can be described as wielding whatever the GM
describes (mechanically, it makes no difference).

They carry only trinkets: 1–6 coins and 1% chance of
1                             minor magic item per group for treasure.

Ambulant Thresher

Type: Standard (plant)

Threat Dice: Natural 2d10

Extra Attacks: d10 (suffering slumber attack)
Hit                         Points: 40 (30/10) [fast, large, magical; ×2]
Damage Reduction: 4 (natural)

Saving Throw: d10

Battle Phase d6

Legends and Lore: Three summers past, the druid
Cathbad,                              when returning from some far distant
sphere, brought back with him three strange
seedlings. These plants, each with oddly tentacle-
like leaves, grew swiftly into life-threatening man-
eaters and multiplied rapidly. They now rove
woodlands seeking prey, and if unable to get it, will
quest even into villages or farms. According to
Nathal, who has hunted down a score of these
horrors, when fully grown a thresher resembles a
bulbous black cactus crowned with a quartet of long
purple tentacles. One can grow to twice the size of a
man. Its movement is a wobbling undulation of its
lower quarters that lets it ripple across the ground
with surprising swiftness. Why the threshers seek
out sentient prey is unknown; however, in the
Grimoire of Giseld, it is written that there are
unsettled realms where thoughts are food and where
pain-wracked consciousness can be channeled to
alien gods for whom suffering is sustenance. The
plant-beings were first known in Crossroads,
although they have spread across the land despite
the efforts of Nathal.

Abilities and Powers: A thresher can strike at
multiple                               foes with its tentacles; range equals its
trunk’s height — typically 5 to 12 feet. Strikes
penetrating to reduce Passive DP cause pain and
lethargy, so that those struck multiple times will be
slowed (save vs. Fortitude) and eventually slip into a
suffering slumber where they dream of torture and
death. Simultaneously, the thresher digs small roots
into their brains to drain nutrients and in time

334


extinguish life. The spiky projections on a thresher’s
trunk                            pose a hazard to one fighting it at close
quarters.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: The cactus-like
trunk                                of the thresher is equal to hide armor; spikes
may strike an adversary in close melee (+1 to
potential harm when engaged unarmed or with short
weapons). They have no treasure, but legend has it
that eating the plant flesh of the thresher grants one
a glimpse of the final memories of its recent victims.

Afriti

Type: Exceptional

Threat Dice: Arcane 3d12 ~ Natural d6 ~ Melee d4 ~
Ranged d4

Hit Points: 72 (54/18) [fast, medium, preternatural;

×2]

Damage Reduction: Immune to fire, normal or
magical

Saving Throw: d12 or 3d12 versus Elementalism Fire
spells                              (other than Harm)

Battle Phase d16

Legends and Lore: There are combustible realms in
Ainerêve where fury flashes ignite into raging
elemental storms; such are elemental spheres of fire
and magma. The afriti, it is said, are but one of many
fire-beings that dwell in such inhospitable realms,
although the gnome explorer Sprouta claims they
have fashioned a city of sorts that floats upon an
ever-burning sea of flames.

Sparks of anger form the afriti; fire and smoke
bound                                into a shifting, sometimes man-like, form.
When they attack, their upper body blazes outwards
in a fan-like glare in which a hateful countenance
can be seen. As to their will and purposes, who can
say? But one summoned into our own realms is a
thing of spite and fury; if you meet one, lay it low, for
its anger cannot be quenched, not even in the depths
of the sea.

Abilities and Powers: The afriti are invulnerable to
fire;                            however, an attack, magical or otherwise, that
incorporates water or ice will cause double normal
harm. The afriti creates a field of fire about itself that
burns anyone close enough to strike a blow against
it. At will, it can project fire up to twenty feet away:
such a strike ignites combustible materials and
causes ongoing burns. It can envelop a foe in its body
of magma and flame, immolating its victim within
its fiery core.

He who binds an afriti can force it to do three tasks;
the                             greater amongst their number can cause reality
shifts sufficient to grant a wish, but not one that is
overly powerful or that disturbs the stability of a
given realm too much. Let summoner or binder
beware: all such wishes and tasks are fuelled by hate;
that which comes forth from anger is ignobly born,
and surely any creation of hate will bear bitter fruit.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: For occult reasons,
brass                            does not melt in the hands of an afriti; they
have an affinity for it, adorn themselves in curious
brazen jewelry, and sometimes bear other artifacts
of brass — likewise, fire opals, bloodstones, and
rubies are unharmed by an afriti’s fiery touch.

Treasure carried is in the range of a trove: 200–2000
coins                             and a 30% chance of d3 magic items.

Amphisbaena

Type: Exceptional

Threat Dice: Arcane 3d8 ~ Natural 3d6

Hit Points: 72 (18/54) [tough, huge, preternatural;

×3]

Damage Reduction: Immune to mental and spiritual
afflictions

Saving Throw: d10

Battle Phase d4

Legends and Lore: Ouroboros unbound; cyclicity
become                             chaos; in essence, a large snake with a head
at each end of its broad barrel-like body with mouths
big enough to swallow a horse whole. Around the

335


BESTIARY


amphisbaena, vegetation spoils and dies. Only in
water                              does it regain tranquility. If submerged
beneath the water, one head swallows the other, and
Ouroboros is reborn. From whence does it come?

From dreams of greed, I am told, that cause
Ouroboros                                to unbind; the natural order is usurped by
lust for something — usually wealth or power. That
which should be tranquil and peaceful, wise and
eternal, becomes a raging coiling avatar of death.

Abilities and Powers: One of the cavernous
serpentine                             maws can breathe poisonous vapors; the
other has fangs dripping a dreadful green caustic
venom that pits the very ground it falls upon.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: True to the greed
that                               gave it birth, the amphisbaena always seeks, or
possessively guards, some object of desire — it will
be a thing of great value, whether financial, magical,
or living: a person, an artist, a beauty, a creator or an
inventor may be taken this way. A traveler from
Meath, one whose beard was green, hinted to me
that at times the very victim of the amphisbaena is
its creator, although how or why that should be is a
mystery upon which I cannot comment.

Angel

Type: Legendary

Threat Dice: Melee 2d12+8 ~ Ranged 2d10+5 ~
Natural 2d8+7 ~ Arcane d12+5

Hit Points: 60 (30/30) [normal, nedium,
supernatural; ×2.5]

Damage Reduction: By armor, shield, or magic item.

Saving Throw: 2d10

Battle Phase d10 or d12

Legends and Lore: Angels are beatific celestial
beings,                                as one would probably imagine. There’s not
some imperative that each has to have a pair of
wings, much less a harp, but all will be powerful, not
only in might but also in wisdom. Angels are
symbolic of all that is just and holy in the spiritual
world. They often serve as proxies to the celestial

gods. Their incarnation in the mortal realm is usually
humanoid and of the most handsome and superior
sort but depends on its associated deity and culture.
A high-ranking priest may summon one, or the
master deity may send an archangel on a mission to
the mortal realm. They are proud and willful, rarely
merciful if provoked, and do not take direct
commands unless issued by a higher power. An angel
does not ordinarily stay around once its mission is
finished unless it must guard some important, holy
place. Archangels are supposed to exist, few in
number but even more powerful: the radiance of
their glory is said to burn up mere mortals who gaze
on them.

Abilities and Powers: An angel’s average ability is at
a                               d12 (basic) + d12 (specialty). Angels typically have
adept, Theurgist, and warrior advantages and
theurgist feats; but just about any skill imaginable is
possible. Languages spoken include the common
trade language, plus Celestial. Also, angels can
invoke the following powers using their Arcane
threat dice:

Spiritual blast (Challenge Die d8, Save None): A
harmful                             stream of brilliant, electric-blue light that
sears the target’s soul, bypassing Agility DP. Add +4
to Challenge Die to make it an area effect spell.

Command the infidel (Challenge Die d10, Save
Fortitude → Willpower): The angel intones a
command, and the target cannot help but obey.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Any weapon and
any                              armor, usually magical with up to +5 in bonuses
to protection or damage. Their usually ranged
weapon is a bow. Angels may have any piece of
equipment desired but do not carry food, coin, or
other sundries because they don’t have bodily needs.
They will carry a magic item other than their
weapons 85% of the time — usually an orb or wand
of some kind. Typically, angels carry a special holy
weapon (any type) with the following properties:

336


Holy Weapon: The general properties of the weapon
match                                that of the type. It has up to a +5 bonus to
damage. It can also do +8 non-physical Energy harm
once a round (this is a permanent effect). In the
hands of an angel, a holy weapon does triple damage
versus demons (including the bonus and non-
physical harm).

Anthropophagi

Type: Standard

Threat Dice: Natural 2d6 ~ Melee d4

Hit Points: 18 (9/9) [normal, medium, magical; ×1.5]

Damage Reduction: –2 versus natural or
bludgeoning attacks

Saving Throw: d4 to d8, immune to mental affliction

Battle Phase d6

Legends and Lore: My source for information about
these                            man-like cannibals may not be reliable. Much
of what I am told comes from the goblinoid half-orc
Throk. He tells me he has seen the dreaded Revel of
Flesh, a dance and unholy feasting conjured up from
the darkest pits. He saw the anthropophagi, their
near-naked bodies deformed by the spirit-energy of
the victims they eat — frightened faces bulge from
bellies, extra eyes open on arms, a second face on the
back of the head, writhing mouths opening like
wounds on torso and limb. Among them are the most
fearsome of their kind, the blemmyes, so deformed
as to now resemble little more than a headless torso
of combined flesh, a trunk from which sprout arms
and legs at awkward angles, askew, misaligned. A
great face forms in the midst of the torso, its thick-
lipped mouth full of teeth and ready to devour yet
more men. The Revel of Flesh is spreading, I am told;
it is a dance writhing in the shadows and at night the
anthropophagi stumble, bumble, and tumble into
moonlit groves to begin a hunt for more eyes and
mouths to join their horrid feasting.

Abilities and Powers: Attacks are a mixture of bites
and                         clubbing strikes; if a victim is grappled, he will
be bitten many times. A bite from a blemmyes will

337

induce a blasphemous craving in a victim, an unholy
desire                                 to dance and feast on the flesh of men, or
worse still, a desire to be eaten, a wish to be
consumed (save vs. Fortitude → Willpower, once at
the time of the bite, then once per day).

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Incidental wealth
may                            abound; anthropophagi have no use for a
victim’s possessions — they will be scattered, as
may be entrails and body parts, in the wake of their
dreadful dance. It is possible that within one of these
cannibals, an item of value might be found, eaten
thoughtlessly as its struggling owner was devoured.

Damage Reduction: Immune to Elementalism (Air)
spells

Saving Throw: 2d10

Battle Phase d10+2

Legends and Lore: Of the arimaspians, I speak with
authority, for I was a “guest” of their Duke
Pathafarial in his cloud-borne palace. A single eye
glares from the forehead of these cyclops-like
human-sized warriors. They are ruthless reavers,
plunderers of gold — they are adorned with gold
jewelry and lust after the metal. Dressed in
flamboyant nautical garments, they have a bronze,
almost gold, hue to their skin and an evil demeanor.
They enslave griffins and are oft encountered
mounted upon or leading such beasts. They are
pirates of the skies, flying upon their fearsome
subjugated steeds.

Abilities and Powers: They can conjure forth mists
and                             winds, and the greatest amongst them can cause
clouds to become as ice and bring forth sleet or snow

— among their own kind, these wielders of
elemental                            magic are called navigators. An ice cloud

formed as a flying creature passes through it
becomes                                 a prison (Challenge Die d10; save vs.
Fortitude). The ice clouds stay aloft unless cast to
earth by the arimaspian sorcerer. Their warriors,
invariably led by a flamboyant or aggressive captain,
wield cutlasses, and some bear fearsome weapons of
metal and wood that can shoot balls of lead into a
man’s heart. These somehow make use of an
alchemical black powder. Only the arimaspians and
the sea elves know the secrets of such “pistols,” as
they name them. Flying ships have been reported,
upon which are mounted siege engines of iron and
flame, so-called “cannons,” able, they say, to lay
low a city from the air.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Gold, jewels,
enchanted                           weapons, magical items that grant the
power of flight, even flying ships, islands, and
palaces, all await the adventuring band that can
defeat the arimaspians. Their cutlasses add bonus
threat points to Melee attacks with microbursts of air
at every point of impact (+1 threat point per strike).
Some also wield bizarre weapons that belch noise,
fire, and brimstony smoke, as below.

Banshee

Hit Points: 105 (53/52) [normal, medium,
supernatural; ×2.5]

Damage Reduction: –2 against all potential harm

Saving Throw: d12, or 2d14 versus spiritual
afflictions

Battle Phase d10

Legends and Lore: Fearsome spirit-women of
Maedoen,                              the banshee are harbingers of death. Oft
appearing as old crones holding out bloodied

clothing, with sly grins upon their age-wracked
faces;                                 it is said that a warrior recognizing his own
garb in the banshee’s claws is doomed. Alternatively,
the banshee might take the guise of a fair maid to
lead a warrior astray — to where something horrid
lies in wait. In the library of Duchess Sibyl, I found a
scroll reportedly penned by the Eldritch Man. It says
the banshee seek vengeance for every bitter and
heartless deed warrior-men have done and that they
shall take vengeance until moon and sun shine
together in a darkened sky.

Abilities and Powers: One who sees his own clothes
in                                the banshee’s grasp, hears her mournful and
frightsome keening wail, or is led away by her from
his comrades into the dark wood, mist, or mire, falls
under a curse, and death will stalk him by day and by
night. (Save versus Willpower, or else suffer +2
potential harm from all traps and hazards, plus –1
rank per tier on all Saving Throws until the curse is
lifted.)

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Some locations, the
sites                               of remorseless deeds perhaps, become nexial
gathering places for the banshee, and in such locales,
the bodies of many warriors might lie, adorned still
with armor and treasures, with sword and steel.

Baphomet

Type: Legendary (avatar)

Threat Dice: Arcane 3d12 ~ Melee 3d12 ~ Ranged

Hit Points: 108 (81/27) [fast, large, supernatural; ×3]

Damage Reduction: d12 (plate armor)

Saving Throw: 3d14

Battle Phase d14

Legends and Lore: Here I shall write of that which
men                                call Baphomet; I find little, even in the darkest
grimoires, to tell me the truth of this being that some
claim is demonic, but for certain he has truck with
much that is demoniacal and of the shadow. There
are the oddest hints, webs of thought linking

338


Baphomet with the Templar Knights, but how can
this                             be? They that so staunchly, even heartlessly,
cleanse (or persecute?) all they deem heretics,
witches, or demonists, let alone demons, how can
they have any communion with the Sabbatic Goat?

Baphomet can put on the guise of any man or spirit

— why, some scrolls even claim any god — that he
chooses. The avatar so assumed can take many
forms, but when contemplating Baphomet, the
reader of this bestiary is best served by considering
Baphomet’s accepted image — half male, half
female, the body parts of human and goat, phallic in
its strength, creative in its potency; an embodiment
of occult and alchemical concepts and power.

To the inner cabal of those who secretly worship
Baphomet,                              his existence is known to be the result of
all humanity’s desires, all magical workings, the
wizardly attempts to lift humanity’s status of the
divine. To the true Baphomet believer, there are no
real gods, no true devils — both are manifestations
of limitation; artificialities created by human
consciousness fearing its own power; thus, they say,
men have made two masters, two rods for our backs.
And yet, their texts say the power of freedom will not
be denied, so we have fashioned an occult key in
addition to our prison. That key is Baphomet, and
both Heaven and Hell fear the nullification
Baphomet will bring: death, night, and a new dawn
in a new Eden — one built by the true will of man.

Baphomet hates the powers of Hell and all so-
called                               gods, whether divine or darkly satanic: they
are artificialities that existed before him (or so he
and his adherents claim) and obstacles to his will. He
would undo the whole of creation, turn it back to
primal matter, so that man can start again and build
a better and more fitting world — or so Baphomet
believes. All gods are demiurges, craftsmen of
inferior skill who have built a prison for life rather
than paradise to their followers. In this view,
Baphomet is “good” because he will liberate life by
destroying the illusion/matter that binds us. Good
and Evil both are part of the system Baphomet would

destroy. And thus it is that Baphomet seeks some
method                                to undo creation here in Ainerêve; to reshape
Earth via humanity’s dreams — to reorder reality in
reverse from the dream world back into the physical.
To do this, he must gain power here, and he plays a
long game, willing to take centuries, for what are
years when placed against eternity? Heaven and Hell
have become aware of his strategies. They have
woven a web of energy, light, and dark across
Ainerêve to bind Baphomet’s power as best they may
go through a strange and unexpected alliance. In
response, Lilith, Baphomet’s bride — and some say
creatrix — has sent her presence too, seeking a way
to free her consort’s full energies once more.

Abilities and Powers: Although many forms might be
taken, I have read of three (all extraordinary
mortals): the knight, the bard, and the emissary. The
knight brings war, is garbed in impenetrable steel, is
fear made manifest, and can stand in tourney against
any champion. The bard would appear to bring
merriment, and jovial clowns may follow in his
wake; quick of wit and sharp eye, he makes a play of
every drama he sees and stirs drama where peace
once prevailed. Quick to feel boredom and
carelessness of those he might hurt, he moves on
swiftly after spreading his stage across a tavern,
village, or even a kingdom. The emissary he offers
much, is peace made real; soft, kind, cheerful, quick
to please others, and ever wanting the approval of
those he meets, and yet, if it is not given, he will fall
into the depths of sorrow, and swiftly thereafter fade
beneath the shadow, and in his going call forth bard
or knight — or something even more fearsome,
bestial, and dark.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Any. Without
exception,                         Baphomet’s avatars will be adorned with
strange, often cursed and dangerous, items of the
most complex sorcery. Baphomet may choose to
leave such behind when seemingly defeated; indeed,
his whole purpose for coming might be to leave a
trinket, an item worthy of Pandora, when he departs.

Treasure possessed is a hoard: 1000–10,000 coins

Basilisk

Type: Standard to Exceptional

Threat Dice: Natural 2d10 to 3d10 ~ Ranged (special)

~ Arcane (special)

Extra Attacks: Killing miasma, gaze, and rotting bite

Hit Points: 60 to 90 (15/45 to 23/67) [tough, huge,
preternatural; ×3)

Damage Reduction: +2 hit points (tough hide)

Saving Throw: d10 to d12

Battle Phase d6

Legends and Lore: Existing in multiple forms, or
perhaps                            breeds, the basilisk is the king of serpents,
distinguished by a crown-like crest and a single
white spot between its narrow reptilian eyes —
unlike other serpents, its eyes are man-like, with
heavily hooded lids and a pronounced slant. In youth
no more than twelve fingers in length, the thing
grows both in size and danger, so that when fully
grown, it rears up to the height of a man atop a
horse, and in length exceeds that of three horses.

Abilities and Powers: Greater basilisks exude a
killing                             miasma, so their very presence causes death,
not only in man but in beast and plant too; where
goes the basilisk, there goes death and decay and
desert. Their glance is fatal, stopping breath; their
bite so caustic that the venom penetrates not only
the victim but also anything or anyone touching the
victim. A basilisk biting a horse will kill its rider too,
the very skin and flesh rotting from man and mount,
leaving nothing but bones and skulls, half-clothed in
the flesh.

Killing miasma: Any creature within 5 feet must save
versus Fortitude or fall incapacitated and take d10 to
3d10 harm every round thereafter, depending on the
basilisk’s size and age.

Gaze: Victim must roll vs. Competence → Perception
to                             avert gaze else suffer harm directly to Passive

Defense (d10 to 3d10, depending on the basilisk’s
size                           and age).

Rotting bite: Regular shields and armor can protect
the                            defender but make item saving throws versus the
basilisk’s threat rank dice or be destroyed. Make a
Fortitude save if even one point reduces Passive DP;
failure to save inflicts another threat dice roll
affecting Passive DP.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: I am told by the
elven                             traveler Nathal that a visitor to the Seelie Court
brought a tale told in the east, that each basilisk
guards a gem of great size (value 10,000–60,000 in
coin), and that if this gem is properly incubated, a
dragon will come forth from it. Of the truth of this, I
cannot say.

Brownie

Type: Minor to Standard

Threat Dice: Any attack type, d4 to 2d4

Hit Points: 4 to 8 (2/2 to 4/4) [normal, tiny, magical;

×1]

Damage Reduction: –1 if wearing properly sized
brownie armor

Saving Throw: d4 to d8

Battle Phase d4 to d8

Legends and Lore: The brownie is a tiny shee that
dwells                             unseen in the homes of mortals. Small men
and women with weedy arms and legs, clothed in
scraps of cloth and often with an acorn, thimble, or
spider-web shawl worn on the head; their spindly-
fingered hands are quick to perform all household
chores, and they can mend and fix too. If spied out of
the corner of the eye, one might be seen clutching
needle and thread, set upon useful tasks like
repairing socks, or busily knocking the dents out of a
damaged pot.

But a home blessed with brownies had best not
mention                               or watch the little things; they are shy and
wary, dislike attention, and will seek another home if
disturbed. Small gifts, a little milk, some cheese, and

340


bread perhaps, or maybe some cloth that they might
sew,                             will earn the brownies’ favor — but only if
given discreetly, without seeming to recognize the
little people’s presence at all.

Abilities and Powers: Brownies have magic of a kind
sort                              that helps with fixing, hiding, and bringing luck.
But if harmed, they can leave curses and misfortune,
cause hammers to hit fingers, pots to crack,
cauldrons to overflow, and hearth fires either to burn
too hot or fade and go out.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: It is a common
error                                 of all-too-greedy men to mistake the brownie
for some other type of shee altogether and seek from
it some fabled and non-existent pot of gold as if the
thing were a miserly leprechaun — doing so is
unwise. The foolhardy mortal who treats a brownie
so will regret it until the end of his stubbed-toed,
broken-tooled days. They do often carry trinkets: 1–
6 coins and 1% chance of 1 minor magic item.

Capture Vine

Type: Minor (plant)

Threat Dice: Natural d12 (capture & constriction)
Hit                          Points 18 (6/12) [tough, large, magical; ×1.5]
Damage Reduction: +3 (tough nature)

Saving Throw: d4 to d8 versus physical

Battle Phase It doesn’t move; d10 for initiative when
in striking distance.

Legends and Lore: There’s always some sort of plant
life                               out in the world that wants to kill you. Capture
vines prefer a slow death for their victims. The
sentient vine will detect warm blood, lash out, wrap
its vines around the neck or torso, and pull its victim
to its central stalk, where thousands of hollow
needles prick the skin and drain the blood. If the
plant wins surprise, it can bring out a vine to capture
and constrict with amazing speed. However, it is
otherwise immobile, its central stalk being rooted
into something organic: the soil, timber, even a dead
body.

Abilities and Powers: In the first round, the vine rolls
d12                            against the target’s Prowess → Agility (Reaction):
success means capture. In the round after a capture,
an opposed roll of d12 is made versus the victim’s
Prowess. If the victim succeeds, he can escape.

Otherwise, he will take d12 points of constriction
damage                          to Passive DP, with armor adding to the
damage (roll its value and add).

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: The Capture Vine
has                            natural “armor” of d8 because its stalks and
vines are very tough to break or cut. Plants don’t
carry treasure.

Centaur

Type: Standard to legendary

Threat Dice: Natural 2d6 ~ Melee 2d4 ~ Ranged 2d4

~ Arcane d4 (10%)

Extra Attacks: Kick d10+4

Hit Points: 24 (6/18) [tough, large, magical; ×2]
Damage Reduction: +2 (large and tough hide)
Saving Throw: d4 to d8

Battle Phase d10+d6 (speed)

Legends and Lore: The centaur has the lower body of
a                               horse but the torso, arms, and head of a man. Two
distinct species exist, albeit some claim that they are
the same, their natures changing when provoked or
roused to lust. No matter, whether two species, or
one in which two natures war, the practicalities are
the same: in some the animal nature dominates —
this is the animal-side of man given form here in the
vision-world of Ainerêve; he is bestial, drunken,
savage, prone to heavy drinking, acts of debauchery,
and even rape. However, at times, or in one
variation, the centaur represents what nature and
the animal kingdom can teach man: he is a scholar, a
teacher — such centaurs are wise, learned, and
might even impart knowledge and skill to children of
men. In Crossroads, the arrival of centaurs causes
unease; the Guardians’ Guild has requested that all
such beings be prevented from drinking alcohol.

341


BESTIARY


Abilities and Powers: Centaurs are excellent archers,
huntsmen, and warriors, unparalleled in their skill
with the spear, club, and bow. Some few, of both
variations, can cause trees to walk, animals to do
their will, and the forces of nature to accommodate
their wishes — but this capacity is rare (10%
chance), and the workings of such wonders seem
more incidental than planned, instinctive rather
than deliberate.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: The cerebrally
inclined                        species of centaur may possess ancient
knowledge and scrolls, although they rarely work
magic. Centaurs travel light, but many possess in
their domiciles a trove: 200–2000 coins and 30%
chance of d3 magic items.

Changeling

Type: Standard (fay)

Threat Dice: Arcane 2d8 ~ Melee 2d6 ~ Natural 2d8 ~
Ranged 2d4

Hit Points: 40 (30/10) [fast, large, preternatural;

×2.5]

Damage Reduction: By any armor worn

Saving Throw: d16

Battle Phase d10+4

Legends and Lore: Doppelganger infiltrators
spreading                            paranoia and dissension everywhere while
fostering distrust and mystery, changelings are part
of the various societies of the Fay, living mostly in
the great forest of Meath. They waylay travelers from
settled lands to steal their shiniest possessions or
walk throughout the kingdoms seeking to seduce or
lure hapless folk into the dark of the forest, where
human souls are forsaken and memories lost.

Abilities and Powers: Changelings are masters of
deceit                             and trickery, with a high level of skill in
Competence → Adroitness → Skullduggery, ranging
from 2d6+2 to 2d12+5 depending on their expertise.
They possess the ability to shapeshift into the
semblance of any humanoid species, short or tall,

with their powers limited to the range of “self” and
requiring no Ability tests. This makes them highly
adaptable and dangerous in social encounters.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Changelings can use
any weapon or armor, limited only by the size of the
form assumed at the time. Their equipment melds
into a new form during a shape-shift but can be
willed back onto the body and into hands after the
change. Changelings often keep their treasure in
their domiciles, typically a small trove of 100–600
coins with a 20% chance of d2 magic items. When
encountered, they may carry trinkets, and 20% of
those encountered will have some sort of magic item,
often designed to block psychogenic power or
scrying.

Cockatrice

Type: Exceptional

Threat Dice: Natural 3d4

Extra Attacks: Petrification

Hit Points: 24 [normal, large, magical; ×2]

Damage Reduction: None

Saving Throw: 2d8 or d4 versus mental harm

Battle Phase d8

Legends and Lore: The cockatrice is a dragon-like
combination                               of serpent and cockerel; its head is a
fighting cock with a sharp beak and wide eyes.

Likewise, its two limbs are feathered, positioned at
the                               fore of its serpentine, coiling body, where they
can be used in movement, or to strike with vicious
bird-like talons. Its body has a warty, toad-like
appearance. The creature is large, twice the height of
a man.

Abilities and Powers: Fearsome indeed is this fabled
bird,                              for it can turn a man to stone — some by
pecking, others by a talon strike, a few by glance
alone, and, so I am informed by the priests of Astra,
who claim to have subdued such a creature, there are
cockatrices with the dragon-like breath, a poisonous

342


fume that brings either petrification or a slow
choking death.

Petrification: Every time threat points exceed active
defense and armor, the victim must make a save
versus Fortitude → Willpower or immediately take
3d4 points to Passive DP. The victim is turned to
stone permanently if Passive DP depletes to zero.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: The cockatrices like
their                          reflections and will gather up gold and position
shiny metals, so they glimpse themselves passing by.
Curiously, in the presence of a cockatrice, gold
develops a greenish sheen, and silver slowly fades to
a tarnished black. A party of treasure seekers set out
from Crossroads one autumn, seeking the cockatrice
called Ignatious by the fay folk of Meath; a treasure
hunt was this, sadly unsuccessful, but the two that
returned alive from the dark statue-studded glen
where Ignatious roams and pecks claim it to be filled
with treasures.

Demon

Type: Legendary

Threat Dice: Melee 3d16 ~ Arcane 2d12 ~ Natural
2d18                           ~ Ranged 2d12

Hit Points: 120 (60/60) [normal, medium,
supernatural; ×2.5]

Damage Reduction: By any armor worn

Saving Throw: 2d12*

Battle Phase d10

Legends and Lore: Demons are malignant spiritual
tumors,                              the cloacal concentrations of every foulness,
sniggering malice, brutality, perversion, and
derangement in the mind of man. Their form is thus
often humanoid but twisted: leering, evil-visaged,
bat-winged, horned; their nature is protean, so some
have fearful forms out of nightmare or can even
assume a pleasing shape for a while to seduce or
deceive. They serve infernal powers and themselves.
Luckily they are so chaotic and violent that they
spend as much time infighting as defiling or

destroying the good. Demons, like angels, are nearly
demigods and are not to be thrown into the path of
adventurers on a whim. Possessing supernatural
strength and skill, these creatures inflict devastating
amounts of damage, are cruel beyond measure, have
high resistance to magic, and grant no mercy.

Furthermore, they can summon hordes of minions to
aid them — up to 2d20 devilish imps per round (TY
Minor / TD Melee d4 ~ Natural d4 ~ Ranged d4 ~
Arcane d4 / HP 4).

Abilities and Powers: Demons can know just about
any                               skill and possess any imagined ability. They can
see in the dark or cast any Elementalism (Fire),
Sorcery, or Hieraticism spell with an effect of Afflict,
Harm, or Modify. They use the Arcane rank of 2d20
for all spells and innate powers causing damage or
other effects. Their innate powers have no Challenge
Dice:

Infernal blaSaving Throw: A harmful bolt of fiery red
energy sears the target for 2d20 harm.

Command the weak: (Save Fortitude → Willpower):
The                          demon intones a command, and the target’s
body cannot help but obey.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Demons wear any
armor, wield any weapon (with weapon-based
bonuses), and possess vast treasure in their abodes
(hoard: 1000–10,000 coins and 40% chance of 4
esoteric or better magic items).

Saving Throw: 3d10, +1 per stage*

Battle Phase d10

* Die rank or value generally depends on age; see
below.

Foolhardy are the adventurers of every world, every
realm, and as those passing through Crossroads are
no different, I will include in this bestiary a
description of those fabled beasts called dragons. But
first, a word to the wise, a suggestion to every

would-be dragon hunter: don’t! Do not seek out the
great                             wyrms, go not near their cavernous abodes,
pretend for all the world that they do not exist, and
hope beyond hope that one never decides to seek out
you.

Now, as this advice will doubtless be ignored, we
move                                on to the creatures themselves, although truth
be told, they deserve their own volume. When met in
the flesh (or in the scale?), a dragon is much as
traditionally depicted — a fiery, flying, scaled
monstrosity; its wings are bat-like, its body
serpentine. They have varying limbs, hues, and
abilities: four-legged, fire-breathing specimens are
the most widely reported. And yet, be prepared for
more snake-like horrors, with but two forepaws, or
six-legged examples that will sweep down upon you,
blast you to the floor with their wings, and then
snatch you up with your companions, fly high, and
drop you. Some dragons are tied to a single element.
Thus there are storm dragons of the air, water
dragons of the deep, rock-like dragons, and even
lava dragons. Cultural influences too shape the

dragon and its powers; thus, I am told, in certain
oriental                          realms, the dragons’ harbor wisdom rather
than hatred — a manifestation of cultural
expectation, not of the act that created the creature.

Legends and Lore: I have many reports, and yet I
must                                 be concise. Perhaps a consideration of what
forms most dragons is in order. Dragons are born in
unsettled lands; they are stray currents of energy,
usually, but not always, of a negative kind. When
some great and powerful evil occurs on Earth — a
massacre, an act of genocide, or some other
terrifying evil — the psychic repercussions would
disrupt any settled land, no matter how close it hews
to its earthly archetype, and so the waves of
unfulfilled destiny manifest in Ainerêve as a
vengeance-seeking beast. The fearful, hateful,
angry, primitive core of its mind is a collective
creation of those Earth-bound people whose
horrifying death created the dragon — their anxiety,
grief, fury, and despair. Normally dragons are drawn
to travel the unsettled lands until they reach the
borders of a settled realm, one with a culture the
dragon’s subconscious collective memory recalls.

Often this initial manifestation takes the form of an

egg; I am told some dragons breed true, and thus, if
two meet, they can create more eggs, a ripple of
destruction that has crippled kingdoms, laid low
empires, and killed more adventurers than legends
can count.

Abilities and Powers: We will speak first of typical
dragons                                if any can be called such; a plume of fiery
breath, hot enough to sear the flesh from bone; if
airborne, a deadly swoop, snatch, lift and drop;
hovering, blindness caused by whirled up soil and
debris, plus strikes from every claw; a lashing tail
that can knock even an ogre prone. Yes, those but
recently hatched are easier to destroy, but where you
see whelps, be ready for their larger kin. The dragon
is sharp in all its senses, with the eyes of a hawk;
although prone to slumber, they awaken easily. I
have read of great invincible beasts that, sleeping for

344


centuries, grow so vast that the awakening of such
leads                             to cultural nullification and extinction in
surrounding realms — if the beast is evil, and most
are.

A dragon’s breath is magic energy, made of fire, cold,
lightning, or other destructive forms. Whatever the
type of breath weapon, the dragon is immune to that
type of damage. (Dragons increase in size and power
with age, in 6 stages: whelp, young, adult, old, elder,
ancient / TD, d10, d12, d14, d16, d18, d20 / EA d4, d6,
d8, d10, d12, d14 / HP ×1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4.)

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Dragons gather
treasure                               out of instinct, for, despite their often great
intellect, they are driven by the primitive lustful part
of their brain. The dragon is greedy in every regard,
not just in the eating of men but also in their goods’
plundering. Caches of weapons, antique armor,
masses of gold and silver, statuettes and gems, not
to mention antiques, librams, and magics rare, will
all be found in the abode of a long-lived dragon (a
typical dragon’s hoard: 10,000–60,000 coins and
50% chance of 8 magic items).

Dwarf

Type: Minor

Threat Dice: Natural d8 ~ Melee d8 ~ Ranged d4 ~
Arcane d4

Hit Points: 12 (3/9) [tough, medium, magical; ×1.5]
Damage Reduction: By armor and shield type
Saving Throw: d4 to d8

Battle Phase d4 to 6 average

Legends and Lore: Sons of the deep earth, born from
maggots hatched in a giant’s innards, according to
some; to others, a species forged by the primordial
gods themselves to be the lords of the earth and the
guardians of its secrets. In my own realm, so
common is the dwarvish race that to describe them
in a bestiary such as this would seem insulting; and
yet I am mindful that here in Crossroads, there is a
meeting of realms and realities, and not all who pass
this way will be familiar with this short, squat

345

humanoid race. How to describe a typical dwarf?
Could                               one describe a typical man? Let us picture a
man-like being, not dissimilar to the warrior races
that inhabit the northern Thule-like realms of some
Earth-realities. Standing less than five feet tall,
sometimes only four, the dwarf is small but
powerfully built, with muscles typically sheathed in
finely crafted mail of plate, for the dwarves are
smiths, master armorers, and weapon-crafters.

Not a few of their race know the secret of forging
magic                           weapons and other artifacts of strange
enchantment. One can’t discuss dwarves without
commenting on their beards, typically worn long,
ornamented, and styled. Length of beard is an
indicator of age, gold beads an indicator of the
station, and style an indicator of personality. Beware
the dwarf whose beard is unkempt; most likely, he is
a berserker or renegade.

And yet, there are many species of dwarf, some
black-hearted rather than stoic, some greedy rather
than taciturn. I have noted a species of dwarf that
passes oft through Crossroads and might be said to
dominate here in Ainerêve. They are the scions of a
stable realm connected to Crossroads called the Iron
Dome. They call themselves Nordwur and are garbed
in Viking-like gear (for those unfamiliar with
Scandinavian lore’s stable realms, picture a warrior
armed with round shield, cap-like metal helm with
partial face guard, mail armor, axe, and spear). They
are somewhat leaner of limb, paler of skin, and slyer
in demeanor than is otherwise common. They trade
in strange treasures, are greedy and dishonest, and
can forge powerful weapons, but beware their gifts
and trades, be careful of their bespiked, rune-cut
weapons forged of black steel.

Race reads better than Species for the most part.
Also,                              why dwarves here but not elves? Including
them in a bestiary is much less insulting than calling
them maggots…

Abilities and Powers: Typically, skilled with an axe,
maul, crossbow, and other arms; some have an


BESTIARY


ability to weave enchantments into the items they
forge                            (magic is of Earth Elementalism sort). For the
Nordwur, these enchantments come at a price to the
user, a curse of sorts that might give what the owner
seeks while taking away what he loves most.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Expect arms and
armor                                of the highest quality; often a goodly portion
of gold and gems, for even the most honorable of
dwarves has a dragon’s heart where the treasure is
concerned.

Elemental

Type: Exceptional

Threat Dice: Natural 3d6 to 3d12 ~ Arcane 3d6 to
3d12

Hit Points: 63 to 126 [any constitution, huge,
supernatural; ×3.5]

Damage Reduction: Immune to one elemental
sphere;                     same as composition

Saving Throw: d16 or 2d8

Battle Phase d12 to d20

Legends and Lore: Elementals are creatures of pure
Fire,                               Air, Earth, Water, or Energy. The building
blocks of Earthly creation, when combined they can
form material worlds — although doing so provokes
the wrath of their near-godlike elemental overlords,
who regard such creation as an abridgment of their
liberty. As the dream realms of Ainerêve settle into
substantial form, elementals can become ensnared
in the new realities, combined in physical
substantiality. They dislike this, and if broken free by
spell or mishap, will seek vengeance unless correctly
bound.

Abilities and Powers: Individual elementals vary in
threat dice, prowess, etc. Elementals can use any
elemental spell of their element, with no Challenge
Die needed. Their ranged attacks are magic
elemental threat points: elemental bolts or areas of
effect (up to Ranged × 2 feet radius) of 3d6 to 3d12
harm.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Elementals do not
carry weapons, armor, or treasure.

Elf

Type: Minor to full-fledged

Threat Dice: Melee d8 ~ Ranged d8 ~ Arcane d6 ~
Natural d4

Hit Points: 8 (4/4) [normal, medium, mundane]
Damage Reduction: By armor and shield type
Saving Throw: d10

Battle Phase: d8 to d12

Legends and Lore: Elves, rulers of the Forest of
Meath                                 as noted in the Bestiary of Signoret, are
known for their near-immortal nature, mastery of
bow and spell, and deep love for music, woodcraft,
and the wild. They cohabit closely with humans and
other races, sharing cultural traits such as a passion
for artistry and a profound connection to nature. The
various types of elves differ in their affinities and
lifestyles, each group adapting to its unique
environment and societal structure.

Varieties of Elves: High Elves are tall, graceful, and
noble,                                akin to kings among their kind. Though often
aloof, they possess deep magical knowledge and a
purity of heart. Forest Elves, also known as Wyld
Elves, embody the spirit of nature and are carefree
yet formidable in battle, with a strong bond to
woodland creatures. Sea Elves are masters of the
seas, exploring and occasionally raiding in their
magically powered ships, while Elves of Seadeep
dwell beneath the waves, with gills for breathing
underwater, residing in coral palaces among marine
life. Dark Elves, in contrast, are sinister and
accursed, living in subterranean caverns and
indulging in dark arts and cruel pursuits.

Credran (Elf)

Type: Exceptional Fay/Elves

Threat Dice: Melee d8 ~ Ranged d6 ~ Power d8
(elemental magic)

Hit Points: 40 to 60 [Constitution: High, Size:
Medium,                          Nature: Preternatural; HP Multiplier: ×1.5
to ×2]

Armor Rating: D6 (natural)

Saving Throw: d6+2

Battle Phase: d8

Legends and Lore: The Credran are exceptional elves
deeply connected to the Echoes Forest, a mystical
woodland where the material and dream realms
intertwine. They are known for their strong
connection to nature and mastery of elemental
magic. The Credran are the guardians of the Dran, a
powerful elemental spirit, and their covenant with
this spirit grants them elemental abilities, with each
leader embodying one of the primal elements—
wind, earth, fire, or night.

The Credran’s history is marked by both triumph
and                            tragedy, with the most notable event being the
fall of Prince Mathin the Gray, who succumbed to the
temptations of dark power. This betrayal
transformed him and eleven others into
Woodshades, a reminder of the delicate balance the
Credran must maintain between light and dark.

Abilities and Powers: The Credran wield elemental
magic                               tied to their forest home. They can manipulate
wind to disorient enemies, summon earth to entrap
or protect, conjure fire to purify or devastate, and
cloak themselves in shadows to move unseen. They
also possess the unique ability to summon echoes of
the past, using these reverberations to gain insight
or confuse their foes. Their shape-shifting abilities
enable them to assume the forms of animals native
to the Echoes Forest, enhancing their ability to blend
into their surroundings or ambush intruders.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: The Credran craft
their                       weapons and armor from the enchanted
resources of the Echoes Forest. Their bows, made
3f4r7om sacred trees imbued with forest magic, strike

true and with great force, while their blades, forged
from                        elemental stones, carry the earth’s power.

Credran armor, woven from living vines or
enchanted                             leaves, offers protection while
maintaining agility. The treasures of the Credran
reflect their deep connection to elemental forces and
their history, often including ancient artifacts, rare
magical plants, and finely crafted items of beauty.

Their holdings typically contain valuables worth
between                            500 and 2,000 coins, with a 50% chance of
1–3 magical items related to elemental magic or
sound.

Cultural Significance: Credran society revolves
around                               their covenant with the Dran and their duty
to protect the Echoes Forest. The forest itself is a
place where the boundary between the material
world and the dream realm is thin, allowing for a
deep, mystical connection with both. The Credran
honor this connection through rituals and
ceremonies that celebrate the elemental forces and
the spirits that dwell within the forest. The fall of
Prince Mathin the Gray and the creation of the
Woodshades serve as a powerful reminder of the
dangers of dark power, ingrained deeply within
Credran culture. Despite these challenges, the
Credran remain vigilant, their resolve strengthened
by their responsibility to uphold the balance between
light and dark, nature and magic, for the safety of
their people and the preservation of the Echoes
Forest.

Woodshades (Elf)

Type: Exceptional (Fallen Credran)

Threat Dice: Melee 3d8 ~ Ranged 2d4 ~ Power 2d6
Hit                             Points: 102 (77/26) [fast, medium, magical; ×1.5]
Armor Rating: 2d4 (Woodshade armor)

Saving Throw: 2d4+2

Battle Phase: d10

Legends and Lore: The Woodshades are a corrupted
form                               of the Credran, created when Prince Mathin the
Gray, once a revered leader, made a pact with the


BESTIARY


demon Lord Savinoth. This pact turned him and
eleven                              other Credran followers into dark elves with
powers related to shadow and night. These fallen
elves, now known as Woodshades, have become the
wardens of Umbra Keep, a place of perpetual shadow
and despair. The average Woodshade has an ebony
complexion, pale violet eyes, and raven-black hair,
standing over six feet tall with a lithely built frame,
reminiscent of their former elven grace but twisted
by darkness.

Abilities and Powers: A Woodshade can use the
power                              Form of Night, as the spell, at will. They can
also use the powers Manipulate Shadow, Continuous
Shadow, and Shadow Shield three times per day,
requiring no casting roll and incurring no
maintenance penalty. The Shadow Shield solidifies
shadow to create a dark shield (or augment an
existing shield), adding a shield damage reduction
effect of +2 while maintained. The Woodshades
retain their agility and combat prowess, now
enhanced by their dark powers, making them deadly
opponents in both melee and ranged combat.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Most Woodshades
wear                        Woodshade armor, which is magical dark leaf-
patterned leather offering 2d4 damage reduction.

Exposure to sunlight disenchants this armor, forcing
Woodshades to avoid daylight. Each Woodshade
typically has a cache of $20–200 and a 10% chance
of possessing a minor magic item. Their weapons are
often dark and twisted versions of the ones they
wielded as Credran, imbued with shadow magic.

Cultural Significance: The existence of Woodshades
serves                               as a constant reminder to the Credran of the
dangers of succumbing to darkness. Once noble
guardians of the Echoes Forest, these fallen elves
now embody the very corruption they once sought to
prevent. Their transformation has made them
creatures of shadow, bound to the dark powers they
serve, and their presence in Umbra Keep symbolizes
the eternal struggle between light and dark within
the Credran lineage..

Extantar

Type: Minor, up to Exceptional

Threat Dice: Natural 2d4 to 2d12~ Melee varies ~
Ranged varies ~ Arcane varies

Hit Points: 20 (10/10) to 105 (120/120) [any type, any
size,                         supernatural; ×2 to ×4]

Damage Reduction: Magic, if any. By armor or shield
type                         (Draumur armor and shields; see Ainerêve,
Unique Magical Armor).

Saving Throw: d8 to d12

Battle Phase d4 to d12

Legends and Lore: The mutable borders of the
Metere                                are home to a race of enigmatic beings known
as the Extantars. These mortal yet unfathomable
entities are the living embodiment of our dreams and
imaginings.

Their forms are not fixed but are influenced by the
observer's interpretation. Everyone perceives an
Extantar uniquely, their understanding shaping the
creature's form. One might behold a humanoid
figure with features shifting like the sands of time,
while another might discern an animal form, its skin
a canvas of ever-changing patterns. No two
observers will see the same Extantar in exactly the
same way.

The Extantars are not inherently aggressive, but
their                               alien nature and ever-changing appearance can
be disconcerting, even terrifying, to those unfamiliar
with the ways of the Metere acreature’s perception of
an Extantar can significantly influence their
interaction. One who perceives the Extantar as a
fearsome beast may react with caution or hostility,
while another who sees a benign, albeit alien, entity
may approach with curiosity or even camaraderie.

To those who are wise and wary, the Extantars can
serve                                 as a beacon of insight and understanding. They
may act as guides, their cryptic utterances a source
of wisdom. Their shifting forms, reflecting the
observer's deepest thoughts and fears, can serve as a
mirror to the soul, offering a unique perspective on
one's self and the world.

348


Abilities and Powers: The Extantar manifests as
nearly                                any form identifiable within its generative
culture’s culture and collective mythical
imagination. Its perceivers’ expectations, fears, and
thoughts can also influence its powers, even round to
round. The stats can mirror that of any creature in
the listings of this bestiary.

Armor, Equipment, and Treasure: Extantars carry
whatever weapons, armor, and equipment are
germane to their type and purpose.

Fox Folk

Type: Minor

Threat Dice: Natural d8 ~ Melee d6 ~ Ranged d6 ~
Arcane d4 (but see below)

Hit Points: 12 (6/6) [normal, medium, magical; ×1.5]

Damage Reduction: By armor or shield type

Saving Throw: d8

Battle Phase d10

Legends and Lore: Fox folk are mischievous,
sometimes                               even a little malicious, shee capable of
taking the form of a man-fox (a human with a fox
head), an ordinary fox, or a fully human form. They
are beautiful — females are seductive, males
handsome; like succubae and incubi, they can lead
mortals astray, yet their purposes are more often
mirthful than wicked. Tricksters, thieves, and
rogues, the fox-folk dress well and adorn themselves
with finery — they are alluring in all guises, real foxy
ladies and exotically handsome men. It is said that
those with black fur around their eyes when in fox-
form are unkinder, likely to be assassins, while those
with golden fur are kinder of heart, and although
inveterate tricksters, unlikely to harm.

Abilities and Powers: Masters of illusion and
physical                        transformation, they are oft-times drawn to
involve themselves in theatrical display, and roguish
fox-folk sometimes join or create their own,
traveling circuses and theatrical groups. Love spells,
invisibility charms, and other enchantments that

confound mislead, and mentally entrap the victim
are                                all part of the fox-folk armory of magic. They are
capable of casting any Sorcery spell, rolling 3d12
against the Challenge Die.

Armor, Equipment, and Treasure: Fox-folk favor
small                               fast weapons, shuriken, daggers, whips, hand
crossbows, and the like; some are adept with ropes; a
few, of a crueler and darker disposition, with the
garrote. Jewels, gems, small antiques, priceless
antiquities — all are of interest to the fox-folk, and
if they are not carrying them, you can be sure they
are scheming to steal such at the earliest
opportunity. It’s not unusual for the fox-folk to
possess a treasure trove: 200–2000 coins and 30%
chance of d3 magic items.

Gargoyle

Type: Standard

Threat Dice: Natural 2d8+1 (claws) ~ Melee 2d6 ~
Arcane d8

Hit Points: 24 (6/18) [tough, medium, magical; ×1.5]

Damage Reduction: +4 (stone skin) vs. slashing / -1
vs.                         bludgeoning & heavy piercing

Saving Throw: d10

Battle Phase d14

Legends and Lore: In appearance, the ugly gargoyles
resemble                                 the apotropaic waterspout carvings from
any church building. The hideous living gargoyles
are the secret creation of Psarmorum’s inner circle,
originally intended as a way to help convert the
heathen while protecting Psarmorum; an occult
plague secretly sent to terrorize Maedoen but
hunting through the woodlands of Meath too,
indiscriminate in their destructive acts, save for
never striking against a true believer in the church of
Sol Invictus.

Abilities and Powers: The gargoyles can sense
religious                          affiliation and do so by sniffing — only the
scent of a believer in Sol Invictus stills their cruel
claws. They can fly, have tough stone-like hides,

349


BESTIARY


and, by covering themselves with their typically bat-
like                            wings, increase this protection to near
invulnerability (DR +4). When still, a living gargoyle
is indistinguishable from a stone carving.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Gargoyles generally
attack                             with their claws. Their tough, stone-like hide
is more vulnerable to smashing weapons like maces
or mauls or piercing weapons like picks that pack a
hefty punch behind a single point of impact. They
rarely have treasure, although occasionally they are
used as couriers and might carry some secret
message, potion, or item to one of Psarmorum’s
agents.

Ghul

Type: Standard (Undead)

Threat Dice: Melee ~ d8+d6 ~ Natural d6+d4 ~
Ranged d8

Hit Points: 28 (7/21) [tough, preternatural, medium;

×2]

Damage Reduction: Immune to non-magical
weapons

Saving Throw: d4 to d8

Battle Phase d6

Legends and Lore: It is in the Book of Red Flowers
that                                  I read of the ghul, adherents of a bloody
cannibal cult; once mortal men, they transform
through participation in unholy rites into flesh-
feasting hunters of graveyards. Cult members
consider the ghul state a form of immortality; in
decadent cities, they partake in secret horrid feasts
that mirror the mass of Sol celebrated in
Psarmorum, but with a bloody host and with real
blood in their chalice too — one who “eats the body
and drinks from the cup” for many years will
eventually become undead and transform into a ghul.
It is rumored that the Guardians’ Guild suspects one
or more ghul to have passed through Crossroads, but
surely so blasphemous a cult could grow no root here
’neath the watchful gaze of Virgil. And yet, dark
auguries have of late troubled M’lady Sibyl…

Abilities and Powers: The ghul are undead, can
shape-shift                              to the form of a hyena, take on a man-
like hyena-headed form, or appear as mortal — but
the longer they have been in full ghul state, the less
human they appear. Enchanted weaponry is needed
to cause ghul permanent physical harm, although a
limb lopped off will not regrow and the severing of
the head is effective; even then, a horrid, convulsive
and continuous clawing occurs, dangerous to one
nearby (d8 potential harm). Depending on form
taken, attacks can be weapon strike, claw, or bite —
or all three.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Treasures owned in
mortal life, plundered grave goods, and items of
malevolent occult power might be found in a ghul’s
possession (small cache: 2–20 coins and 5% chance
of 1 magic item). Armor and weaponry, often of good
quality, can be found, especially so on one but
recently “rewarded” with the ghul-state.

Giant

Type: Standard to Exceptional

Threat Dice: Natural 2d10 to 3d12 ~ Melee 2d10 to
3d12 ~ Ranged 2d6 to 3d6 ~ Arcane nil to 3d12

Extra Attacks: Sweeping strike

Hit Points: 90 (23/67) to 108 (27/81) [tough, huge to
gargantuan, magical; ×2.5 to ×3]

Damage Reduction: By armor or shield (specially
fitted                           or made but same die or DR)

Saving Throw: d12 to 2d8+

Battle Phase d8

Legends and Lore: Let us reflect upon the several
forms                                 of giant, the different kinds of huge man-like
beings born in the cultural imaginations of Earth and
given birth here in Ainerêve — from the elemental to
the misshapen. Now, what one man might call a
giant, another might call an ogre. And where an ogre
to some is a lesser giant, or one able to pass itself off
as a man, to another it is the most fearsome of giant-
kin, and the most ravenous. No matter, let us say
that in general, the giantish races stand anything

350


from one and a half times the height of a man to
mighty                             titans that loom taller than a cathedral spire.
There are ice giants swathed in frost and animal
hides, fearsomely ugly fire giants with flaming fists,
trolls with sly faces and murderous claws, and every
other kind of giant being from folklore and myth.

While most are crude and dull-witted, some are
fairly                          personable: one such, an enslaved hulking
Viking-like Jotunn, dwelt here in Crossroads for
some months, fetching and carrying at its capricious
goblin-overlord’s whim, until the elf-son Nathal
forced the goblin to free it and let it pass home
through the gates.

Abilities and Powers: Typically armed with clubs,
large                            throwing rocks, and sometimes more
conventional weapons and armor. For the primitive
sort, just blows and kicks are enough to shatter most
foes. Elemental giants typically have some power,
great or small, to influence their environment: they
might produce flame, a patch of ice, a swirling mist,
or a deadly rock fall. Giantish mages have greater
powers and might summon elementals too.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: The first two: rough
animal hides through to iron plate; humble
huntsman’s gear through to the armaments of a
barbarian prince or knight. Fire giants forge armor
and weapons, other giants may trade for them or be
fitted out by an employer. Treasure always, for the
giants are plunderers born; a sack of loot — for the
largest perhaps a sack of struggling victims too. In
an ogre’s or giantish mage’s lair, wonders of
treasure, magic, and items rare — singing music
boxes, talking books, every item of fairytale lore. A
giant’s treasure is valued as a hoard: 1000–10,000
coins and 40% chance of 4 magic items.

Giant Ant

Type: Minor to Standard

Threat Dice: Natural d4 to 2d12 (bite)

Hit Points: 4 (2/2) to 24 (12/12) [normal, medium,
mundane]

Damage Reduction: +4 (chitinous hide) or special

Saving Throw: d6 to 2d8

Battle Phase d12

Legends and Lore: The giant ant is a peSaving
Throw:                                 it undermines castles, ruins fields, carries off
livestock, and even makes war — for the ants
together have a hive mind capable of the most
complex strategy. A typical specimen stands about a
pony’s size, although varieties smaller and larger
can be found.

Soldier ants have glowing runes on their segmented
bodies,                              gifts from the hive-queen, who works magic
spells. An established hive will even barter and trade
with human settlements. However, care should be
taken, for the ants often prefer to overrun and
occupy an established settlement when swarming
time comes. The queen, a cumbersome creature
surrounded by larvae, weaves magic and cuts runes
into her favored followers’ carapaces. The following
runes are known: yellow cross — the ant regenerates
harm (d4 per round); glowing blue circle —
invulnerability to normal weaponry (up to two
attacks per round); red triangle — fiery bite that
doubles harm (to Fortitude); purple star —
teleportation and phasing (the ant disappears and
reappears at will each round, always behind a new
victim if possible). Other runes certainly exist and
combinations of runes are common; the queen will
have warded herself with every rune she knows
(d4+1 of them)

Abilities and Powers: For the soldiers, bite and sting;
the                             latter injects a toxin that can paralyze or kill
(save vs. Fortitude). Red ant varieties inject a venom
that causes intense pain, disabling the victim and
making all tasks doubly hard; black ant toxin induces

BESTIARY


slumber and paralysis; green ant toxin can be deadly.
(Effects                             are respectively stun, but allows non-
combat actions without movement; incapacitate; and
poison: green ant’s attack roll versus victim’s
Fortitude, the difference in rolls applies as extra
damage to the Passive DP.) More humble worker ants
can bite, grab, and pull an opponent away — they
will mob a victim.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: The giant ants are
avid                             traders. The ant nest will contain a fortune in
treasure and plundered goods. Typically, a hive
trades to build up a surplus in wealth to buy food
stocks when war and raiding are unprofitable. The
queen will buy magic items too, since she eats them
to power her runes. The hive usually pools its
treasure together near the queen’s chamber, a
veritable dragon’s hoard: 10,000–60,000 coins and
50% chance of 8 magic items.

Giant Bird

Type: Standard to Exceptional

Threat Dice: Natural 2d6 to 3d10 (talons and beak)

Hit Points: 18 to 45 [normal, medium to gargantuan,
magical;                           ×2 to ×3]

Damage Reduction: None

Saving Throw: d4 to d8

Battle Phase d12 (large), d10 (huge), or d8
(gargantuan) in flight

Legends and Lore: Several giant bird species sweep
aloft                                on the air currents of Ainerêve. The best known
is the roc, so prodigious in size that it can bear an
elephant aloft or take a dragon in its claws. Giant
versions of more typical fowl exist too, eagles and
hawks, owls and robins. The latter talk, and can take
the form of red-jacketed men. Indeed, certain giant
owls have enchanted speech and a knowledge to rival
my own. Beware men in black and white harlequin
garb if they sport a feather in their cap — for they are
magpie robbers. Texts tell me sentience is common
in many of the greater birds, but not so in the roc.

Abilities and Powers: Sharp senses, swooping
attacks,                             grab and drop tactics, razor-like beaks and
talons. For some, transformation into men or
smaller birds.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: No treasure is
typical                                 in a giant bird nest, save perhaps that which
accidentally accrues to the predatory types as they
pluck up victims and carry them back — in such case,
any amount of valuables might be found amidst
stick, twig, bone, and moss. The more intelligent
may have garnered precious stuff, or dwell in
comfortable and furnished aeries. Those with a
magpie-like bent might actually be thieves and
deliberately rob goods and amass wealth (small
trove: 100–600 coins and 20% chance of D2 magic
items).

Giant Rat

Type: Minor

Threat Dice: Natural d4 (bite/claw)

Extra Attack: Disease (10%)

Hit Points: 4 [normal, small, mundane]

Saving Throw: d2

Battle Phase d10

Legends and Lore: What adventurer worth his salt
hasn’t                           bravely faced down some rodent of unusual
size? For the neophyte, it’s practically a rite of
passage! Next to goblins, it’s what many aspiring
kings and would-be Destroyers of Worlds start with,
early in their careers. In a land rich in heroes, these
creatures might well be placed on the king’s
endangered species list.

Abilities and Powers: Giant rats only have the power
to                              scare children or give warriors a reason to wear
thick boots, although in greater numbers they can
rise above the level of mere annoyance. Some (10%)
are capable of inflicting disease on somebody after
penetrating armor and if a Fortitude → Endurance
check against threat dice is failed, at which point it

352


deals 1 point of harm per round until the victim falls
unconscious and starts to die from a wasting disease.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: These rodents have
no                         equipment or treasure, save perhaps a gold coin
or two in their stomachs.

Gnome

Type: Minor

Threat Dice: Melee d6 ~ Ranged d4 ~ Arcane d10 ~
Natural d4

Hit Points: 15 (8/7) [normal, medium, magical; ×1.5]
Damage Reduction: By armor and shield type
Saving Throw: d10 or 2d4

Battle Phase d8

Legends and Lore: As with dwarves and elves, the
gnomes passing through Crossroads come from a
settled land where certain traditions regarding the
races seem firmly entrenched. These small beings,
slighter than dwarves but with a kinship in
appearance — someway betwixt halfling and dwarf
one might say, with cherub-like features in the
youngest, but all wrinkled wisdom in the oldest.

Tinkerers, inventors, pioneers of science; part
engineer,                           part magician. Heroes familiar with
gnomish adventurers have grown fearful of their
potions and inventions, ofttimes as likely to cause
havoc to friend as to foe.

Those that have settled Ainerêve practice alchemy

— they seek the philosophers’ stone, though why
here                              rather than elsewhere I cannot say. I challenged
one once, saying ‘Surely the stone is the seeker’s
own will, used to turn the elements of his common
spirit into a soul of gold?’ but to this the gnome gave
only a cryptic smile and said no more.

Abilities and Powers: Gnomic magic centers on.
Gnomes                             use their own magical machinery, arcane
inventions, and potions that cause magical effects,
both for weal and woe. Every item should be given a
misfire chance — a probability of opposite or non-

action (5% to 20% — roll each time the invention,
potion,                           or other item is used).

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Good quality
weapons                               and armor are the norm, with everything
from flying clockwork planes to exploding gloves as
additional equipment; potions, elixirs, and strange
unguents are likely. Gnomes are often rich, and
sometimes envied; gold coins and gems are secreted
in belt and pouch (individual cache, 20–200 coins
and 10% chance of 1 magic item; domicile trove,
200–2000 coins and 30% chance of d3 magic items).

Goblin

Type: Minor

Threat Dice: Melee d6 ~ Natural d4 ~ Ranged d4
Hit Points 6 (3/3) [normal, small, mundane]
Damage Reduction: By armor or shield

Saving Throw: d4 to d8

Battle Phase d6 to d12

Abilities and Powers: Goblins lack any remarkable
skills,                               but grow into adulthood learning how to kill
with any implement they may find. They are
ruthless, lazy, greedy, and sadistic as a species,
growing as they do out of the nightmares of
humankind. They breed among their own kind, but
the first is said to have stalked out from the unsettled
lands.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Goblins normally
wear                            leather or hide armor. Favored weapon is the
hand axe or short sword. Individually a goblin’s
treasure amounts to little more than trinkets (1–6
coins and 1% chance of 1 minor magic item). If found
in a lair, a small cache (2–20 coins and 5% chance of
1 magic item).

Golem

Type: Standard to Legendary

Threat Dice: Natural 2d8 to 3d18 ~ Melee 2d6 to 3d14

~ Ranged 2d4 to 2d12 ~ Arcane 2d10 to 3d14

Extra Attacks: Possible elemental blasts equal to
main attack

Hit Points: 112 (28/84) to 135 (33/101) [tough, large,
preternatural; ×2]

Damage Reduction: d4 to d18 natural armor, plus
possible immunity to element

Saving Throw: d4 to 3d12

Battle Phase d6

Legends and Lore: A shell of stone and clay, large,
hulking,                          man-like. It is inscribed with runic marks,
glyphs, spells: secret names of God — and the devil
too? It is the work of a magician, often misguided;
kneeling before the unfinished construct, he
implores the powers of heaven and hell to give it life.
Yet it is the servants of Lilith most likely to enter
within, there to work the sinister will of their
mistress. The golem might be mindless or possessed
of a wicked spirit, and who can tell the difference?

For a seemingly mindless automaton, doing the
bidding                               of its master, may one day, at a time ripe for
wickedness, strike and act at Lilith’s will.

Abilities and Powers: Possessed of great strength
and                            durability, the golem is a dutiful servant in labor
or war, and can be set as a guard. One possessed by a
spirit of occult cruelty will act to bring chaos and
dishonor to all it has served. While so possessed, it
may gain demonic powers to harm and kill: an ability
to pass through walls, to mimic voices, to move
items by will, and to weave strange choking fogs, are
all recorded in De Rerum Horrida, a volume of weird
occult lore. Elemental golems, of ice, rock, earth,
lava, clay, etc., are known, and each will have an
additional power and immunity appropriate to the
element from which it is formed. Golems of metal,
crystal, and even diamond have been reported. The
flesh golem is the work of a necromancer, misguided
scientist, and almost certain to attract a stray soul. A

golem may be a near-unstoppable juggernaut, but it
is                              one possible to outrun, as surviving adventurers
have noted.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Armor levels as
appropriate                                 to the element or combination of
elements/materials from which the golem is formed.
Smashing fist strikes and leg stomps form the basis
of attack — additional harm and magical results may
ensue: fire, ice bursts, muddy entrapment, stunning,
etc.

Griffin

Type: Exceptional

Threat Dice: Natural 3d10 (beak and talons)

Extra Attacks: Hind lion claws 3d12 (contingent
attack,                        see below)

Hit Points: 45 (23/22) [normal, magical, Medium;

×1.5]

Damage Reduction: +2 (natural toughness)

Saving Throw: 2d6

Battle Phase d8 ground; d10 ftight

Legends and Lore: With the wings, forelimbs, and
head                                 of an eagle and the hindquarters of a lion, the
griffin is a fearsome combination of two mighty
predators. Their ears prick up, a sign of their near-
prescient senses. Griffins lair in mountainous homes
and whether by accident or design, their airborne
prides oft-times have aeries above deposits of gold,
so that a prospector can be guided to gold ore by
following their flight. This leads to conflict, as
griffins will not tolerate intruders in their hunting
ranges. Here lies the origin of the griffins’
enslavement by the Arimaspians; seeking gold,
plunder or mine, inevitably led the one-eyed reavers
into conflict with griffins; and sore woe came unto
the winged bird-lions when the Arimaspians learned
some occult method of binding them.

Abilities and Powers: Griffins see and hear with
great                             acuity. All a griffin’s senses, including those of
smell, vibration, and taste, are heightened so that it

354


is impossible to surprise one, unless magically
hidden.                              Beak and talon strike, backed by a hunting
bird’s accuracy and a lion’s ferocious strength. A
griffin that strikes with bird-like forelimbs can,
thereafter, bunch up its lion-like rear limbs and
make a devastating clawing strike as it holds its prey
fast (whenever the main attack exceeds the
defender’s Active DP).

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Only incidental
wealth                         will be found in a griffin aerie, left among
victims’ remains.

Hag

Type: Standard

Threat Dice: Arcane 2d10 ~ Natural d6 ~ Melee d4 ~
Ranged d4

Extra Attacks: Critter swarm (2d6, zero Challenge
Die)

Hit Points: 68 (51/17) [fast, medium, preternatural;

×2]

Damage Reduction: None.
Saving Throw: 2d10
Battle Phase d6

Legends and Lore: These horrid spirits in the form of
crones stalk the Forest of Meath and are found in
Maedoen too; typical witch-like women with black
teeth, stony eyed, that seek to lead mortal children
away to feast upon their blood and bone. The hags
have other objectives too: they form covens, weave
spells, and some have ranged from their native
homes into other lands to increase wickedness and
spread their sinister power across the realm.

Abilities and Powers: Each hag cradles a basket in
her                               arm; ’neath its lid are horrors: from the basket
the hag can pluck forth imps, spiders, serpents,
bugs, even goblins and other hateful things. Fear the
hag, for she carries evil wherever she goes. In
addition, each hag can perform magical spells and
workings with a Harm or Afflict effect from the
Sorcery and Hieraticism paths, and if in the company

of twelve of her sisters, a full coven, the power of
such                                is doubled — trebled on certain occult and
accursed nights in the sabbatic calendar of dark
wizardry. The swarm a hag plucks from her basket is
as below:

Critter swarm: The number of critters summoned is
equal to the result of the ability check, and each
creature has 1 threat point, 1 hit point, and 0 active
defense. The creatures act as one (minor) group,
with Prowess rank equal to the hag’s. See Swarm
Summoning.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Hags may have
jewels                               and treasures, magic items, and cursed
objects hidden in their baskets (200–2000 coins
value and 30% chance of d3 magic items). If her life
is seriously endangered, one will offer to trade goods
for it (plucking forth cursed objects first, of course).

Halfling

Type: Minor to legendary

Threat Dice: Melee d6 ~ Ranged d6 ~ Natural d4
Hit Points: 6 (3/3) [normal, small, mundane]
Damage Reduction: By armor or shield type
Saving Throw: d10

Battle Phase d8

Legends and Lore: Halflings are a small, resourceful
folk                             known for their dual nature—shy and reclusive
yet surprisingly adventurous when the need arises.
They are often mistaken for Shee near the region of
Psarmorum, leading them to live as outlaws to avoid
persecution by the Templars. Despite their small
stature, halflings are known to raid dragon lairs and
are skilled in stealth and survival. They have a strong
sense of community and value their homes and
families above all else.

Abilities and Powers: Halflings possess an innate
knack                               for stealth, making them difficult to detect by
larger foes. They are adept at moving quietly and can
hide easily in natural environments. Their small size
grants them agility, allowing them to dodge attacks

355


BESTIARY


and escape from dangerous situations with relative
ease.                             While they are not naturally inclined toward
combat, when cornered, halflings can be surprisingly
fierce, using whatever tools or weapons are at hand
to defend themselves.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Halflings typically
arm                          themselves with small weapons, such as
daggers, slings, or short swords. They wear light
armor, often made from leather or other materials
that do not hinder their movement. Halflings are
known to keep small treasures hidden away, often in
the form of coins, gems, or items of sentimental
value. A typical halfling home might contain 20–200
coins and a 10% chance of a minor magic item. Due
to their nomadic tendencies when threatened, these
treasures are often well hidden and protected by
simple but effective traps.

Harpy

Type: Standard

Threat Dice: Natural 2d6 (talons)

Hit Points 24 (18/6) [fast, medium, preternatural;

×2]

Damage Reduction: None

Saving Throw: d20 versus Sorcery; else d8

Battle Phase d8

Legends and Lore: Harpies are infamous for their
deceptive                        appearance and wicked nature. Often
found in isolated mountain ranges or along
treacherous coastlines, harpies lure their victims
with their magical ability to appear as exotically
attractive winged maidens, easily mistaken for
angels. The transformation is so convincing that
even the most seasoned adventurers may be fooled.
However, their true form is that of a vile and
predatory creature, half-woman and half-bird, with
a shrieking voice that can unsettle the bravest souls.

Abilities and Powers: Harpies are equipped with
potent                           illusion magic, particularly the Full Body
Illusion spell, which allows them to disguise their

true form as a beautiful maiden with wings. This
illusion                            can be cast without requiring any tests,
making it an almost effortless deception. The
harpy’s natural attack involves both vicious claws
and a paralyzing screech that can leave its victims
vulnerable. Those who fall prey to a harpy’s allure
often find themselves caught in her talons, carried
off to her lair to meet a grisly end.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Harpies do not
wield                            weapons or wear armor, relying instead on
their natural abilities and magical deceptions. They
may carry small treasures, often trinkets taken from
previous victims. The typical harpy nest contains a
small cache of 50-200 coins, and there is a 10%
chance of finding a minor magic item, usually
something related to enhancing deception or
illusion.

Horse

Type: Minor to Standard

Threat Dice: Natural d10 (riding horse) to 2d12
(warhorse)

Hit Points: 10 to 24 [normal, large, mundane; ×2]
Damage                         Reduction: By any armor (barding) up to d12
Saving Throw: d4 to d8 to 8

Battle Phase d10

Legends and Lore: Horses are important in any
medieval                          society, and even in lands where magic
functions, nothing beats their reliability and
strength. Magic remains taxing, and the effects
relatively short-lived, so most folk still need
conventional modes of transportation. The average
riding horse can carry 250 pounds thirty miles in
eight hours.

Abilities and Powers: Horses can also be used in
combat,                              and warhorses typically have a higher ability
to deal damage

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Horses, especially
warhorses,                              may be fitted with armor (barding),

356


granting general protection, with the usual armor
types.

Hunting Dog

Type: Minor

Threat Dice: Natural d6 (bite)

Damage Reduction: None

Hit Points: 6 [normal, small, mundane]

Saving Throw: d4 to d8 to 8

Battle Phase d8

Legends and Lore: Nobles often use hunting dogs in
sport, or when tracking down escaped prisoners.

They’re either scent hounds like coon hounds, or
sight hounds like pointers.

Abilities and Powers: Hunting dogs can follow even
the                           faintest scent trails, with a roll of 3d12, or spot
small quarry (including Swipes) with the same level
of ability. Their hearing is also very good, with a
default Perception check of d6+4.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Most owners don’t
fit                             their hunting dogs with armor, or allow them to
carry treasures.

Hydra

Type: Standard, Exceptional, or Legendary (4, 8, or
12                             heads)

Threat Dice: Natural 2d12 to 3d20 (main head’s bite,
or                        constriction)

Extra Attacks: 2d6 per extra head

Hit Points: 48 (12/36) [tough, large, magical; ×2]

Damage Reduction: d6 (tough hide)

Saving Throw: d6

Battle Phase d4

Legends and Lore: The hydra is a water serpent with
many heads that often hunts on land. If stretched
out, in length it is like that of two men. Its
constrictor-like thick serpent trunk breaks into
multiple ophidian heads, each with venomous jaws.

Abilities and Powers: Able both to constrict and bite,
the                             hydra is a fearsome foe. Multiple toxins can be
found in a single specimen, so bites from one head
may cause paralysis, from another somnolence,
while a third induces a berserk frenzy against the
victim’s companions, and so forth.

While some hydras can be killed by decapitation of
each                                head or chopping through the central trunk by a
prodigious feat of strength, others (1 in 6) will grow
d3 fresh heads each time a head is severed, thus
making them harder to kill with each telling blow.

Fire might be used to cauterize the neck stumps and
prevent re-growth… or so legends say…

Poison: Any hydra head’s bite penetrating active
defenses                            forces a Saving Throw versus the attack
roll, else victim suffers a poison effect. Usually this is
another instant d10 poison damage (save vs.

Fortitude). Some (1 in 4) hydras have a random effect
per                             head, e.g. roll d12: 1–5 poison, 6 GM’s whim, 7
stun, 8 blind, 9 paralyze, 10 incapacitate, 11 confuse,
12 terrorize (save vs. Fortitude or as per magical
affliction).

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Often found as
guardians                              of (un)holy sites, the hydra might be
tasked with protecting wealth, or some sacred object
of power (hoard: 1000–10,000 coins value and 40%
chance of 4 magic items).

Lilith

Type: Legendary (avatar)

Threat Dice: Arcane 3d18 ~ Melee 3d10 ~ Natural 2d8

Extra Attacks: Extra spell action

Hit Points: 135 (68/67) [normal, supernatural,

Damage Reduction: By armor and shield type;
immunity to mundane weaponry

BESTIARY


Legends and Lore: Lilith, Mother of the Night, first
woman,                             creatrix, elder sister of Eve. Embittered
against heaven, weary of hell, she is wed in unholy
union with Baphomet. She seeks to free him from the
constricting webs of heaven and hell to grant him
ultimate power and freedom, and with it the end of
all, the coming of night, the journey across the abyss
and ultimately rebirth. She is the Whore of Babylon;
dressed in red, a lion at her right hand, a many-
headed dragon behind her. Hidden from sight, first
wife of Adam, the true Sophia, Lilith has existed
through countless incarnations, trapped in the
warped matter of reality, downtrodden, forgotten,
humiliated, accursed; in Ainerêve she seeks the
source of her suffering; is she born in the mind of
man? Have all her pains been mortal dreams? Was
Eden first here or on Earth?

Abilities and Powers: Lilith chooses to appear in the
guise                                 of a demonic vampire queen, beautiful beyond
reason. She inspires a charmed lust that forces men,
and some women too, to seek her approval and
voluntarily do her will (mesmerizing command). She
is a mistress of all dark magics, can heal herself by
drinking blood, take on the form of wolf, bat, or
screech owl, and put those she talks to into a
submissive trance (entrance).

Despite appearances to the contrary, Lilith is not
truly                            undead, she is a manifest spiritual entity, and,
so certain drug-maddened sages argue in the Scrolls
of Licentia, mother to all living things. Immune to all
but the most highly enchanted weapons, Lilith’s
avatar is still, like a vampire, vulnerable to wooden
stakes, submersion in running water, and
decapitation.

Extra spell action: Choose 1 extra spell action, 1
battle phase after initial attack — mesmerizing
command, any Mysticism or Hieraticism spell at

+d10 (3d18+d10).

Mesmersizing command: Inspires charmed lust in
susceptible mortals: Challenge Die 0, control mind
effect using 3d18; save Fortitude → Willpower

Entrance: Induce trance state (semi-conscious until
stimulus or 10 minutes) by talking uninterrupted to
mortal for one round, Challenge Die d10 effect using
3d18; save Fortitude → Willpower.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Lilith’s avatar can
conjure any item for her use. She will be clad in
valuable finery, usually of a gothic bent, and carry
many mystical and magical objects (small trove:
100–600 coins, but 20% chance of d10 legendary
magic items).

Lilith’s Daughters

Type: Standard

Threat Dice: Arcane 2d10 ~ Melee d10 ~ Natural d8 ~
Ranged d6

Extra Attacks: Extra spell action

Hit Points: 40 (20/20) [normal, preternatural,
medium;                      ×2]

Damage Reduction: +2 (preternatural toughness) [ I
wonder if I should present hit point increase for
anything but Legendary and then the die type for
legendary? Like +2 / 1d4? )

Saving Throw: d10

Battle Phase d8

Legends and Lore: The Daughters of Lilith are
vampiric succubi, visions of passion and lust but
with a touch of terror — their eyes are without
pupils, and their fingers end in claws.

Abilities and Powers: As with their dark mistress, all
the                          vampire’s classic powers belong to Lilith’s
daughters, and yet they too are flesh-clothed spirits
rather than undead entities. Each can wield dark
magic and otherwise has Lilith’s powers in a reduced
capacity but will often choose to attack with her bite
and iron-hard talons rather than rely on
enchantments.

Extra spell action: Choose 1 extra spell action, 1
battle                           phase after initial attack — mesmerizing
command, any Mysticism or Hieraticism spell (the

358


last two at Challenge Die d2 using a d10 if other than
a                             Harm effect spell).

Mesmerizing command: Inspires charmed lust in
susceptible mortals: Challenge Die d4 control mind
effect using d10; save Fortitude → Willpower.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Usually, each has a
small cache (2–20 coins and 5% chance of 1 magic
item), but their mistress may have set them to guard
a greater treasure.

Orc

Type: Minor to legendary

Threat Dice: Natural d8 ~ Melee d6 ~ Ranged d4
Hit Points: 8 (4/4) [normal, medium, mundane]
Damage Reduction: By armor or shield

Battle Phase d6

Legends and Lore: Orcs are stupid, barbaric, tribal
creatures.                             Bigger and meaner than goblins, they
enjoy robbing human villages and terrorizing every
living thing.

Abilities and Powers: Orcs are very strong, capable of
feats of strength at 2d8, and have a keen sense of
smell (Perception d10).

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Orcs usually wield
inferior                             axes and swords to spread mayhem, and don
hide or leather armor. Their shields often provide
only 1 point of DR, even if medium-sized, for they
are not known for good workmanship. They may
possess trinkets (1–6 coins and 1% chance of 1 minor
magic item), or for exceptional specimens as much
as a small cache (2–20 coins and 5% chance of 1
magic item).

Peri

Type: Minor to legendary

Threat Dice: Arcane d10 ~ Melee d8 ~ Ranged d6 ~
Natural d4

Hit Points: 10 (7/3) [fast, medium, magical; ×1.5]
Damage Reduction: By armor and shield type
Saving Throw: 2d4

Battle Phase d10 (d12 in ftight)

Legends and Lore: It is with a heavy heart I speak of
the                              peris, for they unwittingly spread evil and fear on
the borders of our land of Maedoen, persecuting
those of ancient wisdom and tradition by order of
their master, Lord Sol Invictus. Beautiful, with
sapphire eyes, bird-like wings, and the passion of a
young star, a peri is at once angelic and formidable.

Nathal of the Seelie court insists that the near-
immortal                             peris are not evil, despite their incursions
into Maedoen. Originally summoned as servant
angels of Psarmorum, they were and are willing to
fight the powers of Hell. In turn, some of the ablest
knights of Psarmorum have gone to aid their battles
in their own realm, so the bond is strong. However,
of those peris that linger here long, many have
grown suspicious of the Order of Chaplains’ good
intentions, as they encounter more of the good
people of Maedoen. Peri defectors are welcomed by
the high elves, usually joining the Seelie Court, and

359


BESTIARY


are protected by the Guardians Guild. Although
resembling                              and welcomed by high elves, peris prefer
wyld elves’ company, for they are more impulsive
and passionate, which matches the peris’ fiery
sensibilities. Called rogue angels here in Crossroads,
peris often hide their wings when traveling through
the kingdoms of Maedoen for fear they’d be assumed
to be spies.

Abilities and Powers: Peris are adept magic users,
preferring                             the Elementalism and Hieraticism paths
of magic and focusing on the spells from the Energy
element and with the Restore effect repectively. They
also possess the power of flight, their base prowess
rank increasing a full die rank when in flight.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Peris wear light
armor,                           often magical as provided by the Church of
Psarmorum, and usually prefer ranged spells to
missile weapons. Up close, the peris are capable
fighters and will often conjure their weapons as
needed. Like elves, peris don’t like to travel with a
heavy burden, though many keep a cache in their
homes: 100–200 coins and 20% chance of 1 magic
item.

Raptor

Type: Minor

Threat Dice: Natural d8+1 (beak or talons)
Hit                    Points: 8 [normal, small, mundane]
Damage Reduction: None

Battle Phase d16

Legends and Lore: Raptors are birds of prey and hunt
game for their trainers, either called falconers (for
falcons) or austringers (for hawks). Some raptors are
trained for battle and are more than hunting hawks,
it is said. They are greatly feared for their ferocity
and their ability to tear their enemies to pieces.

Abilities and Powers: Those birds of prey trained to
attack or retrieve are highly valued. They have a
“static” speed score of 16, which means they rarely

lose the initiative in a fight and are incredibly fast
when flying.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: None.

Sacred Ophidian Sisterhood of Seven
Serpents Entwined

Type: Standard

Threat Dice: Ranged 2d12 ~ Arcane 2d10 ~ Melee 2d8

~ Natural 2d6

Extra Attacks: Petrifying gaze or poison bite
(contingent attack, see below)

Hit Points: 48 (36/12) [fast, preternatural, medium;

×2]

Damage Reduction: By armor or shield

Saving Throw: 2d6

Battle Phase d8

Legends and Lore: The Sacred Ophidian Sisterhood
of                             Seven Serpents Entwined is a mysterious and
feared faction, often set apart from true monsters.
Formed by women from war-afflicted communities
who have lost everything, the Sisterhood recruits
young girls and women seeking vengeance. Their
serpentine tattoos, which are said to move and coil
under the skin, are both a symbol of their
membership and a source of their magical power.

The Sisterhood is known for its strict discipline,
secretive                           rituals, and unwavering dedication to their
cause. They are often involved in shadowy dealings
and covert operations, manipulating events from
behind the scenes.

Abilities and Powers: Each member of the Sisterhood
is                             highly skilled in both martial and arcane arts.

Their primary magical abilities are tied to the
serpentine                            tattoos that adorn their bodies, allowing
them to summon serpents, inflict venomous curses,
and manipulate others with hypnotic charm. These
abilities are enhanced when members work in
unison, reflecting the Sisterhood’s philosophy of
strength through unity. The Sisterhood’s leader,
known as the High Serpent, is particularly powerful,

360


capable of casting spells that affect entire regions or
armies.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: The Sisterhood’s
members                           typically wield ceremonial daggers,
imbued with venom that can paralyze or kill their
foes. They favor light, flexible armor that allows for
swift, fluid movements, often crafted from the skins
of serpents. The Sisterhood’s treasure is usually kept
in secret caches, guarded by both mundane and
magical means. These caches might include rare
alchemical ingredients, powerful relics, and wealth
taken from those who have wronged them. While
individual members may carry small amounts of coin
or minor magical items, the true riches of the
Sisterhood are hidden away, accessible only to those
who prove their loyalty.

Sea Serpent

Type: Legendary

Threat Dice: Natural 2d20 (crushing attack)

Extra Attack: d14+24 (bite)

Hit Points: 48 (12/36) [tough, preternatural,
gargantuan;                  ×3.5]

Damage Reduction: +5 / d10 (thick, scaly hide)

Saving Throw: 2d10

Battle Phase d10 in the sea

Legends and Lore: Sea serpents are the bane of the
oceans                               and great lakes of the world. Those who travel
by sea had better keep a thaumaturge on board who
can summon the wind and speed their travel before
such a beast appears. Rare though they may be, just
one of these death-dealing beasts quickly sinks ships
and their treasures. In the Murex Scrolls, it is written
that one of these beasts, known of old as Leviathan,
has lived so long that it nears twice the size of its
lesser kindred, but this is surely a myth.

Abilities and Powers: Sea serpents can capsize a
large                               galley in only five rounds, crushing the hull like
matchsticks. If attacked or hungry, they will bite at
the attackers as well.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: None

Sentinel

Type: Standard to Legendary

Threat Dice: Any attack type, 2d to 3d, any die rank

Extra Attack: up to 3 (2d or 3d, any die rank)

Hit Points: 8 to 240 [any constitution, any size, any
nature; up to ×5]

Saving Throw: d12 to 3d12

Battle Phase d8+

Legends and Lore: All places, sacred or profane, have
their                            guardians. Sometimes this is non-sentient
protection, such as a glyph or runic trap, but often
it’s a creature summoned or created to guard
something important. Because a sentinel can be just
about any imposing creature or something unique,
the GM is free to tailor a sentinel (or sentinels) to
suit the encounter.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Weapons and armor
depending on the particular sentinel. Treasure
guarded ranges from trinkets to the equivalent of a
dragon’s hoard (wildly varied, 1 to 60,000 in coin
value, 1 to 50% or greater chance of magic items).

Shee (Fay or Faerie)

Minor Shee

Type: Minor Fay/Faerie

Threat Dice (TD):

Arcane: D10 (glamor)

Ranged: D8
Melee: D6
Unarmed: D4

Hit Points (HP): 15 to 25 [Constitution: Any, Size:
Miniscule to Large, Nature: Preternatural; HP
Multiplier: ×1.5 to ×2.5]

Armor Rating (AR): D4 to D12

Wealth and Treasure (WAT): 100–1000 coins value
in                            gems or “arboreal” art

Notes: Minor Shee are lesser faerie creatures, skilled
in                            glamor for distraction or stunning.

Legends and Lore: Often found in hidden glens,
enchanted                          forests, and mystical groves, the Minor
Shee represent the lowest tier of the Shee hierarchy.
They are known for their ethereal beauty and
mischievous nature, traits that are both captivating
and unsettling to those who encounter them.

Frequently aligned with either the Seelie or Unseelie
Courts,                            these beings serve as messengers, spies, or
distractions for more powerful Fay. The duality of
their nature reflects the unpredictable whimsy of the
Fay, where moments of grace can quickly turn to acts
of cruelty.

Abilities and Powers: Skilled in the art of glamor,
Minor                              Shee can distract or stun their opponents with
ease. Their ability to shift size—from minuscule to
large—makes them elusive and difficult to combat,
especially when they use their illusions to create
confusion. Their agility and small stature also aid
them in evading danger and manipulating their
surroundings to their advantage.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure (WAT): Minor Shee
typically do not wear armor, preferring to rely on
their agility and magical abilities for protection.

They might carry small, enchanted trinkets or
weapons,                              such as tiny daggers or bows crafted from
enchanted wood. Their treasures, often hidden in
secretive groves, usually consist of gems or “nature-
inspired crafts” valued between 100 to 1000 coins.

Standard Shee

Type: Standard Fay/Faerie

Threat Dice (TD):

Arcane: 2D6 (glamor)

Ranged: 2D4
Melee: D8
Unarmed: D4

Hit Points (HP): 48 to 80 [Constitution: Any, Size:
Miniscule to Large, Nature: Preternatural; HP
Multiplier: ×1.5 to ×2.5]

Armor Rating (AR): D4 to D12

Wealth and Treasure (WAT): 100–1000 coins value
in                            gems or “arboreal” art

Legends and Lore: Ascending the hierarchy, we
encounter                              the Standard Shee, who embody the more
common faerie folk within the Fay courts. These
Shee often align themselves with either the Seelie
Court, known for its harmony with nature and
benevolent magic, or the Unseelie Court, which
embraces darker practices, including necromancy.
Guardians of the Fertile Glens—areas rich in life and
magical energy—Standard Shee protect these sacred
spaces with unwavering devotion, punishing those
who dare defile them.

Abilities and Powers: Standard Shee possess the
ability                              to shape-shift, allowing them to assume
various forms for deception, concealment, or
combat. Their glamor magic is powerful enough to
manipulate perceptions, crafting illusions that can
confuse or mesmerize their enemies. Proficient in
Nature, Life, Illusion, and Plant magic, Standard
Shee are formidable defenders of their territories,
summoning the forces of nature or obscuring their
enemies’ senses with ease.

362


Weapons, Armor, and Treasure (WAT): Standard
Shee                               often wield weapons made from natural
materials, such as bows crafted from enchanted trees
or swords forged from moonlight silver. Their
armor, if worn, is typically light and made from
leaves or bark, enchanted to provide protection
without hindering movement. Their treasures are
hidden deep within their groves or arboreal palaces
and consist of rare gems, plants, or “nature-inspired
crafts” worth between 500 to 1500 coins, reflecting
their higher status compared to their minor
counterparts.

Shee Lord

Type: Exceptional (Fay Nobility)

Threat Dice: Arcane 3d12 ~ Melee 2d8 ~

Hit Points: 72 (48/24) [fast,

Damage Reduction: By any
armor worn

Saving Throw: d12

Battle Phase: d12

Notes: Shee Lords are
formidable          faerie nobility,
possessing potent glamor
and command over faerie
magic.

Legends and Lore: The Shee
Lords                are the aristocracy of the

Fay, ruling with a captivating blend of

grace and terrifying power. They embody the duality
of                                the Seelie and Unseelie Courts, with some aligned
with the light and others steeped in shadow. Revered
and feared in equal measure, Shee Lords can be
benevolent protectors or ruthless adversaries,
depending on their whims. Their unearthly beauty is
said to ensnare the minds of mortals, and their
presence commands awe and trepidation. They are
often found in their arboreal palaces, magical
fortresses grown from the very heart of Fertile Glens,

which serve as both their source of power and a
reflection of their will.

Abilities and Powers: A Shee Lord is a master of
glamor                               and illusion, capable of bending reality and
perception with mere thought. Their magic extends
beyond mere deception, allowing them to control
natural forces, summon creatures of the wild, and
reshape landscapes to their desires. In combat, they
are deadly, wielding both spell and blade with
unparalleled skill. Their glamor is not just an illusion
but a manifestation of their power, capable of
enchanting entire courts and bending even the
strongest wills to their desires.

The Price of Power: Though Shee Lords seem almost
godlike                          in their domains, their power

comes at a cost. Some whisper that
their                   ties to the mortal realm

weaken with each passing
century,         requiring offerings

of beauty, artistry, or even life
force                 to maintain their
splendor. This dependence may
fuel their capricious nature,
driving them to acts of great
generosity or terrible cruelty in

an endless cycle of need and
fulfillment. Mortals, such as the

Eldritch Man, may find themselves
in                  service to the Shee, their lives

extended and powers enhanced in
exchange for their loyalty and life force.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure (WAT): Shee Lords
often                             wield enchanted weapons, heirlooms passed
down through generations, each imbued with
powerful magic. Their armor, if worn, is of the finest
craftsmanship, often appearing as part of their
glamor rather than physical protection. The
treasures of a Shee Lord are vast and ancient,
including relics of immense power, rare gems, and
artifacts hidden deep within their arboreal palaces.
These palaces, grown from the very trees they

363


BESTIARY


inhabit, are living structures, their halls winding
through                         massive trunks and canopies, hidden from
those uninvited. The wealth within is guarded not
only by enchantments and traps but by the very
forest itself, loyal to the Shee Lord’s will.

Source of Evil

Saving Throw: d10+10

Battle Phase Battle Phase 1 default or d20+10 for
random initiative

Legends and Lore: The Source of Evil, known by
many                        names—Satan, the Accuser, Lucifer—was
once a radiant angel. Even now, he can appear with
an image of purity, though it is a cold, cynical purity
filled with self-righteousness and pride. At other
times, he takes on the bestial figure of folklore,
horned and tailed: the Devil. Satan is wary of
Baphomet, the usurper, and his consort Lilith, both
of whom have turned their attention to Ainerêve.

Initially, Satan viewed Baphomet’s interest in this
dream                            realm with disdain, assuming the Sabbatic
Goat sought only to rule in dreams. But a dread fear
soon gripped Satan’s black heart—what if this realm
of dreams was his true origin?

Satan, once a persecutor of mankind, now fears
that                                he is their creation, a miscarried spawn of their
darkest fears and loathing. The possibility that
Baphomet and Lilith seek to reshape Earth through
Ainerêve’s dream realms fills Satan with a sense of
dread. To counter this, Satan has reached out to
Heaven, and together they have woven a web of
energies across Ainerêve, a net of power meant to
bind Baphomet. Both Heaven and Hell now watch

with bated breath, waiting to see if they, too, are but
dreams or mere facsimiles of a greater reality.

Abilities and Powers: Satan’s powers are vast,
bordering                                on omniscience and omnipotence—at
least, so he believes, and perhaps he is right. When
the Avatar of Evil manifests in the mortal realm, it
often toys with humanity, presenting itself as a
daring alternative to societal norms. But beneath the
aristocratic facade lies a wrathful, hateful being, the
complete antithesis of love. In combat, Satan is
overconfident, often allowing vulnerabilities in his
avatar form to taunt his attackers, as though mortal
combat were merely a game. And to Satan, it is—a
game in which he is the master.

Satan’s avatar regenerates 10 HP per battle phase
and                            gains temporary hit points equal to the damage
it inflicts on a target’s Passive Defense. Even if his
avatar is slain, it regenerates from dust after four
rounds, but only in Hell.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Satan’s avatar can
wield any item, treasure, or device, including those
of immense power. The treasure hoards associated
with him are vast, potentially equivalent to a
dragon’s hoard, valued between 10,000 and 60,000
coins, with a 100% chance of containing d8 magic
items.

Specter (or Limbo Spirit)

Type: Standard (undead)

Threat Dice: Natural d10 (+d8 non-physical harm via
spectral touch).

Hit Points: 25 (13/12) [normal, supernatural,
medium;                    ×2.5]

Damage Reduction: Immune to non-magical attacks
and                           Energy Elementalism spells

Saving Throw: d6

Battle Phase d10+12

Legends and Lore: Specters, ghosts, and spirits act
as                             guides, allies giving clues to the living, wandering
souls, or guardians of holy or unholy places..

364


Abilities and Powers: These ghosts seem almost
solid,                                if not for a faint shimmering, but can turn
invisible at will. Striking at one with non-magical
weapons is pointless, as they are immune to such.
They are also immune to Energy attacks since they
exist as (spiritual) energy, the “fifth essence.”
Thaumaturges can unravel a spirit’s manifestation
with non-physical harm spells, especially entropic
spells, which inflict double damage. The weapons of
a limbo spirit appear real but are actually dense
energy fields. Their weapons can be used to parry,
but ghosts don’t often use such tactics. All damage
from their attacks bypasses non-magical armor.

Spectral touch: The spirit’s extra non-physical
damage                               die, whether delivered by touch or weapon,
is preternatural and can be blocked by armor — but
only roll the extra damage die if the base Natural
threat roll exceeds the target’s chosen active
defense. Some specters have extra powers consistent
with their nature.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: These spirits don’t
carry                               real equipment or treasure.

Swipes (Astral Footpads)

Type: Minor (extraplanar)

Threat Dice: Ranged d10 (+d8 if using “kestros”) ~

Extra Attacks: Astral snap d6+d4 (by touch)

Hit Points: 20 (10/10) [normal, preternatural,

Damage Reduction: d4 astral field (phasing in and
out)

Saving Throw: d10; immune to teleportation and
summoning

Battle Phase d12+4

Legends and Lore: Small and fleet of foot, swipes
look                                like small, fuzzy monkeys with huge eyes. As a
species, they are mostly thieves with the most
annoying hideout possible: the astral plane. They can
shift at will into unsettled territory. These “astral

footpads” are capable of traveling great distances,
teleporting                             upon mental command.

A swipe will steal a coin purse, and then with a brief
shimmering and a “pop” sound, it’s gone. They are
as intelligent as humans and organized into tribal,
nomadic societies that invade small towns, quickly
depleting food sources and other items, then moving
on.

Abilities and Powers: A swipe gets +4 to initiative to
increase Battle Phase or random initiative roll (see
Chapter 3, Combat). They use small weapons only
and are expert dart throwers (using a “kestros”
sling). Swipes can see in total darkness. Their
teleportation ability may be used once per round for
short distances and as a natural defense (d4 damage
reduction), but if the swipe shifts into the astral
plane for longer than a battle phase, it cannot return
for d2 rounds (it must get reoriented). They speak
the common language, which allows them to
converse with travelers of all sorts, and are easily
bribed. Unbeknownst to most, the swipes are experts
at navigating the chaos of unsettled lands. Once a
place is described to them, they can guide anybody
there in a short amount of time.

Astral snap: Once per round, a swipe can touch a
creature                              and send its spirit into the astral plane, but
only for a split second. The victim’s spirit snaps back
into the body with a jarring, disorienting effect
(d6+d4 stun effect vs. Fortitude → Willpower →
Resistance).

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Swipes are strange
creatures,                              as their bodies exist almost in two places
at once: the astral and the settled realms. They have
some natural resistance to normal forms of damage
and get a d4 damage reduction against every physical
attack. They are immune to teleportation and
summoning spells if they are unwilling to be affected
by them (though they can choose to be summoned,
hitching a ride to adventure, no conjurer has figured
out how to control or command one). If found
traveling alone, a swipe may only have a trinket or

two (1–6 coins and 1% chance of 1 minor magic

Troll

Type: Standard

Threat Dice: Natural 2d12 ~ Melee 2d8 ~ Ranged 2d8

~ Arcane 2d8

Hit Points: 60 (30/30) [normal, magical, huge; ×2.5]

Damage Reduction: +2 / d4

Saving Throw: 2d4

Battle Phase d10

Legends and Lore: A hulking creature with black
pitiless                              eyes over a huge angular nose, and small
ears, a troll is a creature with ancestors born from
the primordial earth, and is attuned to natural stone.

Abilities and Powers: They can create effects
mirroring                          those of earth elementalists. Powers (as
the spells) are Minor Earthquake, Fissure, Earth
Merge, Earth Strike.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Trolls can use large
weapons, but usually prefer to rend and tear with
bestial strength. An individual troll may have
incidental treasure, such as a magical arrow used as a
toothpick, but a troll lair will usually contain a
treasure trove: 200–2000 coins and 30% chance of
d3 magic items.

Saving Throw: 2d12

Battle Phase d12

Legends and Lore: Several types of this horrid
undead                             parasite exist, from zombie-like corpse-
things shuffling in search of blood to highly magical
specimens able to maintain a semblance of humanity

— sometimes with an enticing charisma. Thus one
might encounter a seductress, fanged and sultry,
reminiscent of Lilith’s brood, with attendant
vampiric horrors that are obviously dead: things
risen but recently from the grave. Some vampires
choose to revere Satan, some Baphomet, and not a
few regard Lilith as their creatrix. Many display a
self-assured disdain for all, as they term them, so-
called and self-proclaimed deities.

Abilities and Powers: In Ainerêve, where every
folktale                             becomes a reality, a realm’s cultural base
will dictate the vampire’s powers and vulnerabilities.
Typical are powers of charm that can fascinate and
disarm a foe, the ability to fly, either in human or bat
form, shape-changing to bat or wolf. Some can take
on the form of a mist and flow ’neath doors or
through cracks; all can drink blood, regenerating and
thriving upon it. Some can only enter an abode if
invited, are repelled by garlic or holy symbols, burn
in the sun, expire beneath the water, and die only if
staked or perhaps beheaded.

Vampiric bite: The vampire rolls a d16 versus the
target's                            Strength specialty in Prowess to grapple,
and upon success, bites the victim, which has a
stunning effect (no Challenge Die for the vampire).
Once grappled, stunned or not, the victim takes d6
blood loss per round directly to passive defense hit
points. Although stunning is a physical affliction, the
save to break the effect (versus the vampire's
original grapple roll) is Willpower (Fortitude),
allowed initially, and once per round. Once stunning
is eliminated, an opposed roll of Fortitude with
Strength may let the victim break free.

Hypnotic gaze: If the vampire concentrates and
gazes                              into its victim’s eyes, it can create a mind
control effect (zero Challenge Die; the vampire rolls
2d12 versus the target’s Willpower).

366


Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Grave goods for
some,                               for others all the finery of an aristocrat —
much depends upon the vampire’s goals, its mode of
operating, and its need, or not, to acquire material
power (treasure is typically a trove: 200–2000 coins
and 30% chance of d3 magic items).

Werewolf

Type: Exceptional

Threat Dice: Natural 3d8+8 (bite, claw, punch) ~
Melee d10+8 ~Ranged d6

Hit Points: 80 (40/40) [normal, medium, magical;

×2]

Damage Reduction: Immune to normal weapons
except                            magic and silver

Saving Throw: 2d4

Battle Phase d8 human or d12 wolf

Legends and Lore: As with the vampire, to which it
bears a degree of kinship, the werewolf is shaped by
Ainerêve’s dream-reality. In some realms, it is
undead; in others, an accursed human who has
donned, willingly or not, a cruelly enchanted belt
that forces wolf-form upon its wearers. Some
werewolves appear as ravenous man-wolves, a
bipedal mixture of man and wolf; in others, the
were-creature comes as an exemplary wolf —
bigger, fiercer, swifter than its kin, but a wolf
nonetheless. In most cases, it is a living thing, a
human that becomes a blood-hungry hunter of the
night at the time of the full moon.

Abilities and Powers: It has all the wolf’s abilities,
and                                its bite may spread lycanthropy. Fearsomely
strong and agile, with a matchless ferocity, it may be
vulnerable to silver and otherwise unharmed by
weaponry. It will only use melee weapons in
humanoid form.

Weapons, Armor, and Treasure: Usually none, save
that                             which it possesses naturally in human forms. In
some realms, skinning the werewolf and donning its
hide will allow the wearer himself to assume wolfish
guise. Often, the werewolf drops all its gear when

367

assuming wolf form — although some, in a half-
man,                         half-wolf state, maintain possession of
weapons, armor, and other accouterments (a small
trove: 100–600 coins and 20% chance of D2 magic
items).

And thus we come to the end of this bestiary, and may it
bring knowledge and help to all its readers. Remember,
the written word is only as valuable as its source, and I,
Signoret, can vouch only that I have tried to garner the
truth of all herein reported. One more caveat, Ainerêve is
a world of dreams and dreams shift and change — be
careful of everything, depend upon nothing, and at all
times, except that which you least expect.


Gods of
Ainerêve

In Ainerêve, only a few gods hold sway, with myths
distinct from Earth’s. In Maedoen, the Celtic gods

BESTIARY

great king of Enwys, chosen by the moon goddess
Arianrhod                          herself. It is said she was then charged
with imparting the sacred druidical secrets to the
first Sisters. Yet, the current tradition, requiring a
male shee to impregnate the king's wife, casts doubt
on this legend, despite its veracity. Brigit's devotees
believe in fostering harmony between the shee and


Dagda, Arawn, Brigit, Cernunnos, The Morrigan, and

Math Mathonwy are most revered. Dalmavand
honors                             Norse and Anglo-Saxon gods like Baldur,
Odin, Thor, Loki, and Eostre, while Psarmorum
worships Sol Invictus, with Luna and Astra as lesser
aspects.

Arawn: God of Death

Arawn, the god of death and justice, is the arbiter of
all                            mortals’ fates in the afterlife. He rules over the
enigmatic Otherworld, Annwn, a realm perceived as
either a blessed paradise or a hellish landscape, with
the experience dictated by individual fate. Alongside
the chthonic goddess Cerridwn, they serve as the
lord and mistress of the cycles of life and rebirth.

Though bound to Annwn, Arawn is known to
occasionally                           venture into the mortal realm,
particularly the Forest of Meath, where he hunts
monsters with his supernatural white-eared, red-
eyed dogs, earning him the title of Lord of the Hunt.
Cerridwn, however, remains ever vigilant as the
gatekeeper of Annwn, protecting her magical
cauldron, a vessel of immense power that, if
misused, could disrupt the delicate balance of life
and death by granting immunity even to the finality
of death itself.

Brigit: Goddess of Life

Brigit, the goddess of life, fertility, and spring, is the
revered daughter of the Dagda and the goddess
Morrigan, a beacon of wisdom and peace among the
Sisters Gan Creadigeath. Legend whispers that Brigit
was once the wife of Hlacheu ap Dagda, the first

other creatures of the Otherworld and the people of
Maedoen. Her presence is celebrated during the
joyous holiday of Imbolc, marking the hopeful
midpoint of winter and the promise of spring's
return.

Cernunnos: God of Nature

In the heart of ancient Maedoen, where the wild
thrived                              under the watchful gaze of Cernunnos, the
Horned God, a tale of love, betrayal, and the birth of
a new order unfolded. Cernunnos, protector of the
first Maedoen druidical order, ruled over unspoiled
nature, embodying the untamed essence of the land.
Yet, even the mighty Cernunnos was not immune to
the allure of love. He fell for the enchanting fay moon
goddess Arianrhod, daughter of Cerridwn.

Learning of Arianrhod's yearning to reunite with
her                              mother in the underworld of Annwn, Cernunnos,
moved by compassion, stabilized the Equinox gates
of Ainerêve. This allowed Arianrhod access to an
equinox gate at his fortress at Carrefol Cyfain, near
the borders of Meath forest, a gate that led directly to
Annwn.

Arianrhod rejoiced at their reunion, but her
mother,                      Cerridwn, rebuked her, fearing for her
daughter's fate. The Dagda and Arawn, powerful
deities of Maedoen, disapproved of Arianrhod's
connection to Oberon, the king of the fairies.

Cerridwn herself had once roamed the realms freely
and                             fallen in love with an elf named Beli Mawr, a
prince of Oberon’s realm. As punishment for her
tryst with a creature outside the Tuatha Dé Danann,
she was condemned to guard the gates of Annwn
forever, separated from her daughter. Now, allowing

368


no interlopers from the Seelie Court, the Dagda
issued                                a dire warning through Chydonax, the first
hierophant of his order. Cernunnos was commanded
to close access to Annwn.

Cernunnos prepared to obey his overlord's
demands,                               but Arianrhod, who also loved Oberon and
had borne him Mab, the demigoddess Queen of the
Fairies, sought to prevent the gate's closure. Mab,
learning of her mother’s plight, moved to seduce
Chydonax, distracting him from his duty to oversee
Cernunnos’s compliance. The distraction delayed
Cernunnos, and Mab begged her father, Oberon, to
intercede and prevent the Seelie Courts from being
shut out of realms to which she and her mother felt
entitled. But he refused to help, and Mab, enraged,
joined the Unseelie Court to aid her mother.

Together, they intended to seal the fate of Cernunnos
and                              his druidic order before the Dagda could again
limit the range of the shee domains.

In a heart-wrenching betrayal, Arianrhod used
sorcery                                to bind Cernunnos while Mab enacted her
deadly seduction, leading to the murder of the
archdruid Chydonax. Mother and daughter then used
the gates to banish Cernunnos. This act, taking place
at the first Nexus Portal at Carrefol Cyfain, marked
the beginning of the matriarchal order of the Gan
Creadigeath, which Arianrhod intended to lead with
her daughter.

But the Dagda, angered by Arianrhod’s actions and
arrogance, appointed the Goddess Brigit to oversee
the new order instead, ensuring its members would
not fall under the sway of the shee. In revenge, led by
Mab, the Unseelie Courts dismantled Cernunnos’s
druidic order, scattering them to their doom in the
distant reaches of chaos. The Dagda’s druids
threatened to destroy the Gan Creadigeath in
response, but Brigit interceded. She revealed that
Mab was bearing Chydonax’s son and declared that
this child would be taken from her and raised by
Oberon’s Court in tribute to Cernunnos’s lineage,
even after his defeat and exile. Mab, now aligned

with the Unseelie Courts, plotted revenge against her
father, Oberon, for his disregard.

Thus, the Gan Creadigeath was born from a
tapestry                               of love, betrayal, and power struggles,
forever entwined with the fate of Cernunnos, the
exiled Horned God. The matriarchal order, under
Brigit's guidance, would strive to maintain balance
in a world forever altered by the clash between
deities and the ambitions of the shee.

Math Mathonwy: God of
Wizardry

Math Mathonwy, a unique deity in the pantheon of
Maedoen, is revered not for divine might, but for his
embodiment of the boundless potential within
mortals. Legends suggest that Mathonwy, once a
mortal wizard, transcended his limitations through a
relentless pursuit of knowledge, achieving a form of
immortality rooted in his mastery of the arcane. His
teachings emphasize self-reliance, intellectual
curiosity, and the belief that true power is earned
through understanding and dedication rather than
divine favor. Central to his philosophy is the idea
that magic is a craft to be honed through discipline
and practice, a belief deeply ingrained in the
Octocirculi Academy, the most prestigious
institution for magical study in Maedoen.

The Academy, structured around the eight schools
of                              magic, challenges students to unlock their
potential through rigorous study, with no shortcuts
allowed. Mathonwy's influence extends beyond the
Academy, inspiring a culture that values education,
intellectual achievement, and the pursuit of
greatness through one’s own efforts. In this way,
Mathonwy serves as a beacon for those who seek to
understand the mysteries of the universe and master
the arcane through their own merit, embodying the
spirit of Maedoen’s magic—vast, mysterious, and
waiting to be uncovered.

Deities of Dalmavand

Odin, the Allfather, reigns supreme over the Norse

BESTIARY

However, this period marked the inception of a
complex power play, as a mighty demon named
Baphomet saw an opportunity to wield power by


gods of Dalmavand. He sacrificed his eye for wisdom,

and he commands war, poetry, and magic. His quest
for                         knowledge is relentless, and he rules Valhalla,
where the bravest warriors await Ragnarok.

Thor, the Thunderer, defends Dalmavand with his
mighty hammer Mjölnir. He embodies courage,
strength, and loyalty, and his voice thunders over the
land. He is the shield against the storm, the bulwark
against the night. He respects Odin, his father, and
shares his burden of protecting Dalmavand.

Loki, the Trickster, is a paradoxical god of mischief
and                            change. He shape-shifts and schemes, bringing
trouble and innovation. He helped create Mjölnir and
Asgard's walls, but he also fathered monsters and
threats to Dalmavand. He challenges the status quo
and tests the mettle of gods and mortals.

Freya, the Lady, is the goddess of love and magic in
Dalmavand. She is a master of divination and
enchantment, and she bestows her gifts on those
who seek her favor. She is also a goddess of fertility
and prosperity, and she blesses the land with
abundance. She is a lover of beauty and art, and she
inspires those who create them.

Sol Invictus (Baphomet)

In the middle ages, a large band of Templar Knights,
alongside                            thousands of pilgrims, were journeying
from France to Jerusalem. A reveorage storm, a
phenomenon known for its ability to transport
individuals across realms, swept them into the land
of Ainerêve. The knights, adapting to their new
environment, claimed the land for civilization,
establishing a provisional bishop and a Master
Templar, making the region livable. This land,
marked by a forgotten Latin name as a sign of piety,
was eventually shortened to Psarmorum.

For centuries, these Templar Knights defended
themselves against the nightmares of Ainerêve.

impersonating the God revered by the Templars.

Baphomet, distinguished from other demons by his
cunning, patience, and adherence to bargains,
conspired to transport the knights and pilgrims to
Ainerêve. This was achieved with the assistance of
two other entities, thus intertwining the dream
storm rift with demonic machinations. In exchange
for his intervention, Baphomet gained worship as
Sol, with Luna and Astra as aspects of his unholy
trinity. Notably, Luna is identified as his consort,
Lilith, while Astra's true identity remains a mystery.

To secure the allegiance of both good and evil,
Baphomet                           crafted an illusion of righteousness. He
elevated the Templar’s master to grandmaster
status, and under the guise of Sol Invictus, he
presented himself as a warlike and implacable deity,
with Luna and Astra symbolizing mercy and
salvation, respectively. His vassal demons, disguised
as angels, supported the pilgrims, ingratiating
themselves as celestial beings.

Over time, Baphomet subtly altered religious
scriptures                               to emphasize obedience, piety,
conformity, and intolerance towards mystical
beings, outsiders, or the spiritually lax. Yet, within
these teachings, he maintained redemptive elements
and left clues for the discerning.

Simultaneously, the original Templar leaders, who
secretly worshipped Baphomet, initiated worthy
knights into occult rites, promising them wealth and
power. Baphomet's long-term strategy involved a
gradual corruption, knowing that a rapid decline into
depravity would be unsustainable.

Psarmorum flourished as a nation under
Baphomet's                           influence, becoming a formidable force
of warriors and devout followers of the One God. The
blood of demons, periodically infused, runs through
the veins of Psarmorum's nobility, strengthening
their allegiance to Baphomet.

370


However, Baphomet's ascendancy enraged Satan
and                                his demons, who opposed him as vehemently as
they opposed the forces of good. To maintain
control, Baphomet ensured that Psarmorum’s rulers
actively hunted and destroyed any demons not under
his dominion, as well as individuals straying from
his prescribed path. This campaign of fear and
suspicion cemented his control over the populace.

In this intricate web of deception and power,
Baphomet                              has successfully established a temporal
and spiritual stronghold in Psarmorum. His ultimate
goals, whether world domination or ascension to
true godhood, remain known only to him and
perhaps the wisest of sages.

Vassal Demons and Peris: Baphomet’s celestial host
included not only disguised demons but also peris,
mythical beings from Persian lore. This assembly of
beings under his command further reinforced the
illusion of a celestial pantheon supporting the
Templars.

Manipulation of Scriptures and Ideology: The
gradual                          alteration of religious texts by Baphomet
was an effective strategy. By slowly distorting the
scriptures, he fostered a culture of unquestioning
obedience and intolerance, yet cleverly left hints of
the original teachings. This manipulation ensured
that his followers adhered strictly to his doctrines,
while still believing in their divine origin.

Demonic Bloodline in Nobility: The infusion of
demon                             blood in the nobility of Psarmorum is a
significant aspect. This practice not only solidified
their loyalty to Baphomet but also granted them
enhanced abilities, making them formidable
opponents in both political and military arenas.

Struggle Against Satan and External Demons:
Baphomet’s                            success attracted the ire of Satan and
other demons. This external threat played into
Baphomet's hands, as it allowed him to position
himself and Psarmorum as defenders of the faith
against other demonic entities. The continuous
struggle against these external threats served to

371

unify Psarmorum under Baphomet’s rule and justify
his                            harsh doctrines.

The Dilemma of Psarmorum’s Rulers: The rulers of
Psarmorum, while ostensibly fighting against
demonic forces, were unwittingly serving
Baphomet’s agenda. This irony underscores the
depth of Baphomet’s deception, as the rulers
believed they were upholding righteousness while
actually perpetuating the influence of a demon.

The Role of the Templars: The Templar Knights,
originally                        guardians of the pilgrims and the faith,
became key agents in Baphomet’s plan. Their
transformation from protectors to unwitting pawns
in a demonic scheme highlights the insidious nature
of Baphomet’s influence.

The Psychological Impact on the Populace: The
constant                             state of vigilance and fear instilled in the
people of Psarmorum served to maintain control and
discourage dissent. Baphomet’s regime, therefore,
was not just a physical dominion but also a
psychological one, where the fear of external and
internal threats kept the populace in check.

Baphomet’s Long-term Vision: While Baphomet’s
immediate                           goals are clear - control over Psarmorum
and its people - his long-term objectives remain
shrouded in mystery. Whether he seeks to challenge
the celestial hierarchy, attain true godhood, or
simply revel in the power he has accumulated is a
subject of much speculation among scholars and
sages.

Baphomet's rule in Psarmorum is characterized by
a                               web of deceit, manipulation, and strategic
alliances. His ability to maintain a facade of divine
righteousness while orchestrating a realm under
demonic influence showcases his cunning and
foresight. The implications of his reign extend
beyond mere political control, delving into the
realms of spiritual corruption, psychological
warfare, and the manipulation of faith.


Nigma

BESTIARY

transformations often erupt from the most
unexpected                       sources, forever altering the fabric of


Nigma's presence permeates the Eldritch Realms, an

elusive force as enigmatic as the shifting tides of
fate.                             Unlike deities bound to specific domains or
cultures, Nigma embodies the universal yearning to
control and shape destiny—a force intertwined with
their existence and the very creation of the Eldritch
Realms, born from the collective dreams of
humanity.

Often depicted by a complex variation of the
eternity                    symbol—interwoven lines converging at a
central point—Nigma symbolizes the cyclical nature
of choices and their reverberating consequences.

This emblem reinforces the belief that destiny is not
a                       predetermined path but a flowing river shaped by
countless decisions.

Nigma's doctrine, inherently adaptable, resonates
across                              the diverse cultures of the Eldritch Realms.
Scholars, innovators, and those who dwell in the
shadows all find something within Nigma's
teachings that speaks to their desire to bend fate to
their will. Yet, this adaptability breeds a spectrum of
interpretations, sometimes sparking conflict among
Nigma's followers. Some perceive Nigma as a subtle
guide, others as a force of unbridled chaos, each
striving to manifest their own unique vision of
destiny.

In the ever-evolving Eldritch Realms, Nigma's
presence                             stirs the currents of change, disrupting
established orders and challenging the rigid
hierarchies of other deities. Followers of Nigma,
whether organized into clandestine cults or walking
solitary paths, often grapple with internal strife due
to their divergent views on manifesting destiny. Yet,
they share an unyielding belief in the power of
individual agency, united by the conviction that they
can shape their own fates, however perilous the
journey.

Nigma's presence vibrates through the Eldritch
Realms,                               a persistent echo challenging the notion of a
fixed destiny. They whisper that the most profound

existence. Those who dare to embrace Nigma's
teachings                              may ascend to unimaginable power, but
they must also be prepared to face the consequences
of their choices, for in the Eldritch Realms, destiny is
a double-edged sword.

/c/ and /g/ are hard, and the /r/ is rolled. The /ch/ is
as                                in ‘loch’; /h/ softens consonants; /ae/ is
pronounced /ai/ and /oe/ is pronounced /oi/.

French (Psarmorum) is nasal. The /é/ and /ei/ rhyme
with                               ‘hey’; other e’s are as in ‘men’; a final ‘e’ is
silent unless accented. Final consonants are often
silent. The /i/ is a long /ee/ sound. The /eau/ rhymes
with ‘go’. We have written French /oi/, /gn/, /j/ as
they sound, /wa/, /ny/, /zh/ (e.g. Agnes, Joie, Guy =
Ahnyes, Zhwa, Ghee).

Note: The sages of Psarmorum, renowned for their
study                              of ancient texts, maintain that the true
pronunciation of "Ainerêve" is "Eh-nuh-rave," as
revealed in a fragment of an ancient tome predating
the earliest records of the French Templars. This
pronunciation, holding a deeper significance to the
world's essence, is favored by those seeking to

unravel Ainerêve's secrets and honor the wisdom of
the Psarmorum sages.

Names

This section provides lists of typical names for the
inhabitants populating the towns, villages, and
groves of Ainerêve. Choose, or roll dice to allocate
randomly.

Dalmavand. Dalmavand names are mostly Norse;
some                            are Anglo-saxon. Bynames (e.g. Fairhair,
Bluetooth, the Red, the Wise, Bloodaxe) are used
rather than fixed surnames. In Norse, ‘son’ meant
‘son’ and ‘dóttir’ meant ‘daughter’, so Grímr’s
children might be called Thorkell Grímsson and
Guthrun Grímsdóttir.

Maedoen. Maedoen names are mostly Welsh; some
are                           Gaelic because of interaction with Meath.

Bynames (e.g. Huw of Seatown, Huw Math’s son,
Huw                                the Fisher, Huw the Tall) are used rather than
fixed surnames. In Old Welsh, ‘ap’ meant ‘son of’
and ‘merch’ meant ‘daughter of’, so Huw’s children
might be called Owen ap Huw and Olwen merch Huw.

Psarmorum. Names in Psarmorum are almost all
French, but a few are from elsewhere in Europe.
Surnames are used. Ecclesiastics sometimes adopt
Latinate names when they take holy orders. Noble
family surnames often start with ‘de’ (meaning ‘of’
or ‘from’) before a place name, as in de Nimes or
d’Or.

Meath. Names of Forest of Meath natives are mostly
Gaelic;                            some are Welsh because of interaction with
Maedoen. Bynames are used (e.g. Mór of Redgrove,
Mór Sahrich’s daughter, Mór the Tree-speaker, Mór
the Nimble) rather than fixed surnames. In Gaelic,
‘mac’ meant ‘son of’ and ‘ingean’ meant ‘daughter
of’, so Fergus’s children might be called Cormac mac
Fergus and Maeve ingean Fergus.

Towns and villages

Ainerêve is a ‘sandbox’ setting, with some important
things                         specified, such as cities and adventure
locations, and the rest left for you to arrange to suit
your campaign. For instance, lesser and less
adventurous settlements can be added to the map as
required. Guidelines are given below.

Settlement sizes for Psarmorum (halve for
Dalmavand, Maedoen, or Meath):

Hamlet 50–300(d6 x 50)
Village400–900(d6 x 100 + 300)

Town1000–6000(d6 x 1000)

Dalmavand and Maedoen are moderately populated,
and                              their settlements are small. Roll d6 for size: 1–3
hamlet, 4–5 village, 6 town. Psarmorum is well
populated. Roll d6 for size: 1 hamlet, 2–4 village, 5–
6 town. For Meath, roll d8 for size: 1–4 hamlet, 5–7
village, 8 town. Human settlements are few, near the
edge of the forest, and all hamlets. If the settlement
is elsewhere or larger, it is a Fay community or
encampment, and probably hidden by illusion at
least.

General notes. Assume an average of five persons per
dwelling place; one tradesman (blacksmith, brewer,
carpenter, hedge wizard, etc.) per 150 population;
and one inn or tavern, plus one shrine or temple, per
200 population. Hamlets tend to centre on one
activity (farming, fishing, forestry, hunting and
trapping, mining); villages will deal with several;
and towns are centers for more extensive trade and
will be on main roads and beside rivers. Villages are
with 10 miles of a castle or keep in Dalmavand and
Maedoen, 5 miles in Psarmorum. Each town in either
country is walled and has an associated castle. Each
castle has a lord and fighting men, a thaumaturge or
two, and various officials, but draws on the local
populace for its servants.

Attitudes. Although this book focuses on the many
monsters and problems that adventuring heroes will
fight and face, most people in the realm live fairly
ordinary lives concerned with everyday matters.

They provide a base of normality, and are not usually
hostile.                          Their general dispositions, by settlement,
are as follows:

Dalmavand d6: 1–3 friendly, 4–5, neutral, 6
unfriendly.

Maedoen d6: 1–2 friendly, 3–5, neutral, 6
unfriendly.

375


BESTIARY


Psarmorum d6: 1–2 friendly, 3–4, neutral, 5–6
unfriendly.

Meath d6: 1 friendly, 2–3, neutral, 4–6 unfriendly.
Obviously,                           you can choose what you like, individuals
will vary, and adventurer actions can modify the base

reaction. Friendly can mean smiles, greetings, and

visitors made welcome, or simple politeness in
towns.                            Neutral means wariness (perhaps the party
are thought to be tax collectors?), indifference, or a
business-as-usual approach. Unfriendly can mean
surliness or fear of strangers (maybe the village has
something to hide, or there are guards because of
recent raids), or (as is usual with Fay) a wish to be
left undisturbed.
