# book-md-tools

Helps convert and prepare books for layout. Deterministic tools and pipeline for converting OCRâ€™d PDFs and legacy source into clean Markdown suitable for Word/InDesign workflows.

## Features

- Header depth correction with hierarchy validation
- Paragraph and table fixers
- OCR error correction (base + targeted + config-driven overrides)
- Spell check, long-line, and paragraph-break QC
- VS Code tasks for one-click runs

## Install (editable)
```sh
pip install -e .
```

## CLI
- `book-pipeline <input.md> [--out-suffix _pipeline_v1]`
- `fix-headers <file.md> --max-depth 4`
- `fix-ocr <file.md>`
- `fix-ocr-extra <file.md>`

## Repo hygiene
- Keep large PDFs and full books out of public repos; include samples/snippets only.
- Use `reports/` for generated QC artifacts (gitignored if public).
