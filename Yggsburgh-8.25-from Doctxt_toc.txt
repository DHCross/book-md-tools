Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

## Foreword

†

ONCE UPON A TIME there was a Mad Archmage whose castle and dungeons became synonymous with adventuring. That place remains today. Only the names have changed to protect the concerned parties for this publication. You are holding this product now, as it is a part of the changes necessary. In order to present the “abandoned” castle and its many dungeon levels, an area surrounding the place needs to be detailed. You have it! Note though that this base area is completely new, in order to facilitate the later addition of the old castle and dungeon material in revised form. Do not wonder why you never read or heard about Yggsburgh, and the other persons, places, and things in and around it. They are recent creations of mine and done with all of the spirit of the original work.

As you peruse the contents of this work, you will find all manner of adventure areas, even the location of Castle Zagyg. Unlike other places, though, that one locale, the castle and its dungeon levels, has no special encounters or details. Why? Because that part is massive. There are many floors of the fortification and even more underground maze levels yet to be done. What? Aren’t those places already completed?! After all, scores, hundreds in fact, of players had their characters adventure in them in the past. Well, that assumption is correct, but as any Castle Keeper knows, material created that is ample for his own purposes is not at all suitable for commercial presentation in a module. A careful revision of the existing level maps and their brief notes is necessary. That is, of course, a monumental undertaking considering the projected size of the whole work. There are details of all encounters, cross- connections between many dungeon levels, and overall text descriptions to explain everything presented. So that’s for later. A series of modules are also planned for the expansion of this base.

Right now what you have in hand is the environs of the Castle Zagyg complex. It is a complete playing module, a campaign setting unto itself. The area is large, so that characters can adventure in it sans the castle proper. To ensure this, the descriptions of many places are loaded with adventure hooks. The walled town for which the module is named, Yggsburgh, provides not only current playing opportunities, but it and its suburban area too, are meant to later serve as the base from which characters can operate in their dungeon delving. You will note that the greater community has all that is needed to supply and assist the adventuring team. It is developed with a history, economy, political structure, socio- economic information, and a detailed monetary system. There are also, as previously stated, many other areas on the map likewise ripe for derring-do, many detailed, some others purposefully left mainly for the able hands of the Castle Keeper to develop. A module wouldn’t be complete, though, without a few dungeon- like areas, and this is a complete work. So you will find several herein. Check out the subterranean area maps!

Enough preliminary exposition. Let us move on to that which is here and now, Yggsburgh and environs. Enjoy the story and the action that follows and be sure to pick up the next installment of Castle Zagyg, The Dark Chateau, by Rob Kuntz. Gary Gygax


## Notes for the Castle Keeper

†

This setting is recommended for two sets of characters per person. The ones initially adventuring in this module should begin at low mid-level, 4th to 6th. These characters can be created on the spot or else drawn from the players’ existing ones of that level spread. The adventures in and around the town call for such advanced ability…and more! Several levels should be gained in the action presented herein. When play moves to the actual castle and its many dungeon levels, each player should then generate a new character of 1st level. These characters can be relatives, friends, or henchmen of the higher-level ones used initially. With new characters of beginning level, the proper spirit of the original dungeons will be captured and enjoyed. When they delve to the depths of the Castle Zagyg dungeons, they will be adventurers of considerable power.

When dealing with encounters (whether random or those set forth herein), feel free to adjust the difficulty level for the party. If the characters are relatively low-level, reduce the number and strength of their opposition to make the match more even. Where the adventurers are of high level, add more power to their opponents and increase their number without hesitation. For example, if the foes are 1 hit dice humanoids, add a stronger “associate” monster, make some of the humanoids tougher, perhaps 2 or more hit dice. Do just the same with humans and demi-humans by adding levels. Put as many additional opponents, hit dice or levels to create as much force as is needed to give the party a severe test. Make it a real challenge to them.

Be sure to familiarize yourself with the layout and contents of this book, though not necessairly the details. The Castle Keeper should know where to go to get the information they are after. Part I of Yggsburgh is a historical and cultural overview of the setting. Part II details many of the places within the free town of Yggsburgh while Part III details the environs about Yggsburgh. The appendices are a wealth of information for the Castle Keeper so be sure to examine them as they contain the Orders of Battle, encounter charts and new monsters, to mention a few things.

Within, some encounter areas have non-player character stat blocks that are missing. These are located in Appendix I, Orders of Battle, as these non-player characters have a tendancy to crop up in many places and in order to offer easy accesss to the stats they were placed together in one appendix. Further, within the stat blocks, HD is hit dice, AC is armor class, PA is prime attribute, SK is secondary skill and EQ is equipment. The remainder should be self-explanatory.

There is also a “Zagyg Adventure Reference” entry located with many area descriptions. This simply kists associated adventures, peoples and places and supplies a ready reference for Castle Keepers to allow them to make associations between places, peoples, and even events. There are varying levels of detail here reflecting the importance or significance of the encounter.

Finally, there are no rogues in Yggsburgh. There are just thieves. For all intents and purposes, the thief in this volume is like the rogue for Castles & Crusades, only more nefarious and not a tad bit evil.

Setting, History and Culture

# Part I : Yggsburgh Setting, History and Culture

## Introduction

†

This section contains much information, that may or may not be common knowledge, about Yggsburgh. It is up to the Castle Keeper to decide what the characters know and how they came to know it. Should they be from a place far away from Yggsburgh, they may know little of its history and culture. Should the characters actually be from Yggsburgh, it is likely they will know a lot.

For those undertaking the task of running adventures in Yggsburgh, do not attempt to memorize all the remainder of the work. It is recommended, though, that you become familiar with the material in this section. Details of the town are needed when describing things to the players. Have the main map of the city handy as you scan the encounter information, and make a point of learning the general details of the city and its major features. There is also much room left for developing Yggsburgh to fit your needs as a Castle Keeper. Please examine Appendix A, Developing Yggsburgh for more details.

## Background and Overview

†

The Free Town of Yggsburgh is a heavily fortified community of some 22,000 residents, with another 10,000 or so persons dwelling on the lands it claims as its own. The town is constructed on the rock bluff where the River Nemo is joined by the Urt River. The area encompassed by the community’s walls is about one square mile. Because of the bluff Yggsburgh is built upon, its buildings climb from a street level of about 10 feet above the surrounding plain on the east edge to fully 40 feet above that plain at the western end of the town where its great citadel stands. Thus, one approaching from the east can see the place well, the incline of the bluff seeming to tilt the western end of Yggsburgh upwards for the viewer’s inspection. The walls are built atop the solid rock of the bluff, the sides of the natural formation shelved at the waters’ edges, then splayed to an upwards distance of about 10 feet, thereafter rising precipitously in near perpendicular face to the top. The town walls are set back an average of 20 feet from the edge of the bluff, but the many towers and bastions between them along its length are very near the rim, and have only a narrow path of some three to four feet around their verge.

As one comes nearer to the fortifications, it can be seen that there are war engines, scorpions and catapults on the gatehouse and tower roofs. A careful survey reveals a massive citadel at the west end of the town, it having two regular towers and a great one looming above the confluence of the Nemo and Urt Rivers. The thick town walls sprout 36 defensive towers by your count,


not including the pair that flanks each of the three gatehouses by which the place might be entered. The wall towers are set with about 500 feet distance between each. At the intervals between them are semi-circular wall bastions that thrust outwards from the walls, as do the towers. On each of these 36 bastions you can see a pair of scorpions and a catapult. One thing is certain: if Yggsburgh has a strong military garrison, this town can be defended against a massive attacking force.

Townbridge, the main approach to the walled community, is at its southeastern side. The bridge is something of a remarkable architectural achievement, as is the canal that serves as a moat on its eastern side. The town is well-known as an active trading center. In addition to the salt, gold, gems and jewelry, Yggsburgh’s industries export quantities of flour, dried and salt fish, fine wood, furs, cloth, metal ware such as tools and cooking ware, and much good pottery. Its most famous buildings are the Grand Temple, its Citadel, the college complex, and the Mayor’s Palace.

The town is particularly proud of its water and sewer systems, and its relatively straight, wide, and very clean streets. In the better districts, buildings have indoor plumbing and central heat, the streets lighted after dark. Yggsburgh also boasts two modest little parks, as well as two large and three small plazas, the latter just inside the three town gates. Most visitors remark on the fact that all of the buildings in the town are constructed of stone block, bricks, or a combination of the two. The newer structures in the eastern half of the town are mostly of brick and not particularly lovely, but not prone to fire even in crowded lower-class sections.

The town is ruled by a Lord Mayor and a council of eight important men. The Lord Mayor appoints officials to see to the administration of the community. A fair number of knights are vassal to the Lord Mayor, and with the regular military force employed by Yggsburgh, it is considered a strong and safe haven for honest folks. Thus the territory immediately around the town is prosperous, relatively quiet and free of raiders and bandits, so river and road commerce is active. That said, not a lot of questions are asked of strangers, and as long as local law is obeyed, “foreigners” are welcome in Yggsburgh. It has a large suburban area to the east, across the Yggsburgh Canal, this being called “The Outs.” The population is modest, 4,000 or so, but all there are quite without the strictures of the town. The place isn’t lawless, for the town law applies, but most of the time there is no town authority there to see to it that the law is obeyed.

The region is by no means idyllic, as there are three palatine nobles within three or four day’s march of Yggsburgh, each of whom covets the town and its rich lands and would like to add them to his own demesne. Spies and agents provocateur are not uncommon in Yggsburgh, and thick in The Outs. The outlying areas are generally wild frontier, with bandits and humanoid raiders a menace, and dangerous creatures prowling.

Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

## History

†

The walled town of Yggsburgh is about 300 years old, but up until around 100 years ago it was no more than a large trading village with low walls and a lot of river traffic stopping at it to gain its salt and agricultural produce. When gold and valuable garnet and quartz gems were discovered in what is now known as the Glittering Knobs a century ago, there was an immediate dispute amongst three nobles whose lands were adjacent to the area— Huon (Baron Redfort), Delkart (Count Easmoor), and Edmund (Marquis Talworth). As there was no strong monarch ruling them, the dispute between the nobles soon broke into open warfare.

When Marquis Talworth managed to capture the area, he set his architect and engineers to work immediately. Soon Yggsburgh was aswarm with masons, other craftsmen, and laborers intent on building walls and towers around the burgeoning village. With the aid of various mages, the whole construction (including a considerable canal between the Urt and Nemo Rivers, serving as both a transport artery and vast moat for the new town) was accomplished in a mere five years. Costs were financed by the salt mine in the Serpent Ridge, and with ore and gems being mined from the Glittering Knobs.

Neither of Talworth’s rivals was satisfied with the outcome, so Baron Redfort and Count Easmoor made common cause. Thus allied, their forces met and defeated those of the Marquis in what is known locally as the Battle of the Westfields. However, their victory did not bring the desired result. A local petty noble, Edward, Lord Yggs (to whom the village and salt mine had belonged), with a handful of knights, cut down the foreign garrison, closed the gates and defied the would-be conquerors. Because the local populace were heartily fed up with heavy-


handed rule and ruinous taxes, those in the community as well as those from the lands around flocked to the town in arms and swore vassalage to Lord Yggs, promising to defend it, him and his lands. Even so, there were scarcely enough warriors to man all the walls and towers properly. The massed forces of Baron Redfort and Count Easmoor laid siege to Yggsburgh.

Things looked grim for Lord Yggs, as the investing army managed to get across the canal and the Urt River, establish bridgeheads near the town walls, and attack both the Moatgate and the Rivergate by siege engine and magical spell. Although no spell- casters of note were within the walls, the attackers were driven back by great dweomers. Some unknown wizard had come to Yggsburgh, used his power to counter the assailants’ magic, and used his own spells to rain destruction on the enemy. Having suffered great losses thus, the two nobles abandoned the field.

So it came to pass that the town was ruled by Lord Yggs for some 20 years, and under his guiding hand it grew and became wealthy from trade and manufacture, as well as exploitation of nearby mineral resources. As it prospered, he caused a great temple to be built in thanks for the deliverance, and the flourishing condition of town and lands around. When Lord Yggs died childless, his officers and knights were astonished at the contents of his will. Lewis Garmonde (Lord Yggs) commanded that his estates be kept as their own by those holding the lands, and that the town become a free one, the nobles owing vassalage to the community at large and its Lord Mayor. His will decreed that a council of eight great men of the community serve to make laws, and elect for a period of 10 years one other like man (who was not a council member) to serve as Lord Mayor and administer the town. At least six council members had to agree to the one to be chosen as Lord Mayor. The Lord Mayor was to see to the maintenance, policing and security of Yggsburgh, enforce the council’s laws, and levy taxes approved by the council.

The eight members of the council had been named by the dying lord as: the chief priest of the grand temple to serve as president, the masters of the two largest town guilds, its wealthiest banker as its treasurer, the most able mage in the town, the president of Yggsburgh College as its secretary, and two knights who dwelled in the town and held the largest estates adjacent to town- held land.

Of course the citizens of the town and its surrounding lands were overjoyed at this bequest. Not all of the officers and knights of the deceased lord were so pleased, though. There was much muttering and clandestine meetings amongst the two dozen or so highly influential persons in Yggsburgh, but all came to naught in regards to declaration of Lord Lewis Garmonde’s Last Will & Testament as invalid. The most powerful figures decided that being a permanent council member

was better than risking a many-sided fight for rulership of the town, for surely those who elected its Lord Mayor held the real reins of power. So the will of the last Lord Yggs was carried out, and Yggsburgh and its adjacent lands are free, ruled by an elected Lord Mayor, this condition existing for over 90 years.

It need not be stressed that the council is so divided amongst power and interest groups that it rarely acts in unity, so the Lord Mayor is quite secure in his 10-year office tenure as long as he performs reasonably well and avoids open graft and corruption.

It is disturbing to the ruling elite of the town that the property owning burghers have recently proposed an elected Assembly to assist the Lord Mayor and Council through advice and consent, for matters pertaining to the common folk. All property owners would vote, and the 25 candidates for the Assembly receiving the most votes would be seated therein. Neither the Lord Mayor nor any Councilor has espoused the suggestion, and the property owners are becoming insistent. There is talk of withholding taxes and forming a Citizen’s League with serjeants at arms to keep order.

## Yggsburgh and the World at Large

†

Yggsburgh and its environs are large in content, but the area of land it covers is relatively small, a bit less than 1,700 square miles (or an area of some 50 miles east-to-west, 34 north-to-south). With some inclusion of areas “off the map,” that size is sufficient for much adventuring but should be small enough, at most perhaps 3,000 or so square miles, if all the border areas described in the adventure text are included, to fit into any campaign world, whatever one is used by the Castle Keeper. The area is likewise suitable to serve as the core for building a complete campaign world around it should that be desired, a major undertaking to be sure and not a subject for further discussion here.

The society of Yggsburgh is assumed to be basically Western European, rather English in culture, and generally feudal in political structure. Feudalism is defined as lordship and vassalage, the vassal owing the lord fealty, service, and taxes from the fief granted. As in later medieval times, a fief of land is hereditary, as is the title that goes with it. Only treason or a like crime empowers the lord to reclaim the fief and title. Knighthood is non-hereditary,

**Lords **Mayor **of **Yggsburgh**

###### Setting, History and Culture

but lands granted to a knight pass on entire to his eldest male heir (primogeniture and entail). Feudalism is decentralized government, with vassals governing their fiefs, not the lord, and meting out even high justice (capital punishment included) in regards to villeins. Here the feudalism is a mix of the agrarian manorial fiefs and a kind of pension fief. That is, some of the vassals receive business enterprises in return for their vassalage instead of land. Such enterprise yields them an income for which they owe fealty, service, and taxes. In any case, both sorts of fiefs must be managed properly to support the vassals and generate a tax return.

The manorial fief includes villeins bound to the land and dwelling in villages, receiving all law and justice from their lord. The manorial fief also encompasses yeomen, freemen who own their land by having paid over money to the vassal for it, socmen, freemen who pay rent to the vassal for their land, and communities of such free folk. Freemen are entitled to high justice, that dispensed by the overlord, for major crimes, but they are subject to local (low) justice for ordinary misdemeanors.

Note that many places in this setting are independent of the Town of Yggsburgh, have an independent lord, or are free of any vassalage. Garham, for example, is just such a place. For purposes of this setting, the communities of free folk are classed as “thorps,” settlements of some 100 persons, and “hamlets,” communities of 200 or more persons, but under 1,000 (where “town” becomes proper name). The Castle Keeper can assume one craft or trade business for every 50 inhabitants over 100 persons in a community. So, a thorp of 150 persons might well have a blacksmith or an ale house, while a hamlet of 250 population would have both and perhaps a general store as well. The business fief does not include all of that, but the workers are employed at the whim of the vassal and he dispenses low justice to them, including life and death, and might have the power of taxation.

The cultural level is that of the High Middle Ages, and early Renaissance in developed states. Technology is at least on a par with that general period, more advanced in areas of agriculture, transportation and engineering, but lacking chemical explosives as is usual in a fantasy world setting. As the Romans of our real world built fine roads, bridges, and aqueducts, used concrete and had central heating, indoor plumbing, and underground sewers, including such amenities in the larger communities of civilized states is not a stretch, especially in a fantasy milieu that does not assume a total collapse of a former advanced civilization, the loss of virtually all of its important books and records, and a vast decline in knowledge that only time and great effort can regain. This was, of course, what happened to Europe when the Roman

Empire fell to the invading Teutonic peoples.

Keep that in mind as you place this module in your campaign world, and there should be no problems. Further guidance as to the best locale for Yggsburgh and environs can be gained from the history section below. Of course the Castle Keeper is free to alter such information so as to suit his campaign.

## Local Palatine Nobles

†

The lands near Yggsburgh are controlled by local Palantine Nobles. They are: to the West, Lyle Baron of Redfort, to the Northeast Bertram Count of Easmoor, to the East Edgar Marquis of Talworth, and Talworth’s vassal, the Wizard Lord Uvoll Darktarn.

The Castle Keeper is left to develop the majority of chief henchmen of these competing nobles if they are to play a significant role in the campaign. The Wizard Uvoll Darktarn, the main agent of Marquis Talworth, is described further on in the text and repeated in the Orders of Battle appendix. Each of the noblemen will have a wizard, cleric, and several lesser lords and/or knights as liegemen. They might well have a thief spymaster and an assassin serving them as well.

Using the information supplied in the Appendix I, Ordrers of Battle, the troops available to Yggsburgh and to Lord Uvoll, one can develop extensive orders of battle for the three rival nobles, or simply have such details as amorphous and inconsequential to play because no large-scale invasion will be dealt with in the campaign. If military details are undertaken, make sure that the forces fielded by the three are considerably larger that those available to Yggsburgh, as an attacker confronting a foe in a fortified city needs to have a superior force to have a chance of prevailing. Of course, the basic forces of the three might be only slightly superior to those the Lord Mayor can muster, with the attacking noble or nobles using mercenaries and humanoid troop additions as the means for one or the other to attempt conquest.

## The Culture of Yggsburgh

†

The Castle Keeper should not consider this frivolous information. Where more than hack & slash play is involved, social custom and dress are important for setting the stage for role-play activity. One’s character is judged initially by apparel and manners. Of course, informing players of fashion and customs means they should have their characters be concerned about such things as hygiene and grooming, proper costume and accessories, and the right sort of weapon to have when appearing in the town’s better areas. Even if they do not become involved in “bettering” their social standing, the players will be likely to want their characters accepted by those in power so as to at least not be hunted as criminals. Having connections in high places pays off.

On the plus side from the Castle Keeper’s standpoint, this not only encourages a lot of interaction with the business establishments of the town (costing the characters considerable sums of money), but in the process makes them a target for cutpurses, pickpockets, and all manner of other thieves and swindlers.

The exception to the following is the military man who wears


his uniform sans heavy armor and weapons when socializing. See Appendix I, Orders of Battle, The Citadel, and Yggsburgh Encounter, 7. The Citadel hereafter for uniform descriptions.

###### Population

The following lists the approximate population of Yggsburgh and the racial identity of its inhabitants.

Humans: 22,000 (plus underclass of 2,000)

Demi-humans: 1,100 (about 5% of total population) Dwarves: 260

Elves: 90

Gnomes: 350

Half-Elves: 120

Halflings: 200

Half-Orcs: 30

###### Social Classes

There are four socioeconomic classes or standings described herein, each class having tiers within it: underclass, lower class, middle class, upper class. The incomes are high, the society is well- to-do, and that makes plenty of opportunity for underclass theft, as well as for covetousness in neighboring nobles.(For a thorough exposition of this subject the reader is referred to the book _lieiug Pautasy_, also published by Troll Lord Games.)

**Underclass** This includes non-free persons such as slaves, villeins, free persons without property and unemployed (beggars, masterless men and vagabonds), and all known criminals, even those who practice an approved or licensed wrongful activity such as theft, prostitution, or begging. There are three standard tiers—lower, middle, and upper. The upper class is comprised of the most successful criminal element. Most in this class are not numerate or literate. Average annual income is indeterminate, but the members of the uppermost tier of the criminal underclass are wealthy.

**Lower Class** Free folk of little economic means who range from common laborers in the lower tier, through peddlers in the middle, to servants of the upper class at the top tier. The least clerics, friars, monks, and nuns are in this class, but in the upper tier of it. Because of ecclesiastic educators, assume some of the persons here are numerate, barely so in the lowest tier, in the middle barely literate, and in the upper tier most persons numerate and literate as would be provided by a fourth grade education. Average annual income for this strata, from lowest tier to highest, excluding the clergy, is: 500-800gp, 1,000-1,700gp, 2,000-3,000gp.

**Middle Class** Free folk of moderate economic means who range from small tradesmen in the lower tier, through craftsmen in the middle, to wealthy merchants at the top tier. The average local cleric is in this class. The middle and upper tiers of this class are fully numerate and generally literate, as would be provided by an eighth grade or higher education. Average annual income for this area, from lowest tier to highest, is: 1,500-3,000gp, 3,700-6,200gp, 700-25,000gp.

**Upper Class** The very wealthy freemen and aristocrats who range from great landowners and bankers and gentle folk in the lower tier, knights and petty nobles in the middle, to the great nobility of the town and its Lord Mayor in the top tier. The high clerics are in this class. The average education of this class is greater in the lower tier than in much of those above, with an average educational level equal to completion of high school. Average annual income for this area, from lowest tier to highest: 23,000-45,000gp, 37,000-100,000gp, 63,000-140,000gp.

###### Dress, Style, Appearance and Manners

Both males and females in Yggsburgh wear particular styles of clothing and have precise manners of dressing their hair. These are discussed below. It is suggested the Castle Keeper be at least nominally aware of this and describe those encounters in some detail to impart this upon those playing in the game. This heightens the detail and adds depth to any game. Most players appreciate this, and it would be a shame not to capitalize on the information provided to create a better game.

###### Males

**Hair Wigs of blonde and red-blonde color at shoulder length, with curls before the ears, are the fashion for all aristocrats and well-to-do citizens of the town, so men’s hair beneath them is close-cropped. This includes demi-humans, as well as humans. The less-affluent of the lower middle and upper lower class, that are unable to afford a proper wig, wear their natural hair in like style. The commoners of the middle lower and lower lower class, and the underclass, of course, wear their hair in bowl-like cuts that have been the style for a decade or more now.

**Beard No proper gentleman has more facial hair than perhaps a small moustache and short beard on chin. The majority of the aristocrats and well-to-do citizens are clean-shaven. Only dwarf citizens now wear beards, and those dwarves wishing to retain social status trim their moustache and beard to but a few inches length.

**Hat** The latest mode is a square-crowned hat, one corner forward, with a moderately broad up-curled brim all round save for the forepart where a long, pointed visor protrudes. The color of the hat must either match or contrast in complimentary manner with the cloak, or in warmer weather the coat, of the wearer. The usual hat colors are brown red, dark orange red, dark amber, sage green, brown ranging from the darkest to a very light hue, sand yellow, and dove gray.

A band at the base of the crown holds feathers or plumes. Sedate nobles and gentlemen wear tall upstanding feathers of a suitable color at the back of the hat, the more thus sported the higher the station proclaimed. The Lord Mayor has five in a fan, but even the wealthiest commoner would not dare to wear more than one.

Knights, esquires, and bravos wear plumes, usually one or two on the right side of the hat if titled, on the left otherwise (by

###### Setting, History and Culture

gentlemen and rich young gallants, or one to the forepart of the band if a bravo spoiling for a duel or other sort of armed combat).

**Outer Garment** Now in vogue for when the weather is cooler is a three-quarter length velvet cloak worn in toga-like manner, with the left side of the body covered and the right open. This cloak is fastened at the right shoulder by a large, broach-like pin.

Gold is the sign of wealth, and the nobles and very wealthy have precious stones set into the gold. The less affluent have silver set with ornamental stones such as agate. Only the least affluent have plain silver or brass cloak pins with glass “stones.” To be proper the color of the cloak must be an earth tone regardless of the hue of other garments beneath it, so terra cotta, red and yellow ochre, gray green, various browns from very dark to near tan, sand color, and medium gray are typical.

**Other Clothing** The man of means wears a fine satin or silk frock coat under his cloak. This garment has a buttock-length skirt, and is cut away in front. The most fashionable models have lace at the collar and cuff, the sleeves being rather large so as to accommodate a lace-frilled handkerchief in one, a nosegay in the other. Most models have both outside and inside pockets, but inner bulges are a sign of baseness, as if the wearer has his coat’s pockets filled with papers and the like that imply common work.

A tight, long sleeved cuirass-like doublet covering the body from neck to waist is worn under the frock coat. Note that while appearing to be expensive clothing, this garment might well be actual body armor of padded cloth or cloth-covered oil-boiled and hardened leather. A baldric for a sword is usually worn over the shoulder of the doublet, although the most recent fad amongst young bravos is to omit this sword hanger and sword in favor of a walking staff, as explained hereafter under Weapons.

Around the waist is wrapped a sash held in place by a leather belt that is narrower than the sash, and from which the wearer depends such things as purse and dagger.

Knee-length britches, tied tightly at the knee and matching the color of the doublet, are worn with hose and low, slipper- like shoes by some, but the more dashing have boots that reach the top of the britches.

Completing the outfit are a pair of tight-fitting fine gloves of the thinnest sort of leather—kidskin or the like. These must be of light color such as cream or buff and unsoiled, of course.

A fashionable young gentleman might be arrayed in matching cloak and hat of dark orange red, the hat with a black plume in front. His frock coat beneath the cloak might also be of black with a pattern of embroidered lions in a dark orange red, with black leather belt and knee-length boots. With doublet and britches of golden yellow, a scarlet sash separating the

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

two matching garments, this fellow presents a dashing image that all will recognize as someone of high station and some considerable means.

**Jewelry** In addition to a cloak pin as already detailed, the most important piece of men’s jewelry is a neck chain that should be worn atop the doublet. This chain should be of gold (both red and white gold are acceptable) and set with gemstones. To indicate highest status, the center medallion is one’s badge of knighthood or symbol of town, college, or guild office. Otherwise, a larger stone will do. The less affluent have fewer gems, or none at all, but only the least of the middle class would dream of wearing a silver neck chain. Next comes a jewel-studded watch kept in the pocket, with a gold chain pinned to the frock coat’s front, depending from this chain a bejeweled fob of gold and gems to show that the unseen timepiece is also of the most expensive sort. As with the neck chain, the metal and jewels of watch, chain, and fob indicate class and social status. Lastly, the proper aristocrat should wear a ring with a large precious stone on the forefinger of the left hand, this fitting over the glove.

**Weapons** A dagger depending from the belt is de rigueur. No heavy sword is proper. The only fashionably acceptable weapon of this sort is a small sword with an overall length of no more that two and a half feet. The scabbard for it must be fancy, and the weapon’s quillions and pommel must display inset stones of at least semi-precious sort if status is to be maintained.

Many young bravos have abandoned the baldric and small sword in favor of a walking stick called a feather staff. It is of about four feet length with a metal head portion, thus suitable for use in offense and defense. The wielder can at will depress a catch near the end knob, and with a firm rap of the butt of the feather staff release three blades that fan out from the upper portion. These blades are slender, sharp- edged, and thinly pointed; the central one is of 18 or more inches in length, the two angling side blades of five or six inches in length meant to catch an opponent’s weapon, or deliver slashing damage if a thrust with the main blade misses its mark.

###### Females

**Hair** Following masculine fashion, women of quality in Yggsburgh have also adopted the wig. These wigs are curled, long and attractive, generally of either palest platinum blonde or blue-black in color. Natural hair is worn relatively long and pinned up under the wig. Those women that are socially conscious but unable to afford an expensive wig wear their tresses in a manner meant to come as close to looking like a wig as possible. Those commoners not concerned with fashion continue to braid their hair, either in a long queue of broad plaits worn down the back or as two tightly braided strands worn in front.

**Cosmetics** A lady’s complexion is meant to show her status, and as it is now fashionable for women of quality to engage in the chase, and play at outdoor games such as croquet and badminton, a light tan is the correct thing. Those socially


conscious females who do not have one use powder to convey this effect. The usual range of other beauty enhancing cosmetics are also employed—eyeliner and eyelid pigments (blue if a white wig is worn, green or rose if the wig is black), mascara, and rouge for lips and to add color to the cheek. However, as red is considered passé, the colors in vogue are scarlet orange and mauve for the lips.

**Hat** When engaging in outdoor activities such as sports, no wig is worn, and the head is covered by a cap with a low, pointed crown and a short, likewise pointed visor. When at home or out and in town the lady of fashion wears a velvet or silk cap sewn with metallic threads of gold and or silver, set with seed pearls of small figures such as butterflies or flowers of bright, tiny beadwork. This is fastened with long, bejeweled pins atop her wig. When at a more formal activity or occasion, she wears a silk or satin hat of the same color as her dress or gown. Such hats are broad-brimmed with a large, puffy crown to accommodate the wig beneath it. These are removed when indoors at a banquet or other sort of party, so that the wig and its adornment can be properly displayed. Common females wear linen caps that are flounced and unfastened, or plain and tie beneath the chin.

**Outer Garment** Velvet cloaks of near floor-length and generally of a pastel color are worn when the weather is inclement or colder. The cloak is held closed below the throat by a gold chain that clasps to either side of the material, all three of the fastening parts set with gems and pearls, of course. As with men’s cloak pins, only the lower income folks don’t have gold and gems, the less affluent having plain gold or silver set with ornamental stones such as turquoise, and the least moneyed having only ordinary wrought silver. The inside of such cloaks is lined with a bright silk cloth of the same color as the outer velvet, but of strong hue; thus, for example, a pale yellow one will be lined with saffron-colored silk. The ordinary women make due with ordinary cloaks that tie shut, these garments usually worn with a cowl in cooler weather.

**Other Garments** Dress fashion dictates that a daytime garment cover the throat and the arms to the elbows or the wrist, the top rather like a doublet, while evening ones have a low, square bodice, a back that leaves the lower neck exposed, and nearly no sleeves. All such dresses worn by ladies of quality have a considerable indrawn waist to accommodate a broad belt in daytime, and gowns with no waistline in the evening. Dresses have skirts that fall well below the knee, the leg being covered by hose and calf-high boots; gowns fall to the top of the slippers worn for evening. In the daytime a mantle or shawl is generally worn over the shoulders. The lady’s hands are free to clasp a goblet, small bouquet, fan, or the like, as her broad leather belt holds purse and chatelaine by day, while at night a small bag for lace handkerchief, cosmetics, and perfume vial is attached to left writs by a slender strap. Fabric materials for daytime wear are of more ordinary sort cotton or linen, finest wool in winter. Daytime wear is usually patterned or embroidered, while evening wear of silk, satin, or finest velvet is plain or brocaded. In warm

seasons colors are pale and cool, blues, greens, and lavenders.

###### Setting, History and Culture

###### Human Male Names

In cooler seasons colors are bright and warm, the yellows, oranges, reds to deep red-purples.

When sporting, ladies don light leather gloves, typically of suede, otherwise when outside short white ones cover their hands in the daytime. In the evenings high fashion demands elbow-length gloves that match the color of the gown be worn at grand soirées, otherwise hands are leather gloved outside, bare indoors.

All that said, the female common folk usually wear blouses and belted skirts, an apron or smock over them if working. These are of linen or wool, the colors plain—unbleached, white, or pale blue blouse, skirts of dark blue or black. When needed, they might have a plain cloak to don, otherwise make

Their feet are bare and sandal-clad in warm weather, or covered by stockings over which ankle-high shoes are worn in winter. If working on a boat or other place where a skirt would be a hindrance to them, it is replaced by wide-legged knee britches known as locally as “skirt-breeks.” This sort of garment is frequently seen in the countryside where women are working outdoors.

**Jewelry** In addition to the cloak clasp and hat pins already mentioned, women of fashion wear small earrings and some

Women of ordinary sort wear ivory or silver necklaces, rings, and bangles when showing off their jewelry. Those of more means might have such items set with ornamental stones such as amethysts and red garnets. Commoners of little means have glass beads, copper bangles, jewelry of shells and the like.

**Weapons** Only when at the chase or traveling does a lady of quality don a sheath and poniard on her belt. Some few might also include a small sword at that time. Women of less social status generally have on their person a dagger or knife.

As should be obvious from the above, it is unusual for a female to be engaged in warrior-like activities in this region. If one is actually an able fighter or the like, this fact is generally concealed except when actually practicing such occupation.

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

Coin of the Realm

In Yggsburgh no foreign coins can be legally accepted, as the town mints its own coins of all metals and denominations, and the possessor of such money will be directed to a bank or money changer. The rate of exchange is 90% of actual metal value. Foreign coins are melted down at the Mint and recast as Yggsburgh models. Yggsburgh posseses distinctive coins, meaning that foreign coin is easily recognized. The coins come in various denominations, weights and values.

1gp = 1 ounce gold 1sp = 1 ounce silver 1cp = 1 ounce copper

**Gold Coins** The “heads” portion of the gold coin is a portrait of Lewis Garmonde, last Lord Yggs. The “tails” has the armorial bearings of the town. Gold coins come in the following denominations.

1gp coin, .5gp coin, .2gp coin and .1gp coin

**Silver Coins The “heads” portion of the silver coin is a frontal erection picture of the town’s Grand Temple, and the “tails” has the armorial bearings of the town. Silver coins come in the following denominations.

1sp coin, .5sp coin, .2sp coin and .1sp coin

**Copper Coins** The “heads” portion of the copper coin is a yeoman standing with an axe held slanting across his body, while the “tails” has the armorial bearings of the town. Copper coins come in the following denominations.

1cp coin, .5cp coin, .2cp coin and .1cp coin

This system converts readily to any coin name, with 1gp being whatever coin name the Castle Keeper wishes—bezant, crown, ducat, florin, etc. If you like a more complex system, call gold pieces “crowns” and “half-crowns,” etc. Silver might be called “florins,” and copper coins “thalers,” for example. If gold is not as valuable in your game system, simply reduce the amount of it found in that system, substitute silver in place of some of gold to fit the more realistic value used (gold being assumed as 50 times more valuable than silver, and silver with an exchange basis equal to 10 times its weight in pure copper), and the generally accurate relationship of metal values.

###### Town Revenues

The following sources bring in, average net after salaries and wages, monthly revenues of 25,000gp to the Yggsburgh town treasury. Note that these revenues do not include a special levy on citizens for military protection and upkeep of fortifications. This amounts to an average tax addition of 0.5% of property value and 5gp per person.

The net of regular revenues is sufficient to accumulate about 15,000gp a month in excess of all expenditures, and this excess is currently being divided equally into banking loans and investments, as the treasury has a reserve of 3,500,000gp in cash, precious metals, and gems. The accumulation of liquid capital, and its being put back into circulation through loans and


investments, is aimed at building a war chest for use in expanding the land controlled by the town, so that the reserve funds will not be heavily drawn upon. When added to income from loans and investments, the total annual profit for the town is in the area of 450,000gp. Subtracting 45,000gp for the Lord Mayor’s bonus, and 22,500gp for each Councilor (a total of 225,000gp), this leaves an average annual net gain to the treasury reserve of 225,000gp.

**Agriculture Livestock and farm produce (butter, cheese, fruit, whole grain, nuts, seeds and vegetables) generate about 5% of the total revenue of Yggsburgh. This agricultural produce is from payments due for land tenure and rents and some export downriver.

**Banking The town’s treasury is ample, so as much as half of its value is loaned out at interest, this enterprise yielding a return equal to 15% of total revenue.

**Fishing** The town owns and operates a pickled and dried, salted, preserved fish operation that exports some reasonable amount of product downriver to Dunfalcon. Returns from this enterprise equal 1% of revenue.

**Investments Other than it’s directly owned preserved fish and flour milling businesses, the town has invested in various enterprises, such as shipping, locally and in Dunfalcon. The yield from this is a return equal to 18% of gross revenues.

**Milling The milling of grain into flour, most of which is shipped downriver to Dunfalcon, yields 1% of town revenue.

**Mining** Barges coming from the area of the Glittering Knobs carry minerals to Yggsburgh for refining, casting into ingots, coins, and other working, such as cutting and setting for gem minerals. The direct revenue this brings town’s coffers averages 5,000gp at 5% of value. This equals 5% of total revenue. The revenue this brings to the refiners and gemners and jewelers is in the neighborhood of 50,000gp monthly, a tithe of which enters the town’s coffers. Of course the trade supplying the mines, the refineries, and other operations centered on this mining produce, sale of precious metal ingots, and the use of the metals and gems in finished exports, go far towards toward making the townsfolk wealthy.

**Licenses, Permits & Fines Payments for the issuance of licenses and permits, and fines levied for breaking laws, bring in 1% of the town’s total revenue.

**Salt** The salt mines in the Serpent Ridge generate no less than 8% of the town revenue.

**Tariffs Levying of tariffs on various goods brings in an average of 1% of town revenue.

**Taxes & Tolls** Land, property, and sales taxes and tolls for bridge use, gate entry by non-citizens, generate 44% of the gross revenue of Yggsburgh.

**Wood** Select harvesting of large hardwood trees from the Deerwood brings in 1% of Yggsburgh’s revenue.

###### The Suburbs of Yggsburgh

###### The Brick Works

The Brick Works are located on Mills Road between the Marvel Playhouse to the South and The Mills to the north. This brick works and the cottages are owned in fief by Sir Morgan Nalbord.

The Brick Works has nearby dwellings housing some 200 persons, again about 50 of them being employed making bricks and transporting them. Surrounding the buildings—works proper, kilns, and storage sheds—to the south are vast mounds of clay. These are from the digging of the canal. As that waterway was constructed, it was discovered that the clay being removed for the channel was perfect for making firebricks.

###### The Insiders

This area is located to the east of Inside Street and north of Bankside Lane, but excluding the buildings along the west side of Nemo Street and the south side of East Road, all of which are businesses. This central section of about four square blocks extent is filled with tenements and penny-rent buildings, in which the many lower class laborers dwell.

The inhabitants are mostly casual laborers working the canal or seeking employment in town. They number around 2,500, and of that number some 500 are members of the underclass, unable to enter Yggsburgh, about half of them criminals. The homeless beggars here are not included in any population figures. Their likely number is 100 or more.

###### The Mills

This area is located at the north end of Mills Road after it turns northeast and becomes Shanty Track. This is the location of a large Grist Mill (Yggsburgh Encounter, 87. The Grist Mill). This is a large mill house with a water wheel being driven by a flume diverting water from the Urt River to fall and power the great device. That in turn drives the gears that turn the millstone to powder grain—wheat, oats, or barley. There are some 50 persons working in the town-owned mill, loading whole grain from the four adjacent granaries, bagging flour, carrying it to the storehouse, or loading it into vehicles for transport. Across from the Grist Mill along Mills road are cottages in which dwell some 200 persons, the workers and their families.

###### Nemo River Fishers’ Thorp

This area is located at the east end of Shanty Track. It is a collection of 20 or so small cottages and shanties occupied by fisherfolk and their ilk. They have an unimpressive alehouse. The ale brewed on site is passable and inexpensive at 7cp per pint. The only food available in the alehouse is dried sausage at 5cp per small stick, or smoked river perch at 5cp per small whole fish.

###### The Outs

The suburban area called The Outs is large, extending from the Yggsburgh Canal westwards over a mile, with a north-south distance of nearly two miles. Assuming an area of two square miles is not incorrect.

###### Setting, History and Culture

The population is roughly 4,000 total. The eastern population of this area consists of five farm families, totaling 60 persons when hired hands are included. Two of the farms are diary operations with orchards and apiaries, the other three being mainly truck farms that also raise hogs and small livestock. All their produce, and a lot more, is consumed by the town, of course, but the truck farms supply a large percentage of the vegetables eaten in Yggsburgh, and a fair amount of the eggs, poultry, and pork.

The northern and southern river-fishers’ thorps each have about 120 inhabitants in a score or so small buildings. Their catches likewise help to feed the townsfolk.

The Mills have associated laborers’ cottages that house some 400 persons, 100 of them being mill workers, the remainder family members.

The Brick Works also has nearby dwellings owned by the factory and housing some 200 persons, again about 50 of them being employed making bricks and transporting them.

From the playhouse south along Mills Street to the boat works there are no houses, and any population found here is homeless and transient.

South of East Road and west of Nemo Street is the community called The Outs, so it is Outs proper. This place was settled by those who didn’t want town restrictions and taxation, or couldn’t afford to live in Yggsburgh. The Outs proper covers some 10 square blocks and has a population of around 3,000 persons, as many of the buildings in the area are storage and warehouse facilities, or else low-class entertainment places such as rat-baiting and cock-fighting pits, ale and bawdy houses, or cheap cooking and eating establishments. Note that the underclass, including criminal underclass, comprises abut 20% (600) of the population here. Its size is nearly that of a town, but it has no such formal organization for its government.

###### Rivermen’s Town

This area is located between the Yggsburgh Canal from Nearmoat Lane to Inside Street (west side only) and along the south side of Bankside Lane to Nemo Street. This oddly-shaped area, equaling about three square blocks in extent, contains many low dives and seamy entertainment establishments, storage buildings and warehouses, in addition to some number of normal trade stores and craft shops, and a few private residents along Bankside Lane. The population numbers about 500 individuals, most of whom are lower class or underclass persons.

###### The Sawmill

This is the second large mill house on the Urt River. It also has a very large water wheel driven by a flume that diverts river water to fall and turn the great device. The wheel’s shaft and gears operate saws that cut logs into timbers and planks, the lumber used in building structures, boats, ships, and land vehicles as well as all manner of furniture.

There are some 50 persons working in the sawmill, bringing in logs to be squared, seeing to the cutting of logs into posts or boards, carrying that lumber to the adjacent drying sheds, or loading ready

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh



lumber into vehicles for transport. Across from the Sawmill along Mills Road are cottages in which dwell some 200 persons, the workers and families. This sawmill and the cottages are owned in fief by Sir Eberhardt Beemish.

###### Urt River Fishers’ Thorp

This thorp is located along Bankside Lane east of Nemo Street. It is a collection of 20 or so small cottages and shanties occupied by fisherfolk and their ilk.

###### General Architectural Style

First and foremost, all major construction in the walled community is of stone, brick, or a combination of the two. Only on back alleys, and in a slum-like areas, will there be found any buildings of timber and plaster, or frame ones of planks. The building codes of the town are strict so as to minimize the threat of fire.

Further and importantly, the armorial bearings of the free town are found on many public buildings above their entries. This is an escutcheon of gold with a blue chevron separating two blue pikes (or luce, fish) above and a blue mailed fist at the base. Above the escutcheon is a crest of a city gate in gray stone crowned by a coronet of gold with five acorn-topped points. To either side of the escutcheon, supporting it, are giant lynxes standing on their hind legs with paws touching the shield. The motto below the escutcheon reads: None can deny us independence.

The town’s grand temple stands out because of its size and unique architecture. The exact architectural style of the structure is left to the Castle Keeper, for it is a function of the pantheon of deities established by him as that honored by the majority of the community. The less-imposing temples and other religious buildings must likewise be determined by the Castle Keeper. It is suggested that such places of worship for the population be very ornate or exotic so as to clearly indicate they are special. For example, if a Greco-Roman type of pantheon is assumed, the grand temple would be a vast rectangular stricture with tall columns set around it, behind them a walkway, and then the actual walls of the building. To differentiate it from this world’s historical models, it might have tall square towers at the mid-part of each side wall. These towers would be considerably higher than the grand temple’s roof, and have protecting from their own roof peaks spires topped by the main symbol of their pantheon. A pylon-shaped structure, domes, or stepped upper stories are also viable. Use your imagination, but don’t stray too far from a basically European model so as to retain continuity.

Other large and formal buildings, such as town government, college, and major commercial ones are constructed in something like the Gothic style, but Roman arches are as commonly seen as the pointed ones of that architectural style. The same is true of the pillars and pediments of such buildings.

The majority of the structures in the community are not so grand and impressive, of course. These buildings are typical of European medieval and Renaissance construction, built with walls abutting each other and often with narrow street frontage, of several stories height, with the upper floors projecting over the

###### Setting, History and Culture

sidewalk to add space. To allow natural light into the mid-portions of crowded buildings, most common ones have light wells, and mansions are built around a central atrium. A few blocks of the town have buildings constructed in square around a central close. Otherwise, the usual form is a walled yard stretching from the rear of the main structure to the alley behind it, occasionally with some outbuildings standing at the edge of the alley rather than a rear wall.

Only the mansions and other buildings of the aristocrats do not stand abutting their fellows, even though land inside the walls is limited, and all space valuable. The houses of the wealthy also have rear lawn and garden areas. In style such places look rather like Roman villas, or Georgian if made of firebrick.

As this area has a warm temperate climate, the roofs of buildings do not have a steep pitch, for no great accumulation of snow ever piles onto them. They look more like those seen in Italian and French Renaissance architecture than those of the same period in England or Germany, for example, and many are flat and used in warm weather as a part of the dwelling.

###### Buildings

You will note that while there is extensive information pertaining to the Free Town of Yggsburgh, here and in the Appendix, most of the buildings in a community of this size are not detailed. The main reason for this is lack of space. It would take a work three or more times this size to provide the Castle Keeper with such comprehensive treatment. Secondly, and actually of equal import, the exhaustive detailing would be of little use, as the players are quite unlikely to be interested in investigating every business and residence in a town of over 20,000 population. What is given herein will allow the ambitious Castle Keeper to actually create complete blocks of the town, fill each with buildings, note the sort of commercial activity that takes place in business structures, and decide who lives in residential buildings. A perusal of the Appendix will suffice to supply the Castle Keeper with the number of buildings on a given block, and there is a list of nearly 200 different commercial undertakings for use in having various businesses in appropriate blocks.

The sheer size of the town prevents a large-scale map that details the many buildings and all the traffic arteries that exist in the place. There are effectively 92 square-block areas in the town, this area housing all the citizens and so forth. The Castle Keeper will be called upon to supply fine details, so the following information is important.

**Square **Blocks **and **Plazas Regardless of what sorts of arteries surround them, each regular square block is 460 feet per side, that measurement excluding sidewalks.

**Depth **of **Lots A main-side lot not on a corner extends 225 feet from the sidewalk to the alley. A corner lot might extend that far, but if there are alley-side buildings on the block the corner lot will extend only 10 feet beyond the structure proper.

**Number **of **Buildings **on **the **Sides **of **a **Block The main sides of a block are the two without an alleyway piercing their length.

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

The alley sides are self-explanatory, and these buildings do not usually have any extensive rear yard area, so their back portions are accessed by the alley or gangways only. Note that such paths might be dead ends. The distance from corner to corner of a building’s fronting is 460 feet. The average number of separate structures depends on the neighborhood, and alley-side building count does not include the corner structures.

###### Lower Lower Class

**Proximity **of **Buildings In some parts of the town, buildings will be constructed to that their side walls are in contact with those of the adjoining structures. Most will have gangways, and most industrial and warehouse structures will have gated driveways at the side or through the middle of the building to an inner courtyard.

**Gated **Driveways These are usually central openings to an inner courtyard surrounded by the building, although a few might be at one side of the building with the driveway leading past and behind the structure to a rear courtyard and alley access. Note that there might be an alley access from an inner courtyard.

**Gangways** These are typically openings between buildings that are narrow paths for foot traffic only, being on average no more than five feet in width. They often pass under extended first and other upper floors, possibly having steps going down to basement level to allow traffic to get past the main floor of structures with a ground floor raised above street level. Such gangways serve both to allow foot traffic to pass to the rear of the building and to enable building sides to have window openings for light and air.

###### Town Arteries

The Castle Keeper can assume the following facts regarding to the town of Yggsburgh.

**Arteries All the ways in the town are paved with cobblestones or firebrick, the latter being used for smaller paths such as lanes.

**Sidewalks** Sidewalks are of limestone or slate slabs, or else firebricks. They are raised above the artery they parallel by at least six inches. Immediately beside the walkway is a gutter depression leading to periodically-spaced sewer drains.

**Wall Paralleling Ways** All the arteries paralleling the wall are 40 feet across, with an inner walk of 10 feet in width and an outer margin of 50-foot width, a parkway (in grass) between their pavement and the wall proper, save where the wall towers project inwards and at town gates. The parkway around town gates is paved over to form small, plaza-like areas.

**Avenues and Thoroughfares These arteries are 40 feet in width and have sidewalks of 10 feet in width.

**Streets** These are ways that are 30 feet in width and have sidewalks of 10 feet in width.

**Parkway** Two 12-foot width lanes with a six-foot wide strip of lawn/small trees between them.

**Lanes **and **Other **Ways Lanes and most Ways are 20 feet in width and have sidewalks of five feet in width.

**Alleys Although not shown on the map, any block of normal size or larger has an alleyway running through its center, this way being 10 feet in width and hedged by building walls or fences in most places.

**Street Lighting** The town has no system of street lights. All alleyways will be generally very dark.

Parks are not illuminated. City gates are fairly well-illuminated on their interior side by large lanterns that hang from the walls on either side of the inner gates. Warehouses and factories are generally lit only with small lanterns beside or above entry doors. Lower and lower middle class streets will be generally dark, save for ambient illumination from doors and windows that are open or glassed and the interiors behind them lighted. Shuttered windows are typical at night where no business is being solicited. Scholastic area streets will have building-front lights for school buildings and commercial establishments.

Upper middle and upper class streets will have some fair amount of illumination from building-front lights. Many of such lights will be of magical sort. When an aristocrat is hosting a party the residence will usually be illuminated with fanciful colored lights that move and/or are in exotic shapes, these being created by means of dweomer.

Commercial buildings that are open for business after dark will have illumination such as lanterns or magical lights near their sign and entry. Affluent commercial buildings will likewise have lights near their entry to discourage criminals from breaking in.

**Street Cleaning** As a part of its services the town has a force of 30 street sanitation personnel, 24 of which are street sweepers who make their rounds daily. They have a wheeled cart, large broom and shovel, and either collect the refuse they sweep up or else push it into a gutter drain to be carried off into the sewers. Accumulated waste is taken back to their main building, loaded into horse-drawn wagons, and dumped off the Townbridge at first light before anyone is allowed into the community. The swift- flowing River Nemo moves this waste downstream in short order.

###### Setting, History and Culture

**Water & Sewer** As with street cleaning, Yggsburgh has a water and a sewer department. Each has some 20 employees, including plumbers and laborers who mantain these services.

The town has an artesian well springing from its western end. This water is piped into an underground reservoir there, the latter supplying water mains laid under the streets. All the buildings owned by those well-off are connected to a water main, so there is running water in most buildings. Those buildings not supplied with plumbing for indoor water and sewer must to rely on rooftop or basement cisterns and city fountains in the two plazas (Market Plaza and Citadel Square) and gates (Bridgegate, Moatgate, Rivergate), or park-sited wells.

There are hydrants connected to the water mains on the corners of about every-other of the town’s blocks. Once a week these are opened for a short period of time to flush the gutters clean.

There is an extensive underground sewer system running from west to east and emptying into the River Nemo at the southeast corner near the tower there. Most of the buildings in the town are connected to the sewer lines, and only some few of the “East End” blocks where the lowest tier of the lower class dwell rely on outhouses and cesspools for waste storage. Very little human waste is dumped into the gutter to be flushed down into the sewers by released water or rain. Waste from outhouses is collected from them by hired waste removal contractors called Honey Dippers or Tom Turd Men.

## The Elites and Administration

†

###### Ranks

The rankings below are setting-specific but based on the principles of actual medieval feudal society.

**Lord Mayor** In this case the Lord Mayor of Yggsburgh is a sovereign prince and in his city and on its lands, he is equal to any other sovereign, a king included. This is because he has not sworn vassalage to any greater noble. Even if he had so pledged to one, in his city and on his lands, he would be the peer of that monarch, coming second after him. In overall terms his precedence generally is akin to that of a sovereign prince of a small state (below a duke but above a marquis).

**Councilor** A Councilor of Yggsburgh is as a nobleman when in the city and on its lands. Elsewhere, such status would place one in the lower tier of the upper class. In this area, each Councilor is equal to the following in order of precedence in town functions:

The Lord Mayor, the Sovereign Prince

The Steward of Yggsburgh, if one is appointed, a Duke President of the Council (also a grand priest): Marquis Secretary: Prince

Treasurer: Prince

Counselor and Knight: Count (2) Counselor: Viscount (3)

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

**Royal titles** Emperor, king, sovereign prince (including archduke, grand duke, prince, etc. on down the noble titles’ ranks), crown prince, prince royal.

Baronet/Baronetess	Honorable Sir/Mdm

Knight (male/female)	Sir/Dame (wife Madam)

Gentleman/Gentlewoman	Master/Mistress

A gentleman (or gentlewoman, not styled “lady,” that being reserved for the wife of a lord) is a noble without title. As a nobleman born, or elevated, a gentleman is entitled to have armorial bearings. For this work gentle-born persons are styled “master” and “mistress,” while commoners of substance are “goodman” or “goodwoman.”

**Clerics** A grand priest ranks just below a duke, a high priest ranks just below a count (earl), a chief priest or abbot ranks just below a baron, a prior just below a lord, an officiant priest in charge of a fane, chantry, chapel, or grand shrine ranks just below a knight, an ordinary priest just below a gentleman (in the middle class).

###### Notes on Heraldry

It is expected that the Castle Keeper will have at least a rudimentary knowledge of heraldry. As the armorial bearings of places, organizations, and people are signatures, they are important in a fantasy campaign. Only one aspect of heraldry will be addressed here, that is the tinctures used in blazon.


**The **standard **colors **used blue (azure, light blue), green (vert), red (gules), and purple (purpure). To this list we add for this fantasy milieu: maroon, navy (dark blue, not indigo) and pink.

**The **standard **metals **used yellow (or gold) and white (argent, or silver). To this list we add for the fantasy milieu: gray (steel) and orange (copper).

**The **standard **furs **used ermine (white with black tail marks), ermines (black with white tail marks), sable (black), and vair (alternating rows of pale blue and white bell-shapes resembling squirrel skins). To this list we add for the fantasy milieu: seal (brown).

Most of the escutcheons described do not include the noted additions, but the Castle Keeper is free to use them to create a greater variety in armorial bearings. Remember colors go on metals, metals on colors. Generally speaking, furs also serve as the fields for colors. However, with the addition of gray and orange to the metals, one can be more free in creating escutcheon of metal on metal, copper on silver (orange on white), steel on gold (gray on yellow).

###### The Lord mayor of Yggsburgh

The current Lord Mayor of Yggsburgh, in his fifth year in office, is His Lordship Lochinvar Beechwood. His escutcheon is a border of green with gold mistletoe leaves on it, surrounding a gold field with a beech tree. He is originally from the Ashwood.

He is accompanied at all times by eight City Guards, and his palace is guarded by eight City Guards when he is away, 16 when in residence (see Appendix I, Orders of Battle, Council of Eight).

During his tenure in office, the Lord Mayor is provided with his palatial residence and paid an annual salary of 15,000gp. Additionally, if the town’s revenues show a profit for the year, the Lord Mayor receives a bonus of 10% of that profit in cash.

The Lord Mayor has the power to make any knight or noble a member of the Knights of the Order of the Citadel, and to grant ordinary knighthood to any gentleman. He is also able to elevate a commoner to the rank of gentleman, but this act must be approved by a majority of the Council.

Beside his normal duties, the Lord Mayor appoints and/or oversees the activities of the following town officers, listed in order of their precedence after the Lord Mayor, the eight Councilors, and any visiting nobles or, as indicated below, other knights of Yggsburgh:

Sir Alec of Gaxhill. Gaxhill might be convinced by the characters to swear vassalage to the Lord Mayor of Yggsburgh. If that occurs, he will be made a Grand Master of the Order of the Knights of the Citadel. His escutcheon is a field quartered green and gold, a white goose passant on the green quarters, and a green tower on the gold ones.

###### Levy of Yggsburgh

The town authorities make a point of calling out the able- bodied citizens and training them one day a month with soldiers overseeing the drilling and practice. The militia levy is called forth weekly in groups of approximately 225 individuals. Town fighting population in time of war is 1,400 troops.

The Knights of the Order of the Citadel that are not members of the town’s regular military will be placed in command of troops as captains responsible for the defense of a wall section. Also, in a time of crisis, the four town knights and their henchmen will each be given military command of a wall section. The various clerics willing to engage in warfare, as well as the guards and staff from the Gaol and Workhouse (about 60 fighters) will be mustered to aid in defense, and there will be another 1,000 or more unarmed citizens assisting the armed troops in defending the wall. These people will serve to bring up various things to their fellows— rocks, pots of liquid, missiles, food and water—carry off dead and wounded men, and in desperation hurl down missiles, or even pick up a dropped weapon or grab a tool to use in keeping invaders from the walls and towers. See Appendix I, Levy of Yggsburgh for more information.

###### Levy of Outlying Areas

The Lord Mayor calls all knights with their forces, plus the free population from the Westfields (c.350), Broadview Valley’s western end (30 men), and the South Pastures (c.150) (qq.v.) when an attack is known to be coming or the town put under siege. If the adventurers have managed to convince Sir Alec of Gaxhill, his considerable force (c.245) will be on hand also. See Appendix I, Levy of Westfields, Levy of Broadview Valley, Levy of Gaxhill and Levy of the South Pastures.

from the Thieves’ Guild there. Jewelry and like items brought in from elsewhere are sold to local gemners and jewelers at 50% of retail value. The same is true for most other new goods received thus, they being “wholesaled” to various town merchants and shops. The thievery thus returns some fair proportion of what it takes to the local economy. The Thieves’ Guild also assists in smuggling slaves from town to other destinations where slavery is not illegal.

The Thieves’ Guild is described in Yggsburgh Encounter 52, value Second Hand Market or The Thieves Guild. Crimes and their punishments are described in Appendix B, Crime and Punishment.

## Geographical Features

†

This section contains a description of those geographic features located around the town of Yggsburgh. All are also located on the map. Each geographic description has a list of associated encounter charts (see Appendix D, Environs Encounters) for use in that local, any persons of import associated with the region being described and any communities of note (see Part III, Communities of Yggsburgh). These references are not exhaustive but should serve to remind the Castle Keeper of that regions relation to the rest of the setting.

###### Ashwood

**Encounter **Table: Wooded Hills

**Adventures: 7. The Hunt

**Zagyg Adventure Reference:** Wynchwood Forest, Ashwood, Meadow Creek, Menhir Hills Road, Yggsburgh College, Lord Mayor of Yggsburgh

**Communities **of **Note: Villages of the Bald Hills

The Ashwood is about 36 square miles in area, nine miles long from northeast to southwest and some four miles wide northward. A great portion of it lies on the inaptly named Bald Hills. It consists of old growth hardwood trees in a great variety—ash, beech, chestnut, elm, hickory, maple, various oaks, and walnut predominating. Because of the nut trees, the forest is teeming with game, from large squirrels to deer and large wild swine. With plenty of food available, animals such as bears, big cats, and wolves hunt over the general region, hills and woods alike. Of note, the Ashwood is formerly the home of the current Lord Mayor of Yggsburgh, Druid Lochinvar.

###### Bald Hills

**Encounter **Table: Wooded Hills

**Adventures: 7. The Hunt

**Zagyg Adventure Reference:** Wynchwood Forest, Ashwood, Meadow Creek, Menhir Hills Road, Yggsburgh College, Lord Mayor of Yggsburgh

**Communities **of **Note: Villages of the Bald Hills


This is a hilly area of some nine miles in breadth in their southern part, while the northern end runs for four miles. This latter portion is a ridge-like spine ending only about a mile below the beginning of the Menhir Hills. The Bald Hills cover about 36 square miles of the territory and are under the rule of Yggsburgh. The southern portion of the hills are around 18 square miles in extent and are covered by the Ashwood. So the Bald Hills are really not aptly named, save for the northern portion. However, as a ridgeline of treeless hills do separate the Wychwood Forest northwards from the Ashwood, one can understand why they are distinguished in this way. The hills are generally wilderness, with grass and low brush covering them where trees do not. The hills are fairly steep, average elevation being from 100 to 150 feet, so there are many small dales, dingles, and glens amongst them. As they have no known mineral wealth, and being off the beaten path, the Bald Hills see few besides occasional hunting parties.

###### Big Fish Lake

###### Encounter Table: **Lake**

**Adventures:** 18. Giant Fish and Savage Reptiles, 4. Mound Island

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Bigfish Lake, Mound Island, North Eel River, South Eel River, Menhir Hills, Great Leech Marsh, Broadview Valley, Lakepens Hills, Lake Woods

**Communities **of **Note: Garham

This is a considerable body of water that is 16 miles long from the northeast to southwest. It is nine miles across at its greatest width, and narrows at its upper end to five miles across from shore to shore. It is some 110 square miles in surface area. Bigfish lake is quite deep. Its eastern end is shallower than the part southwest of its narrow portion. Above that narrowing the water is 40 feet depth on average and 150 feet at its deepest part. Below there, the average depth of the lake is 60 feet, and its bottom goes to 500 feet a mile southwest of the lower end of Mound Island.

The lake is cold and teems with all manner of eels and fish. Eels of incredible size, some over 12 feet long, are found herein and in both the river inlet and outlet of the lake, thus the name “Eel River.” The notable sorts of fish for which the lake is named include sturgeon and garfish of 20-foot and more length, catfish of near that size, monstrous pike of 10 or more feet length, huge bass and pickerel of five-foot and more length, and “panfish” such as the red sunfish, platter crappie, and golden perch of two-foot and more length that weigh six or more pounds. Lampreys as big as the eels in the lake are a menace, as are the huge leeches that inhabit its shallow portions where the bottom is of mud. Other lake inhabitants include snapping turtles of four-foot and more length, crawfish that are three-foot and more length, huge clams the size of wash tubs that produce fine freshwater pearls, and monstrous bullfrogs. The reedy margins of Bigfish Lake are home to many aquatic birds and very large muskrats. Its higher banks are the habitat of giant otters, creatures capable of taking all but the largest of the fish in the lake.

**Encounter **Table: Open Grasslands

**Adventures: 32. Gypsies and Enfeoffment

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: River Nemo, River High Road, Menhir Hills, Norvale, Buckswood Hills

**Communities **of **Note: Villages of the Broadview Valley, Garham

This valley begins about eight miles upstream where the Cold Springs Run joins the River Nemo. Broadview Valley varies from a bit under three to over six miles width, a part of which is bisected by the River Nemo. It is bordered by various woods and hills, and the River High Road runs its entire length. The total area of the vale is approximately 130 square miles.

On the western quarter there are two thorps. Further east there are a few isolated fields, some plowed, and cowherds and shepherds with herds and flocks along the north side of the River High Road where the valley’s western end is nearest to the town. The majority of it is wild, however, with game animals enjoying its pasturage, carnivores hunting them and benefitting from this natural plenty. That suits the local farmers well, as predation of their livestock is slight, and they hunt down and kill those animals that think domestic prey is easier to take than the wild sort.

###### Bowbridge

**Encounter **Table: Main Road

**Adventures: 44. Tolls and Trolls

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: River Nemo, Lakepens Hills, Richwood Forest

**Communities **of **Note: Bowbridge

The bowbridge is located on the River High Road. It is a single great arch, supported by three columns that allow passage of the River Nemo. It is a very old but solidly constructed bridge that has no toll, because it is on the frontier between the petty states of the region. There is an old tollkeeper’s cottage on the east side of the bridge.

###### Buckswood Hills

**Encounter **Table: Wooded Hills

**Adventures: 8. Ransoms and Bludgeonings

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Lakepens Hills, Deerwood, Lake Woods, Greypools Mire, Greenridge, Longwood Forest

###### Communities of Note: **None**

The Buckswood Hills lie east of the confluence of the Urt and Nemo rivers, about two miles east of Yggsburgh. Thence it runs northeast for 16 miles to where the hills become known as the Lakepens Hills and the Lake Woods cover them. From here, the Buckswood Hills extend nine miles north to the verge of the Greypools Mire. Further east, they merge into the Greenridge where it is covered with the trees of the Longwood Forest. In all, the Buckswood Hills proper cover an area of nearly 66 square miles, close to 60 of which are covered by the Deerwood. The


hills are not steep, and rise gently to tops ranging from 70 to 100 feet elevation above the lands about. These elevations are not particularly rocky, so flora grows verdantly upon all. The surrounding meadows make for excellent grazing, so the fauna of this area are plentiful and diverse.

###### Cold Springs Run

**Encounter **Table: Stream

**Adventures:** 22. The Nereid’s Warning

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: River Nemo, Serpent Ridge, Glittering Knobs, South Pastures

###### Communities of Note: **None**

This is a stream of 25 feet width where it joins the River Nemo. Cold Springs Run is navigable by small watercraft only about two miles eastward from that junction. Not shown on the map is the tributary of this stream, Salamander Creek. The latter waterway winds south-southwestward through the Glittering Knobs, and as it goes it is fed by many small brooks. The Salamander broadens to about 20-foot width a mile or so before it joins the Cold Springs Run. Nowhere is it of any depth, though, four feet being the average at its mouth. There is a fair amount of boat traffic on the short stretch of navigable water offered, however, these vessels bringing in supplies and carrying out gold, silver, copper, lead, and gem crystals from mining camps in the hills to the north.

Mining has eliminated most sorts of aquatic life in both of these waterways, but bullheads, carp, and dogfish remain, and all but the latter are caught and eaten by hungry miners. The banks of the Cold Springs Run and Salamander Creek are moderate (3-6 feet) near its mouth, becoming steeper as one goes upstream into the hills. There the sides are 5 to 10 feet above the water surface. Most areas of the banks not being worked by miners are a tangle of bushy plants and shrubs, and willows of various sorts. Many trees grow in copses and groves near the water.

###### Cress Brook

**Encounter **Table: Stream

**Adventures: 21. The Cursed Blessing

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: East Uplands, River Nemo

###### Communities of Note: **None**

This is a small and lovely little stream that flows down from the heart of the East Uplands to join the River Nemo about seven miles from the spring that is its headwater. The brook is renowned for its watercress and for the trout that are caught there. Wood elves are drawn to it, and there is said to be a small band of such folk dwelling in the surrounding hills.

The banks of this little streamlet are generally no more than a foot or two above the water’s surface. Because it flows through woodlands, plant growth is not heavy along the brook, with moss, low grasses, and trees being the most notable foliage, other than low-growing herbs such as mint and thyme, and flowering plants such as marsh marigold and shooting stars.

###### Deerwood

**Encounter **Table: Wooded Hills

**Adventures:** 8. Ransoms and Bludgeonings **Zagyg Adventure Reference: Buckswood Hills **Communities of Note:** None

The Deerwood is aptly named, as the small forest is the habitat for two species of deer, fallow and red. All of the usual small animals native to such woodland are found within it, as are large creatures, including wild swine, bears, large cats, and wolves. Its trees are mainly of the deciduous kind and include ash, beech, chestnut, elm, hickory, locust, maple, oak of various sorts, sycamore, and walnut. Hunting parties, aristocratic and common, come here from the Yggsburgh area to hunt game but, despite that, the animal population flourishes, for the hunters mainly winnow out the less fit specimens. There are very few woodsmen and wild elves that dwell within this place, though they can be found if one searches for them.

###### Dire Forest

**Encounter **Table: Dire Forest

**Adventures: 12. Shunned by Preference

**Zagyg Adventure Reference:** South East Uplands, Richwood Forest, North East Uplands, Marquis Talworth, Waldgraf Horst Reindmann

###### Communities of Note: **None**

The Dire Forest, often called the Direwood, covers a bit more than 80% of the northern East Uplands. The wood edge progressively retreats to the southeast as one goes east to the end of the hills. Thus the forest is of some 960 square miles in extent. The many great old hardwoods have made the interior of the woodland a dark place even in full daylight, for their interlaced canopy keeps sunlight from penetrating to the forest floor. Because of this, not many normal plants and animals are to be found in the place. The eastern half of the Dire Forest is within the fief of Waldgraf Horst Reindmann, a liegeman of the Marquis of Talworth.

###### Dunfalcon Pike

**Encounter **Table: Main Road

**Adventures: 36. Bandits, Thieves and Highwaymen

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: River Nemo

**Communities **of **Note: Yggsburgh, Villages of Dunfalcon Pike

The Dunfalcon Pike is a reasonably well-maintained and patrolled highway leading west some 300 miles to the city it is named for. It generally stays within sight of the River Nemo, save for a few places where terrain dictates the road’s course be more distant. Travelers, pilgrims, and all sorts of merchants use it as an artery. The pike passes through the lands of four independent nobles. From east to west they are the Barony of Redfort, County of Kallent, County of Herdley, and thence into the territory of the Free City of Dunfalcon. The aristocrats depend on it sufficiently so as to not merely refrain from molesting travelers using it, or charging them toll, but to actually maintain the roadway and to send out occasional patrols to see that robbers do not make it too hazardous for commercial traffic.

###### Setting, History and Culture

The countryside it passes through is rather wild, with a mixture of grasslands and forests crossing plains and hills. However, there are sufficient settlements along the road to make travel through its considerable length possible without great hardship. There are five hamlets with coaching inns between Yggsburgh and Dunfalcon. The journey from Yggsburgh to Dunfalcon takes six days by coach. These coaching inns are also used by water travelers coming upriver. On average, there are only four farm thorps in the 50-mile distance between the hamlets, and these are near the former because of the uninhabited and wild nature of the land between town and city.

###### East Hillway

**Encounter **Table: Track

**Adventures: 42. Hurling Boulders

**Zagyg Adventure Reference:** Menhir Hills, Bigfish Lake, Greenridge, Garham Scragwick, Falsford, North Eel River

**Communities **of **Note: Scragwick, Castle Gaxhill

The East Hillway runs from the fork with Quarry Track for about 12 miles before it crosses the North Eel River, about two miles above Bigfish Lake at a place called Falsford. Here the water passes over bedrock and is thus very broad, no less than 350 feet wide but only two feet deep. There is a hamlet named Scragwick here.

###### East Uplands, North

**Encounter **Table: Wooded Hills

**Adventures: 11. Invasion

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Richwood Forest, Dire Forest, Edgar the Marquis of Talworth

###### Communities of Note: **None**

The North East Uplands is a hilly area east of Yggsburgh. Only 16 miles of their western end are shown on the map, but they extend another 26 miles eastward and 12 miles south. The northern portion is that area generally covered by the Richwood Forest. The southern portion is covered by the Dire Wood. The area considered as the northern East Uplands is some 500 square miles in extent. The hills are rolling, some steep, others rising gradually to summits ranging from 100 to 250 feet, with an occasional great hill of three to four times the usual height—nearly a mountain. Numerous small hollows, dingles, dales, and glens lie within this area. Many of the steeper hills are rocky, and these often have caves in them. Other than onyx stone, no valuable mineral has been found in these hills.

The southern portion of the East Uplands extends some 26 miles eastwards; only 16 miles of its western end, projecting out to the

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

Serpent Ridge, are shown on the map. The southern portion is generally covered by the Dire Forest. The East uplands hills run from north to south on the map for some 10 miles and onwards to the south for another 13. The area considered the southern East Uplands is some 1,200 square miles in extent. As is the case with the northern portion, the southern hills are rolling, with a few having steep rises while others rise gradually to summits ranging from 100 to 250 feet. An occasional ‘near mountain’ of some three to four times that height can also be found. Numerous small hollows, dingles, dales, and glens lie within this area. Many of the steeper hills are rocky, and these often have caves in them. Other than marble, mica, and onyx, no valuable mineral has been found in these hills. The eastern half of the hills lies within the fief of Waldgraf Horst Reindmann, a liegeman of Marquis Talworth (see Orders of Battle Appendix and Environs Encounter 8).

**Adventures: 47. Slaves or Good Eating

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: East Hillway, North Eel River, Bigfish Lake

**Communities **of **Note: Hillmen Hamlet of Fallsford

Falls Ford is that place where the East Hillway crosses the North Eel River. It is about two miles north of Bigfish Lake at a place where the water passes over bedrock and is thus very broad, being no less than 350 feet wide but only two feet in depth. There is a hamlet of rather unfriendly hillmen a bit more than five miles east of the ford.

###### False Urt River

**Encounter **Table: River

**Adventures: 17. Witches and Waterways

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Greypools Mire, Urt River, Menhir Hills, Little Hillwood

**Communities **of **Note: Garham

This waterway, quite substantial in breadth but shallow and sluggish in flow, can be mistaken rather easily for the Urt River from north of the Greypools Mire—hence, its name. Its channel is no more than two miles distant from that of the Urt in this region, and no more than five miles further north. At one time the two streams were thought to be one, but careful mapping has made the difference between them distinct.


Although the upper reaches of the river are wild and dangerous, boats and barges can navigate the False Urt, from some 75 miles northwards all the way downriver to the marsh. In the mire, only very shallow-draft watercraft can pass through to gain the actual Urt River.

As is the case with the Urt, the banks of the False Urt River are generally more thickly grown than those of the Nemo, long stretches of willow bushes and other shrubs thickly clustered along its shores. Many copses and groves of large willows, or trees of other kinds, will be found on or near the waterway’s banks. These are generally seven to 10 feet high, though greater where the river cuts through hills that are more rocky and precipitous.

###### The Four Tors

**Encounter **Table: Hills

**Adventures: 6. The Hidden Message

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Westfields, Urt River, Yggsburgh, Yggsburgh College, Town Library, The Hidden Portal Nexus **Communities of Note:** None

This is a very visible geographical feature just north of Yggsburgh, about two miles from the west bank of the Urt River. It is comprised of a quartet of bald, rocky hills that rise abruptly to stand by themselves in an otherwise level area. The northernmost of the Four Tors is the highest, being about 600 feet above the surrounding plain. Each of the other three hills is successively lower, their upper elevation being 555 feet, 510 feet, and 465 feet, respectively, as one progresses southwards.

###### Greypools Mire

**Encounter **Table: Marsh

**Adventures: 23. Services and Rewards

**Zagyg Adventure Reference:** False Urt River, Menhir Hills, Urt River, Menhir Hills Road, Long Forest, Little Hillwood, Buckswood Hills

###### Communities of Note: **None**

This great bog is a marsh of some 42 square miles in area. Fed by the False Urt River, the area is never anything but a morass during even the driest of summers. There are scores of pools in the marsh, these being anywhere from 10 feet in diameter to great ones of near 100 feet. All are deep and have bottoms of soft mud, so that anyone unfortunate enough to fall in and sink to the bottom will be drawn down into that ooze and never be seen again. The smaller pools are the most dangerous, because detecting their presence in one’s path is difficult due to surrounding grasses, reeds, and like vegetation. A step on the bank of such a pool is certain to result in precipitation into the water.

There are many winding streams of water that crisscross the Greypools Mire, so that it contains many islands of boggy sort. In this morass are found eels, fish of usual sort, and the great leeches common to the region. Many aquatic birds make the place their home, and mammals such as the giant otter and black bear are found within it.

The fringes of the marsh are a thicket of weeds, such as thistle and burdock, and beyond that lower growth are many sorts of thorn trees.

###### Great Hillwood

**Encounter **Table: Wooded Hills

**Adventures: 27. Assignations and Assassinations

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Menhir Hills, Little Hillwood, Hidendale, Menhir Hills Road

**Communities **of **Note: Thorps General

The forest called the Great Hillwood stretches northwards 50 miles to the upper end of the Menhir Hills. It is, on average, 45 miles broad east and west as it spreads widely to the north, so the total area of the Great Hillwood is 2,250 square miles. It is mighty forest indeed, filled with great old hardwood trees and home to all manner of small and large animals. Game is plentiful because of frequent breaks in the tree canopy, due to windstorm and fire, as well as bedrock being close to the topsoil so as to prevent deep- rooted growth.

In meadow clearings there is fodder for herbivores, the prey of the woodland’s carnivores. All species of regional hardwoods, and some conifers, grow in the Great Hillwood. Ash and beech through yew, walnut, and willow are found here. Large animals living in this habitat include aurochs, deer, elk, and wild swine, as well as bears, large cats, gluttons, and wolves. There are within it some few communities of hardy woodsmen, demi-humans, and humanoids, the two former kinds often joining together to fight off the incursions of the latter.

The sole route through it is the Menhir Hills Road, and where it passes through this forest there are frequent patrols of armed men, so as to check banditry by humans and humanoids alike.

###### Great Leech Marsh

**Encounter **Table: Marsh

**Adventures: 24. Hauntings and Hillocks

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Bigfish Lake, Mound Island, Broadview Valley, Lakepens Hills

**Communities **of **Note: Garham

Only the western verge of this wetland is shown on the area map. It widens in its north-south dimension to the east, extends another 15 miles in that direction, and is over eight miles wide at its greatest extent. In all, the Great Leech Marsh spreads over an area in excess of 75 square miles, including the three or so square miles shown on the map.

In addition to the huge leeches for which it is named, the fauna found in it include the typical small sorts as well as deer, black bears, and giant marsh lynx. The larger mammals find the place a suitable habitat because of the many low little “islands” of dry ground with trees that are scattered about in the marsh. The fringes of the marsh are a thicket of weeds, such as thistle and burdock, and beyond that lower growth are many sorts of thorn trees.

###### Communities of Note: **None**

The Greenridge is a rise and series of hills that extend southwest 22 miles from the east central Menhir Hills. Thence it merges into the Buckswood Hills. For all but its southernmost two miles, the Greenridge is wooded and covered by the Long Forest. The ridge proper is between one and three miles wide, averaging two miles in breadth. It is relatively low, being between 50 and 80 feet above the surrounding plain. The hills along it are broad with gradual slopes, adding from 60 to 110 feet to the overall elevation. The highest point of the ridge is where it meets the Menhir Hills, the ridge elevation there being 80 feet, and the hills on it in the range of 90 to 110 feet high. There are no known valuable mineral deposits in the Greenridge.

###### Hiddendale

**Encounter Table:** Wooded Hills **Adventures:** 35. The Unholy Ringstones **Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Menhir Hills **Communities of Note:** None

This small, remote valley is located in the Menhir Hills, some 35 miles overland north and a little east of the Free City of Yggsburgh. The valley is an oval of three miles length by two miles width.

For some arcane reason it is very difficult to locate this vale, and even a ranger can miss it. Locating Hiddendale is difficult and can take some time. If traveling there without aid of some other type, a ranger must make a successful tracking check to locate it. The tracking check is made at -10.

More than a geographic feature, Hidendale is the site of an ancient holy place. Long deserted by human folk, elves thought to make it theirs, but in only a few years abandoned the area as unwholesome. Thereafter, gnomes began burrowing into the steep and rocky hills embracing Hiddendale, but they too gave off their colonization efforts when their numbers began to mysteriously dwindle. The last inhabitants of the valley were a small clan of dwarves who discovered traces of gold in the hills where the gnomes had dug their burrows. These dwarves knew the evil reputation of Hiddendale, but their avarice for precious metal clouded their judgment. They mined and began to bring forth large nuggets of pure gold. Soon, something happened to disrupt the harmony of the clan and they began quarreling and fighting amongst themselves. At the same time their numbers were shrinking from unexplained disappearances. A handful of survivors came into the town some three decades in the past, swearing the place was cursed, vowing never to go back despite the yellow ore there. Certainly there are strange things that slink through the valley at night…

About 25 miles east of Yggsburgh, along the River High Road, is the narrow dirt road known as Lakeham Lane. This road winds through the Broadview Valley, up into the Lakepens Hills and the Lake Woods, following the South Eel River to its source: Bigfish Lake. It ends at the community of Garham. The lane becomes known by another name, Quarry Track, when it leaves Garham. There is a fair bit of wheeled and other traffic on Lakeham Lane, although

most goods are shipped on the nearby river.

###### Lakepens Hills

**Adventures: 10. Lead and War, 9. Refugee

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Lake Woods, Long Forest, Greenridge

**Communities **of **Note: Garham

The Lakepens Hills lie east of Bigfish Lake, and are covered by a forest known as the Lake Woods. Beginning at the southwestern edge of the Great Leech Marsh, they run southwest for nearly 15 miles to where they are known as the Buckswood Hills. The Lake Woods no longer cover them after this point. The Lakepens Hills are a ridge line, in that they are nowhere more than about two miles broad, save at their northernmost portion. They cover an area of about 32 square miles, all of which are covered by the Lake Wood. The hills are somewhat steep and rise abruptly to tops ranging from 90 to 120 feet elevation. No valuable mineral deposits of any significance have been discovered here, although lead is found in small quantities on the surface near Garham. The hills seem to hold in the waters of the lake, but the derivation of their name—the “pens” portion—is actually from “hills.” With water, marsh, and meadows surrounding them, the flora and fauna of this place are highly diverse and plentiful.

###### Lake Woods

**Encounter **Table: Wooded Hills

**Adventures: 10. Lead and War, 9. Refugee

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Lakepens Hills, Long Forest, Greenridge

**Communities **of **Note: Garham


Lake Woods is a small forest whose extent generally matches the hills over which it spreads—the Lakepens Hills. This woodland is the habitat for elk, and both fallow and red deer. All of the usual small animals native to such woodlands are found within it, as are large creatures including wild swine, bears, large cats, and wolves. Its trees are old, and mainly of the deciduous kind, including: ash, beech, chestnut, elm, hickory, locust, maple, oak of various sorts, sycamore, walnut, and willow in the lower areas. Few hunters come to this place because of its remote location, and those that do originate mainly from Garham or are travelers that stop to seek game for food. The woodland is seldom troubled by marauding humanoids, little timber is harvested from it, and in general it is undisturbed habitat for game. A few foresters and wild elves dwell within these woods but usually keep to themselves.

**Adventures: 29. Red Bill and the Filthy Orcs

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Menhir Hills, False Urt River, Urt River, Greypools Mire, Old Castle Track

###### Communities of Note: **None**

This woodland lies along the southern portion, and towards the middle, of the Menhir Hills. Its southern verge begins near the Menhir Hills Road, about 16 miles north of Yggsburgh as the crow flies. The forest is, on average, 20 miles long on its northeast- southwest axis, and has an average width of eight miles. Its growth covers about 160 square miles of land. The False Urt and Urt Rivers pass through its north and central regions.

Along those waterways, and where the woodland borders the Greypools Mire, the trees are mainly great willows with some aspen and birch. Elsewhere, its growth is of typical forest hardwoods, from ash to walnut. Its fauna includes the usual small and large animals.

West of the False Urt River are found large numbers of humanoids, while east of the same river, demi-human folk have managed to place a foothold and keep out bandits, raiding orcs and their ilk.

###### Lonely Valley

**Encounter **Table: Grasslands

**Adventures: 30. Settlements and Burrows

**Zagyg Adventure Reference:** Menhir Hills, Greenridge, Urt River

###### Communities of Note: **None**

This fertile valley lies over 20 miles north-northeast of the town of Yggsburgh, in an area devoid of roads or tracks. It is some 10 miles long and two to three miles broad, so its area is somewhat greater than 25 square miles. Lying west of the Greenridge, the Menhir Hills forming its northern and western limits, the Lonely Valley runs a bit west of a true north-to-south axis, and its southern end turns due west for a bit more than a mile.

A handful of rivulets come from springs in the bordering hills, run generally southwards, one joining another to make little brooks, and eventually the two streams thus formed flow into the Urt River. No cultivation is in evidence in this place, and only grasses, weeds, and clusters of low-growing shrubs are seen. This is fine with the fauna; wild horses and a small herd of aurochs roam the valley and the surrounding hills and woods. Deer from the forests come into the valley at night to enjoy its fine pastures, as do bears and wild swine. The bears, along with great cats and wolves, also hunt the herbivores grazing in the valley and the ecological balance is thus maintained.

The only folk that dwell in proximity to the Lonely Valley are (were) a clan of gnomes who have their burrows in the hills at the valley’s north central edge, and a tribe of elves in the woods at the south end. Neither group welcomes humans, for if settlers come into the place everything will change drastically.

This is a typical woodland of the region. It is mainly composed of hardwood trees, with some scattered clumps of evergreens. There is little undergrowth, save in clearings and the occasional meadows within the forest where grasses, various small plants, and bushes are able to find sunlight to grow. The trees are mainly large and tall, with ash, elm, maple, and oak predominating, although some chestnut, elm, hazel, hickory, sycamore, and walnut are widely scattered in it. As is also typical, there are considerable fauna dwelling in the forest. This includes everything from shrews, moles, and mice, on through squirrels and rabbits and various birds, to large game such as wild swine, deer, and aurochs. As well, there are predators such as hawks, owls, bears, large cats, and wolves to be found within. A few woodsmen and wild elves dwell within its reaches; though they are rare, they can be found if diligently sought.

This is a vast stretch of large and rolling hills north of Yggsburgh. The portion depicted on the Yggsburgh map extends over approximately 2,000 square miles, but it extends east and west of the map area about 30 miles in both directions, as well as continuing north for some 50 miles. The average elevation in the lower southern portion is 80 to 120 feet, growing progressively greater northwards, where the hills average 180 to 350 feet in elevation, and attain heights of 600 hundred or more feet in a few locations. The greater elevations are steeper than the lesser ones to the south and at the verges of the area. They are wild and lonely highlands, populated sparsely by hill folk and demi-humans, troubled by raiding humanoids and more dangerous beasts, and rife with strange creatures that inhabit its more desolate places.

**Adventures: 19. Disappearances and Labyrinths, 47. Slaves or Good Eating

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Menhir Hills, Bigfish Lake, Broadview Valley, Longforest

**Communities **of **Note: Hillmen Hamlet

This waterway is large and fast-flowing as it comes down from the eastern Menhir Hills to empty into Bigfish Lake. It is not navigable more than about two miles above its mouth because of rapids and falls. The volume of water it discharges into the lake is considerable, but evaporation and seepage quickly reduce the amount, so that the river’s continuance at the outlet of the lake, the South Eel River, is only about half the size of the upper channel that feeds the lake. The banks of the North Eel River are low (2-4 feet) near its mouth, becoming steeper as one goes upstream into the Menhir Hills. There the sides are 5 to 10 feet above the water surface. Most areas of the banks are a tangle of bushy plants and shrubs, and willows of various sorts. Many trees grow in copses and groves near the water.

Its lower reaches are inhabited by the same giant fish and aquatic animals found in the Bigfish Lake, but it is home to much more than this. The upper portion of this river flows through a most wold and dangerous territory. The eels, fish, and other aquatic life forms found in the lower portion of this river are much the same as those inhabiting Bigfish Lake. Above Fallsford, however, the river fauna change to the more common sort, save for the incidence of large eels.

**Encounter **Table: Open Grasslands

**Adventures:** 31. Brothers of Giant Regard

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Long Forest, Broadview Valley, Greenridge, Lake Woods, Buckswoods Hills

**Communities **of **Note: Garham

This valley’s southern end is wooded, and lies at the edge of the Buckswood Hills about 10 miles northeast of Yggsburgh. From there it stretches northeast some 20 miles to the southern shore of Bigfish Lake. The little community of Garham is at its northeastern end.

The vale is from two to four miles broad, and its total area is about 60 square miles. Its flora are typical of the area, with a thick growth of grasses interspersed with weedy patches, clumps of wild roses, berry bushes, and shrubs such as sumac. Here and there a lone tree or little copse of them can be seen. The larger fauna here are found more frequently in the central portion of the valley, because of human hunters at the head and foot of the area. As with plants, the animal life is also typical—there are wild horses and a few aurochs, and occasional bears and wild swine near the wooded verges, where deer from the forests come at night to graze. The bears, along with great cats and wolves, also hunt the herbivores grazing in the valley. In general such predators have the place to themselves at night, as humans are not active in it then.


The Lord Mayor of Yggsburgh is even more covetous of Norvale than he is of the Lonely Valley. A road leading through it would enable enfeoffment of four or more knights with estates here, and this would serve as the base for further expansion of town lands, and also bring Garham under its rule. However, the free foresters and wild elves that dwell in the surrounding woodlands are determined to prevent the expansion of the town, knowing that knights and settlers will devastate the natural ecology, destroying it and their way of life. Thus, they drive out surveyors and turn back wandering families seeking to settle in the valley.

The entrance to this byway lies on the eastern side of the Menhir Hills Road, about 20 miles north of Yggsburgh. The track enters the Little Hillwood at the south central forest’s western edge. The overgrown lane wends its way 15 miles into the woodland to end at a bluff overlooking the False Urt River and Castle Zagyg. This byway is both difficult and dangerous to travel! It is peopled with nothing but robbers, roving bands of humanoids, savage beasts, and hungry monsters awaiting any who dare travel here. All sensible folk shun the Old Castle Track.

This place lies east of the Menhir Hills Road, at about five miles distance as the crow flies. Over the uneven terrain between the road and the trees, however, the actual distance is more like 10 miles, all of them difficult to traverse. Here, hidden amongst some of the larger rises of the Menhir Hills, the Old Oaks Grove lies in a bowl-shaped valley about a mile in diameter. It is a large stand of ancient oak trees. These trees are massive in girth, none less than eight feet in diameter, most larger than that. It is obvious to anyone familiar with woodlands that this grove is unique.

Old Oaks Grove is now the center for the Druidical faith. Four times a year the highest ranking Druid, Lochinvar Beechwood, the Lord Mayor of Yggsburgh, comes to this place to hold the sacred ceremonies of that faith for the worshippers of the region.

This dirt road runs out of Garham going northwest, and thence northwards, following the shore of Bigfish Lake for several miles before it bends east-northeasterly. After paralleling the lake’s shore for some four miles, Quarry Track turns northeast and winds up into the Menhir Hills. As it turns thus, there is a side area of hard- packed clay and gravel running to the shore of Bigfish Lake. The stones around here have been placed to form a jetty projecting about 50 feet into the water. This is where barges are loaded with rock and taken from the quarries northeastward—after about three miles in this direction, the road forks. The left-hand fork retains the name Quarry Track and, in about eight miles (just off the map by some two miles), reaches the actual areas where stone is quarried from the surrounding hills, Marblestead. Two miles further on is a similar community, Hewerton.

###### Communities of Note: **None**

The Richwood Forest covers approximately 90% of the northern East Uplands. Its woodland is of some 450 square miles in extent. Its eastern half is the private hunting preserve of the Marquis of Talworth, and forms the central western boundary of his domain. As is implied by its name, the forest is a most plentiful one in the way of flora and fauna. The many hardwoods include fruit trees growing on the verges, while within the forest’s heart nut trees of all sorts provide much food for animals. The breaks in the tree cover abound with grasses, herbs, and berry bushes. Thus, all manner of small and large animals are found here, including the usual ones taken as game—large birds, deer, elk, bear, large cats, wild swine, and wolves. Occasionally parties of woodsmen will venture into the verges of the forest to fell choice hardwoods such as beech, hickory, white oak and walnut. They take few, though, because wild elves dwell within the Richwood and drive out those despoiling it. This has led to some minor clashes in the east, where the Marquis holds sway.

This highway is the eastern continuation of the Dunfalcon Pike. However, it runs along the north bank of the River Nemo and is connected to Dunfalcon Pike only through the Free Town of Yggsburgh. The River High Road leaves Yggsburgh via the Moatgate and Moatbridge. It then goes east and northeast over 50 miles before crossing the upper Nemo River via the Bowbridge. Thence it goes onto the north shoulder of the East Uplands, and past the Great Leech Marsh. From there, it leaves behind the environs of Yggsburgh.

Some ten leagues eastward from that point, the River High Road’s name changes and becomes known as the March Road. From here, it is very rough and passes through an unsettled wilderness area. After about four days hard riding, or roughly 200 miles, it’s name changes again to the King’s Highway. At this juncture it lies within the realm of a royal monarch.

Villages of Broadview Valley

This waterway is, on average, 400 feet wide in the area of Yggsburgh and over 600 feet broad west and below the town. It is navigable by large ships from its mouth, some 250 miles west at Dunfalcon, all the way to Yggsburgh. To the east of Yggsburgh, its depth is such that only small ships and barges can navigate its channel to a point some 50 miles beyond the Great Leech Marsh, where it becomes too rocky and shallow at the town of Stoneford Meade to be navigable. Below the junction of the Nemo and Urt, the river’s current flows at two knots, so passage downstream is quite speedy and effortless.

The river has relatively low banks, with an average of 4-6 feet in height. They are somewhat higher near Yggsburgh. The banks of the river are generally open, with occasional long stretches of willow bushes and other shrubs thickly clustered along those portions where human traffic allows them to flourish. Now and then a copse of large willows or trees of other kinds will be found.

The eels, fish, and other aquatic life forms found in the upper reaches of the River Nemo are much the same as those inhabiting Bigfish Lake, although the really large sort are not often encountered in these waters (as they do not generally enter the South Eel so as to reach the River Nemo).

It is about two miles wide at its greatest width. It rises some 90 to 130 feet above the surrounding lands, with hills of 70 to 90 feet cresting it, and hillocks of 30 to 50 feet running along its outer stretches. It is generally grassy and treeless, with occasional clumps of shrubs and small copses of hardwood trees, such as oak and beech. There are a few isolated farms along the ridge, but to the east it is wild and lonely, grazed only by wild animals.

The main traffic on it are boats to and from Garham, and barges bringing timber and stone from the hill country.

The eels, fish, and other aquatic life forms found in this portion of the river are much the same as those inhabiting Bigfish Lake, although the really large sort are not often encountered in the waters of the South Eel. The banks of the South Eel River are generally low (2-4 feet) along most of its course. Most areas of its banks are thickly overgrown with bushy plants, shrubs, small varieties of willow. Many trees grow in copses and groves along the course of the river.

The Urt River is around 300 feet wide where it flows into the River Nemo at Yggsburgh. Going northeast, the river narrows somewhat, being about 200 feet broad where it passes the morass of Greypools Mire. Above the Greypools Mire the river remains relatively broad for some 50 miles. It is large enough that boats and barges can navigate northward to that distance. Above 70 miles distance northeast from Yggsburgh, the Urt River becomes very swift and has stretches of rapids that make it impassable to all but small vessels.

The banks of the Urt River are generally more thickly grown than those of the Nemo, long stretches of willow bushes and other shrubs clustered thickly along its shores. Many copses and groves of large willows, or trees of other kinds, are found along the waterway. Its banks are generally high, with 7 to 10 feet being the average, though they are greater where the river cuts through the hills.

This waterway is well-known for the giant otters that make its banks their home. Otherwise, the creatures found in this portion of the river are generally of usual sort, as the eels, fish, and other giant aquatic life forms inhabiting Bigfish Lake have not spread upstream in the Urt River.

This is a considerable meadowland lying some 20 miles to the east and south of the Free Town of Yggsburgh. This bowl-like meadowland is south and east of the Glittering Knobs, west of the East Uplands, and north of the Serpent Ridge. Its extent is around 6 miles north-to-south and 7 east-to-west, so it covers about 40 square miles of territory.

Grasses predominate in the shallow valley, but it is dotted about with copses of trees, breaks of tall shrubs and clumps of low- growing bushes. Although it appears relatively smooth, there are low ridges and hillocks in its basin, with many little gullies through which streamlets flow and not a few small ponds are located.

The eastern verge is farmed by a community of halflings, and in the south wild elves from the Dire Forest’s western edge occasionally roam in chase of game. Otherwise, the whole of the grassland is quite wild. All manner of small and large animals roam the mead. The lesser creatures found here include small game and game birds, hares, foxes, and mink. Larger sorts of wild cattle and horses, deer, wolves, and some few bear, giant cats, and wild swine can also be found.

###### Communities off Note: **None**

First, be it known that this woodland is certainly an enchanted place! Beginning some dozen miles north by northwest of Yggsburgh lies the Wynchwood. It is separated from the Ashwood to the south by a ridge of the Bald Hills. This forest’s average breadth is 40 miles and its average north-south depth is 20 miles. In all, it covers the very considerable area of 800 square miles, with only about 50 of that extent shown on the map. The northern verge of the woodland covers a portion of the Menhir Hills, but otherwise it grows on plains and gently rolling land. The trees comprising the forest are mainly hardwoods and, in addition to oaks and the other sorts typical of the region, there are apricot, bay laurel, cedar, cherry, fig, hornbeam, mulberry, myrtle, olive, orange, peach, pecan and witch hazel stands. Most of the forest is dense, but there are many small meadows and glens within it, and several pools and springs therein give rise to many rivulets and brooks that flow out of it to the west. Many grape vines are found around the clearings within the Wychwood.

The climate within the woodland’s precincts is mild even in winter. Frost never occurs, and any chill penetrating the woodland is quickly dissipated, as it is a warm place. However, in cold weather, the verges of the Wychwood are covered with fog. This is a light

fog at the forest’s fringe of low-growing vegetation, and thickens to a very dense cloud where the large trees begin. As one enters the area of thick vapors from the outside, a perceptible warming is notable as one proceeds deeper into the wood. Once through the heavy fog, about 100 feet into the woods, the air temperature is relatively mild and the fog dissipates. The enchanted ground on which the forest grows maintains a climate that never becomes truly cold or truly hot.

## Arrivals

†

Where you place the characters when beginning play dictates the specific details needed to know before play begins. Here are several suggested starting points for a party of 4th to 6th level. As the Castle Keeper, you need to devise a method to get the characters into the area. Other than knowing the manner in which they arrive, all you need is an initial destination point with which you are familiar and need not bother memorizing the remainder. You can read more between sessions and manage, in seat-of-the-pants fashion, quite well with the information supplied for the encounter area chosen.

In short, an effort has been made to lighten the burden on the Castle Keeper in regards to preparation, as this is an extensive module. Where it is expected that there is considerable character interaction with non-player characters, more background information regarding those persons is supplied. For a prime example see the extensive Outs Inn entry (Yggaburgh encounter 80. The Outs Inn). Most locations in Yggsburgh are not quite so detailed. Not only do space limitations call for brevity in descriptive detail but many campaigns do not stress roleplay and in those games which feature such interaction, the Castle Keeper often desires to develop details that fit his story and aims rather than those of the author. In short, ignore details that seem extraneous to you and freely alter those already here. Create what you like to suit your campaign and play style. As a Castle Keeper who prefers to “wing adventuring,” a few cautionary words: Be sure to keep notes on all that you create on the spot so there will be consistency in what transpires.

Once on the Urt, they soon arrive at Yggsburgh unless some encounter delays them. When at the docks of the town, they need to stop and if they are not inclined to do so themselves, have a storm, a sprung plank, or a patrol boat from the town ordering them to pull ashore for inspection and identification because of troubles with river pirates in order to force them to stop.

**East Hillway** The party is mounted and riding west through relatively wild hill country without knowing what awaits them further on. They are riding thus mainly to get to the big city of Dunfalcon where they hope to find challenging things.

**Purple **Tower **Road The party is moving west along the Purple Tower Road knowing a good deal about Yggsburgh. This is


because Lord Uvoll Darktran, the henchman of Marquis Talworth has commissioned the party to spy on the town and if possible foment trouble therein. This sly wizard, Lord Uvoll, lives in the Purple Tower, the frontier stronghold of Edgar, the current Marquis of Talworth. Lord Uvoll has supplied the party with a medallion that enables telepathic communication between the possessor and the wizard himself. This is enabled by pressing the crescent in the medallion’s central portion. He has also given the party a hand signal (thumb and forefinger held so as to form a broad U-shape) to which agents of Edgar Marquis Talworth will respond. Of course, the marquis and his henchman hope to soon capture Yggsburgh…and Uvoll hopes to be awarded it as his fief.

**River Nemo, downstream** The party is traveling by barge arriving in Yggsburgh as rivermen and not making a flashy entrance. Otherwise their seeming mission is as noted for Purple Tower Road.

# Part II : Yggsburgh Places of Import


Encounters in Yggsburgh

## 1.Yggsburg

†

Part II of this tome contains a description of all the places of importance in the Free Town of Yggsburgh.

Note that each entry is immediately follwed by brief descriptors noting location, reason (for going to the place in question), signs (if applicable) and a reference for the appropriate encounter tables for that entry (if applicable). The location of each place is further detailed within the text and located on the map. The encounter tables referenced are located in Appendix C, Urban Encounters. In some cases, the stats for non-player characters are not listed. This is not an omission. The stats for those non-player characters are located in Appendix I, Orders of Battle. Each entry should specify under which heading.

###### Armorial Bearings

The armorial bearings of the Free Town of Yggsburgh are cut into the stone above the entrance and painted in full color on many government buildings and structures. The text often refers to this. This escutcheon is of gold with a blue chevron separating two blue pikes (or luce, fish) above and a blue mailed fist at the base. Above the escutcheon is a crest of a city gate in gray stone crowned by a coronet of gold with five acorn-topped points. To either side of the escutcheon, supporting it, are giant lynxes standing on their hind legs with paws touching the shield. The motto below the escutcheon reads: None can deny us independence.

#### Townbridge


**Location: Bridgegate Entry to Yggsburgh

**Reason: Crossing over to enter Yggsburgh

This is a high bridge of five spans with the road atop—at its highest, some 40 feet above the waters of the River Nemo. Thus the road entering Yggsburgh from the Townbridge is at the same level as the gate and street beyond (Crossgates Avenue). The central span is a drawbridge section to allow tall-masted ships to pass up or down the river. The roadway along the bridge top is 14 feet wide, and where it is not of wood there is a parapet of three- foot height along either side. The last 20 feet of the bridge (as it enters the city) is also equipped with a wooden drawbridge, which is raised during hours of darkness.

The toll for crossing this bridge is: 2cp for a person on foot or a small animal, 5cp for a large animal (including a horse and rider), 1sp for a cart drawn by a single animal or pushed by hand (no charge for the person pushing it), and 2sp for a wagon drawn by one or two animals (all aboard the vehicle covered by the flat charge). Carriages and coaches, including passenger wagons, are exempt from toll charges so as to encourage such traffic in the city.

###### Adventure Hook

While crossing the bridge to town, the party sees a knot of armed men running toward them. They hear a hue and cry coming from the gate guards. “Stop! Thieves and murderers!”

The group fleeing to escape Yggsburgh are bandits, footpads and robbers who, in process of their crime, killed a wealthy burgher and the two servants who tried to protect him. Will the adventurers rise to the occasion and kill or apprehend the miscreants without harming innocent persons around them?

The Castle Keeper is to prepare opponents’ statistics appropriate to the level of the party for this encounter using Appendix I, Orders of Battle, Brigands .

#### Bridgegate


**Location: Townbridge entry to Yggsburgh

**Reason: Entering Yggsburg

The armorial bearings of the Free Town of Yggsburgh are cut into the stone above the entrance and painted in full color (see Armorial Bearings above). It offers a striking picture. This gate is in a rectangular gatehouse of 40 feet width, 25 feet depth and 35 feet height between and connected to flanking towers of 45 feet height and 30 foot diameter. It has a ground and upper floor. The upper floor and connecting tower floors are equipped to house a force of 30 guards. There is a substantial supply of quarrels, oil, and stones kept here for use in time of attack. On the front of the

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

gatehouse, at 20-foot height, there is a set-back of five feet with a ledge, with parapet and merlons, that allows defenders to issue onto it from the towers and assail foes threatening the gate. Above it, at 35 feet height, is a crenellated roof battlement. On the top of each flanking tower is an easily movable scorpion (ballista) manned by a crew of three when in action. On the top of the gatehouse is a catapult manned by a crew of six when in action.

The gate opening is protected by a drawbridge and beyond it, a portcullis. The twin gate portals have a 7 foot width and a 14 foot height. They are made of iron-bound oak that is eight inches thick, locked by bolts in the stone and as well as by a cross-bolt and heavy oak bar. At the end of the 20-foot passage through the gatehouse is another portcullis. To the sides of the passage are loopholes for archery, while above it are murder holes, for missile discharge, dropping of rocks, and pouring out boiling or flaming liquid.

The front walls of the gatehouse are solid stone to four-foot height, thereafter three feet thick. All other walls are one foot thick, with added plinths to support the first floor and roof. The rooftop is strong enough to a mount a large siege upon.

The flanking towers are 30-foot diameter, 45 feet high and are solid to six-foot height. Thereafter they have walls that taper from 5 foot to 3 foot thickness at their top, where there is the usual 3.5-foot high parapet and 3.5-foot high merlons, each of three feet width. They are pierced with loopholes along their winding interior staircase, and have five additional loopholes on each of their four interior floors—ground at 6 feet height, first at 16 feet, second at 26 feet, and third at 36 feet. Behind the gatehouse and its pair of flanking towers is a 100-foot wide and 90-foot deep paved area. This little plaza has avenues of 40-foot width leading off to the left, the right and from its midpoint.

There is a secret door in the rock face just above the water line immediately to the west of the base of the bridge. This accesses the Thieves’ Underground (see Yggsburgh Encounter 53: The Thieves Guild, Area 9).

There are at least 14 soldiers on active duty at the gate. There are actually 28 in residence.

###### Encounters in Yggsburgh

Toll cost to non-citizens for entering the town is 5cp per wheel of a vehicle, per person on foot, and per large animal, small animals on foot such as goats, pigs and sheep are charged at 1cp per head. At sunset the drawbridge before the gate is raised, the gates shut and barred, and not until dawn are they reopened.

During the hours that the gates are open, there will be a dozen vendors’ stalls and carts set up for business with another dozen peddlers carrying trays of their merchandise about. Added to these sellers will be a like number of beggars (there being no restrictions on begging here). A handful of these are soliciting sex, while some performers seek free-will payment from those who watch their acts; these include musical performances, singing, juggling, sword- swallowing, fire-breathing, tumbling and acrobatics, story-telling, sleight of hand legerdemain, and occasionally performing animals such as dogs or a bear.

As would-be entrants approach the gate via the Townbridge (see Yggsburgh Encounter 1, Townbridge, page XX) they see a small crowd of people awaiting the exit of a wagon from the gatehouse passage. As it leaves there and comes towards them along the bridge, they will note two men in tabards with the town armorial bearings upon them that are collecting tolls from persons exiting and entering. There are also a half-dozen town guardsmen armed with halberds on the way near the entrance. These soldiers occasionally stop a person, ask some questions, then wave the individual to pass on into the town or call for their serjeant—who might in turn call an officer. Watching from atop the gatehouse are two more guards with crossbows, and there are a like pair of watchmen on each flanking tower.

#### Moatbridge


**Location: East entry to Yggsburgh

**Reason: Entering Yggsburgh from the east

Where the East Road comes to an end at the Yggsburgh Canal, there is a partial causeway on the east side of that waterway leading to a long drawbridge. This causeway allows access to the town through the Moatgate and thence onto Eastgate Avenue. The structure—causeway, stone-wall pier to the west, and drawbridge—is collectively called Moatgate. There is no toll charge for using this bridge-way.

###### Adventure Hook

As the party crosses Moatbridge, they hear a commotion. If they look down they see a houseboat on which several armed men are fighting while a few more attackers climb up from a large skiff to the boat’s deck. Others seeing the melee are simply hurrying onwards…

The Castle Keeper can have the attackers as watchmen in the process of arresting criminals, thugs attacking the houseboat to kill and rob its owners, or a dispute between criminal factions. In only the second case will the party likely come out as heroes, of course. Otherwise they will end up in trouble for interfering with civil authorities, or else be marked by one gang of criminals even as they are thanked by another.

Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

#### Moatgate


**Location: East entry to Yggsburgh

**Reason: Entering Yggsburgh via the Moatbridge

The Moatgate is identical to the Bridgegate and conforms in all manners, from the escutcheon above the gate to the cost of entry, number of guards and defenses (see previous). There is even a secret door in the rock face of the moat just a foot above the waterline immediately to the south of the base of the Moatgate pier, which accesses the Thieves’ Underground (see Yggsburgh Encounter 53. The Thieves’ Guild, Area 10).

#### Rivergate


**Location: North entry to Yggsburgh

**Reason: Entering Yggsburgh from the north

On the riverbank before this gate is a stone quay 900 feet long (from near the base of the wall tower east of the gate to near the base of the wall tower to the west) and 40 feet broad. In the water beside it are wooden pilings for vessels to moor. Small boats are tied up at the quay’s ends and along the shore near them, where there are wooden piers. Several vessels are moored at the quay each day.

At any given time there are 1-4 large riverboats, 1-4 barges, 1-4 small ships, and 6-24 small boats. Mooring fees at the quay are 5cp per foot of vessel length, and no vessel may remain for more than one day. Pier mooring is free for one day’s time, otherwise 1sp per day thereafter.

At a distance of 100 feet from each end of the stone quay there is a ramp of 20 feet width hewn from the rock upon which the city stands. These ramps incline upwards 20 feet over a 300 foot distance to arrive at a plaza in front of the Rivergate. This open space is 100 feet long and 60 feet wide north to south. Along its edge are four derricks with great winches and pulleys. These are for the hoisting up of cargo from barges and ships. To go from it into Yggsburgh, one must pass through the Rivergate.

The Rivergate is identical to the Bridgegate (see 2 above), and conforms in all manners to those gates from the escutcheon above the gate, to the cost of entry, number of guards and defenses. There is a secret door in the rock face just at the edge of the Rivergate quay, in the outer plaza. This accesses the Thieves’ Underground (see Yggsburgh Encounter 53. The Thieves Guild, Area 13).

As would-be entrants approach the gate via the ramp ways and attain the outer plaza, they will note carters carrying goods both up from moored vessels and down to load upon them, while a small crowd of people stand back from the gate passage as they wait for the exit of one of these drays. As it leaves there and comes towards them along the plaza, the characters will note four men in tabards with the town armorial bearings upon them that are checking the wagons for contraband goods, as a half-dozen town guardsmen armed with halberds look on. These soldiers occasionally stop a person on their own, ask some questions, then wave the individual to pass on into the town or call for their serjeant—who might in turn call an officer from the gatehouse.


#### Yggsburgh Canal


**Location: Between the Urt and Nemo Rivers

**Reason: Entering Yggsburgh by boat, or seeking travel by boat

The Yggsburgh Canal serves as a moat, as well as a canal, linking the Urt and River Nemo east of their confluence. This waterway is 100 feet wide for its entire length of one mile. Its bottom is dug down 40 feet to bedrock, and its banks are of worked stone so as to ensure no erosion of them.

Where the East Road comes to an end at the Yggsburgh Canal, 1,200 feet north of the River Nemo, there is a partial causeway on the east side of the waterway. This stone structure is built on arched piers, the five openings between spans being 12 feet wide, with three-foot thick piers. This covers 78 feet of the canal’s width. On the western end of the causeway there is a long drawbridge, 20 feet in length, set into a projecting stone plinth that juts out three feet from the outer face of the town’s Eastgate. This structure, causeway and drawbridge are collectively called the Moatgate. In time of siege the drawbridge is raised, of course.

Numerous small watercraft, boats and barges are allowed to moor along the eastern side of the Yggsburgh Canal. Some of these vessels are the private property of wealthy townsfolk, some commercial, but a large number are boats and barges in which common folk have their homes. No watercraft are allowed to tie up on the western side of the canal, so that at all times there is ample room for traffic in both directions on the waterway.

###### Adventure Hook

When traveling along or beside the canal, the party notices a large riverboat manned by especially villainous-looking crewmen. If they pay attention, they see the vessel tie up in a place between two similar boats, and shortly thereafter hands from the newly arrived craft are seen going aboard the two boats they moored between. These are river pirates, and they are here as part of a plan to attack and capture several mineral ore barges that will be coming down the Nemo River from the Glittering Knobs. The raiders plan to board the ore barges as they enter the canal and kill or throw overboard the crews. Then they will sail west to Dunfalcon and dispose of the ships, where they hope to reap a great sum from this piracy.

The characters will need to do some investigating at the Boatman Tavern in The Outs Inn (see Yggsburgh Encounter 80. The Outs Inn) to get pertinent information about the pirates, their whereabouts and other useful facts. Luckily for them they have a full 24 hours to discover the plot, because the arrival of the shipment of minerals is a day behind schedule. Thwarting the piracy should earn them a decent cash reward from the mineral factors whose barges and cargoes are thus saved.

The Castle Keeper should prepare the details of this encounter, being sure to keep the party’s level in mind.

**Location: As shown


#### The Citadel

###### Encounters in Yggsburgh

Courtyard: generally 470’ north to south, 90’ across toward the west, with stables along the east inner curtain wall, with stalls for 60 horses, hay and feed stored in the loft above the

This is the barracks for the town’s regular military force. There are nearly 400 guards and soldiers who are equipped, housed and paid by Yggsburgh. Above the entry is the coat of arms of Yggsburgh.

Both the marshal, Sir Reginald Dunstone, and constable, Sir Macronald Weyforth, of the town have offices and quarters on the ground floor here, they being hired soldiers akin to general officers. The garrison consists of the following troops (note that many will be assigned to other posts and not be in their main barracks): a squad of 12 guards and two officers are assigned to guard the person and palace of the Lord Mayor. Normally, three sections of 28 men (84 total) are on duty at each of the three gates, and these troops are under the command of the porter. There are 68 troops stationed in pairs in the wall towers, with a roving patrol of 4 men on each of the three walls (12 total). At any given time there will be only 124 soldiers, plus some officers and non-combatant staff, within this building. Of that number, 26 will be on duty guarding: the gate (6), the entry and interior building (6), the towers (4), the walls (6), and the Great River Tower (4).

The entire staff and retinue of the Citadel are detailed in Appendix I, The Citadel. There is a wide variety of troops and troop types, so be sure to examine this Order of Battle carefully.

The Citadel is the great keep of the town and a castle-like fortress. It has a relatively small basement area (50’ x 300’) dug into the bedrock it stands upon, its ceiling being the ground floor that is five feet above the level of the courtyard. The basement has a well bored down to water level, and its chambers are where fuel and provisions are stored. Above the ground floor are two additional stories, one at 20’ and another at 35’. The kitchens are on the ground floor, as is the garrison refectory and the offices and chambers of the marshal and constable. The other officers and men are barracked on the first floor and in the great tower. The upper floor is basically open and used as an armory and storage place, as well as for exercise and arms practice in bad weather.

In the chapel sacristy are stored 24 healing elixirs restoring 4-16 hp each, and 12 gold altar service pieces worth form 300-1500gp each.Length and height of east curtain wall: 480’ and 35’

The armorial bearings of the Free Town of Yggsburgh are cut into the stone above the entrance and painted in full color, as described for Bridgegate (see introduction above).

On the top of each citadel tower are two easily movable scorpions (ballistas), manned by crews of three when in action.

On the top of the citadel’s roof are four catapults, one more on the roof of the great west tower. Each catapult is manned by a crew of six when in action.

Clues about various places or names can be found here with the requisite research. If a character spends a day searching for a particular topic, an intelligence attribute check should be made to determine if they were successful in finding it. This check can only be made once per day per topic searched.

The check is modified depending on the topic heading searched. The Environ Encounter number and title is contained in parentheses. Go to that encounter area to see what the entries are concerning it. The check can also be modified if the librarian is bribed. For bribes over 10gp the attribute check is made at

items be donated. If that is refused, he bargains to get the item at 25% its value, then 50%, then 60%, etc.

However, if the characters donate any item with a value of 1,000gp or more, they will be named in a Town Proclamation for their community spirit and be acceptable in Upper Middle class circles. If the donation is of value above 2,500gp, they will be invited to a banquet at the Mayor’s Palace, introduced to the Counselors, and thereafter, if socially acceptable, become temporarily popular amongst the aristocracy and invited to their functions—hunting, banquets, balls, etc. A gift of any great rarity or ancient artifact will gain the characters Honary Citizenship in the town, with all the foregoing lionization applying, and their favorable station will persist for several months unless they do something to discredit themselves. If they continue to do beneficent and/or heroic deeds, they will be further honored, possibly asked to join the Lords & Gentlemens Club, awarded armorial bearings, knighted, etc. as the Castle Keeper sees fit.

The Work House is located in the triangle across from the government buildings block formed by Lower Market Street and Plaza Avenue. It faces both the Yggsburgh Library and the Museum as it extends south of Neargate Lane 120 feet. It is a very large and tall building with a 120 foot frontage, four stories and a basement underneath.

The Work House has a staff of 14 guards and 16 servants. The office of the Warden of Debtors is located here. He is in charge of the Work House and income paid down on the debts by inmates. There is an average inmate population of around 170 persons.

#### Yggsburgh College & Schools


**Location:** The area bounded by North Wall Avenue, Scrivener Street, School Street, College Street, and Grand Avenue

**Reason: If the characters are seeking information, advice, scholarly help or other academic pursuits

This area is bounded by North Wall Avenue, Scrivener Street, School Street, College Street, and Grand Avenue. All of the main buildings and the playground for the schools front on the northwest to southeast streets—Scrivener, School, and College.

All college buildings bear a coat of arms carved into the stone above their main entrances and painted in full color. The arms are a quartered escutcheon, two quarters showing the arms

of Yggsburgh (gold with a blue chevron separating two blue pikes—or luce, fish—above and a blue mailed fist at the base) and two quarters of different sort, the upper left being gold with a torch burning red, the lower right being 12 pales of black and white. Above the escutcheon is a crest of a city gate in gray stone crowned by a scholar’s cap of gold. To either side of the escutcheon, supporting it, are owls regardant (full-face towards the viewer). The motto below the escutcheon reads: Knowledge cannot be denied.

The following is a brief description of the layout of the school complex:

Scrivener Street, west side from North Wall Avenue to Grand Avenue

High School with about 200 students Middle School with about 250 students Children’s School with about 300 students

School Administration & Faculty Housing building

School Street, east side from North Wall Avenue to Grand Avenue

Gymnasium Schools Playground Auditorium

School Street, west side from North Wall Avenue to Grand Avenue

Academy of Arts with about 200 students Academy of Music with about 150 students Academy of Learning with about 550 students

Student Alley between School and College Streets running from North Wall Avenue to Grand Avenue)

Four student dormitory buildings on both the east and west side, for a total of eight

College Street, east side

Academy of Magic with about 100 students College Library

College Refectory

College Administration building

College Street, west side (southeast from West Way to Grand Avenue in Wealthy area)

Senior College Faculty Building Dean’s Manse

College President’s Manse

All the schools here are private and pupils pay tuition.

The professors at the Academy of Magic serving here are non- combatant magic-users of 13th, 10th, and 9th level, with one illusionist of 11th level on staff. The library of books containing spells covers 70% of combatant-type spells used by adventurers, but all of those are in a locked room reserved to faculty only. Training is mainly in spells used for commercial and residential purposes. A very generous donation to the college might enable perusal of a tome of magical writings, of course.

###### Encounters in Yggsburgh

###### College Library

If the party has a member able to utilize the College Library, that individual will be able to discover such information as the Castle Keeper determines would be found in such a facility.

This includes the information regarding Mound Isle gained from a student’s paper regarding unusual local fauna. This textual description is located in the Part II, Yggsburgh Environs, Encounter 4. Mound Island.

There is also information on the Four Tors and the Hidden Portal nexus. The textual description is located in Part III, Yggsburgh Environs, Encounter 6. The Hidden Message.

###### Adventure Hook

A couple of college students from the fraternity, having heard about their adventurous exploits, call upon the characters for help. A group of new students went on a scavenger hunt of sorts for initiation. They didn’t come back. The students ask the adventurers to find their mates and bring them back safe, relating the “secret” of The Hidden Portal Nexus, described in Environs Encounter 6. The Hidden Message.

#### The Common Temple


**Location: Fisher Street

**Reason: If the characters seek to worship or are looking for divine aid

**Encounters:** Temple Grounds and Within the Temple Complex Events

The temple should be dedicated to a deity or deities of the Castle Keeper’s choice, keeping in mind this is where the common people go to worship. This temple is located at the intersection of Fisher Street and North Wall Avenue in the far northeast corner of the town. It is a modest-sized temple and grounds where many of the common folk of the town attend religious services. In addition to three exterior shrine buildings, there is a small school in the compound where bright children of the poor are educated for four years at no cost to the parents. This temple also has a hostel where the poor are fed and housed for up to three days at no charge while the priests seek out places for them to work and obtain low-cost living accommodations.

If this is made an active area for play, then a map should be created. The lot area is 500’ long on the south, and 400’ north- south on the east. The right angle thus created is connected by a wall running from the northeast to the southwest where a short western north-south wall of 50-foot length meets it. The temple should be in the neighborhood of 60 feet by 100 feet, the shrines each 30-feet square while the school building and the hostel are each of two stories and 45 feet by 75 feet.

There are 6 dedicated clerics, 34 lay staff, and those being cared for on the grounds average 60 persons at any given time. So the total population of the complex at any given time is about 100 individuals. The Chief Priest is the Venerable Albert Goshert. The other priests are decribed below. They are titled ‘Pious’ and all mainly have helpful spells.

#### The Outland Temple


**Location: Southeast corner of Fisher Street and Newgate Lane

**Reason: When demi-human characters are seeking spiritual guidance

**Encounters:** Temple Grounds and Within the Temple Complex Events

This temple is located at the southeast corner of Fisher Street and Newgate Lane, a block from the Moatgate on a lot 500 feet east and west, 250 feet north and south. The deity or deities to which this temple is devoted are left to the purview of the Castle Keeper. This moderately large temple and grounds is where most of the small demi-humans (dwarfs, gnomes, and halflings) and foreigners in Yggsburgh attend services. The temple has three large shrines within it, and its clerics number 16, with a lay staff of 24 giving a total population of 40 persons.

The Chief Priest is the Venerable Reginald Viner, a person not given to combat except in the most dire of circumstances. The other priests’ levels and brief descriptions are enumerated below. The Castle Keeper should decide the race of each depending on the deity or deities chosen for the temple. In all cases, few of the membership are given over to warfare and fighting, and usually help in clerical duties and have spells that enable them to do this.

The 16 Priests serving here are:

Chief Priest, the Venerable Reginald Viner _(He is a chaotic_ _good, humau, 9th leeel cleric whose eital stats are: HP 39, AC 11._ _His prime attributes are: str, wis, cha. He carries padded armor,_ _eestmeuts aud a staff. He cau cast the followiug uumber of clerical_ _spells: 0-5, 1st-4, 2ud-4, 3rd-3, 4th-2, 5th-1.)_

#### Fane & Convent


**Location: Moat Avenue

**Reason: Worship or divine aid

**Encounters:** Temple Grounds and Within the Temple Complex Events

This temple should be dedicated to a female deity or deities of the Castle Keeper’s choice, keeping in mind this is where the common people go to worship. The temple is located in the far southeast corner of the town on the block between Moat Avenue and Fisher Street on the east and west, bounded by Wood Street and South Palisades Avenue on the north and south. This is a relatively small temple with extensive grounds that are the base (about 500 square feet) for the activities of the dedicated nuns of the convent. They dwell in the convent buildings and serve the community in various ways.

Most of the half-elves and elves dwelling in the town attend services at this fane. There are 4 priestesses, 8 ordained nuns, 66 lay nuns, and 12 staff located here. There is a total population of 90 persons at any given time. The High Priestess is the Supernal Diana Silva. She and the other priests are detailed below. They are not given to combat and generally have helpful spells.

**Location: Market Plaza


#### Temple



Encounters in Yggsburgh

#### Chapel & Priory


**Location: South Palisades Street between the Black Tower Land

**Reasons: Worship and other religious activities

**Encounters:** Temple Grounds and Within the Temple Complex Events

The temple should be dedicated to a female deity or deities of the Castle Keeper’s choice, keeping in mind this is where the common people go to worship. The temple is located on the western side of the Market Plaza. It is bounded on the west by Company Street, between Central Street (where it turns east into the plaza) and Citadel Way to the north and south. The lot dimensions upon which the temple grounds sit are 750 feet east-west and 225 feet north-south.

This large temple and grounds is attended principally by the middle class and merchants of the town as well as like visitors to Yggsburgh. On the grounds is a special shrine where those in need of sacred care of a magical sort are attended to at all hours of the day and night.

There are 10 priests here with a large lay staff of 40. So there is a population of 50 persons here at any given time.

The chief priest is the Venerable Trevor Darmley. He is not given to combat save in direst of circumstances. All priests are described below. They usually have helpful spells and avoid combat if possible.

Trevor Darmley _(He _is _a _ueutral _good, _humau, _10th _leeel _cleric_ _whose _eital _stats _are: _HP _41, _AC _11. _His _prime _attributes _are: _str, wis, _cha. _He _carries _padded _leather _armor _aud _staff. _He _cau _cast the followiug uumber of clerical spells: 0-5, 1st-4, 2ud-4, 3rd-3,_ _4th-3, 5th-2.)_

to the east and Friars Lane to the west

**Reason:** Should the characters be searching out religious guidance, training or help, the priory may be able to offer some or all

**Encounters:** Temple Grounds and Within the Temple Complex Events

The Chapel and Priory are located at the southwestern edge of the town along South Palisades Street between Black Tower Land to the east and Friars Lane to the west. The chapel and priory have a north boundary of 500 feet, an east boundary of 400 feet, a west boundary of 250 feet and a southeast-northwest boundary of about 600 feet. The large chapel on the grounds is open to worshipers, but is mainly for the Order of Gray Friars that dwell in the several buildings of the priory compound. The chapel and priory should be dedicated to a male deity of the Castle Keeper’s choosing.

The friars teach religion and general subjects here on the grounds, where pupils board. They also circulate through the town and go into the countryside to preach and teach. Thus, about half of the membership of this community are away at any time. Within the compound at any given time are two ordained priests, 12 ordained friars and 40 lay friars. There are an equal number outside the compound, in the surrounding countryside, or around the town attending to business or teaching. Additionally, 16 acolytes, 10 staff, and 70 pupils are in the compound at all times. The entire population of the priory averages 150 persons.

Prior the Venerable Aloysius Flaherty _(He _is _a _ueutral _good,_ _humau, 9th leeel cleric whose eital stats are: HP 34, AC 11.

#### The Grand Temple & Monastery


**Location: Triangle formed by Grand Avenue, Citadel Avenue and Temple Street

**Reason:** Should the characters be in search of religious favor or spiritual needs

**Encounters:** Temple Grounds and Within the Temple Complex Events

The Casstle Keeper is to decide the pantheon and the principle male deity honored. A brief description of the temple is offered

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

below, but the Castle Keeper should decide the final architectural style of the structure. It should be remarkable and distinctive. It might have a central dome, great outer pillars and the truncated cone entrance might be a massive pylon-shaped structure. Also, there might be towering corner spires, or the central portion might be broader and taller that described below and stepped. Whatever suits the pantheon chosen, and the Castle Keeper’s creative fancy, is fine. Just make it spectacular.

This great religious complex is located in the extensive triangle of land between Grand Avenue and Citadel Avenue, with Temple Street as its eastern boundary. The Grand Temple is in the western end of the area. Its entrance has steps 20 feet wide funneling out to the 40-feet wide north-south west wall, with the walls angling northeast and southeast from that entrance to a rectangular main area of 70 feet width and 140 feet depth to the east. This main building is 50 feet high, open to the roof. It has colonnaded side aisles of 15-foot width over which runs a railed, open balcony with a floor 15 feet above the main one. There are shrines under this balcony along either wall, and above them are windows to let in light. There are three low wings appurtenant to the main temple: left, right, and behind the east altar. The lot dimensions are, along the east boundary 1,250 feet north to south with lot lines then running southwest and northwest from that boundary to meet at a mid-point 1,000 feet to the west. The grand manse of the High Priest is located on the temple grounds in the southeast corner of the triangle.

The Grand Temple is where most of the aristocrats and college personnel, faculty and students attend services. Also on the walled grounds is a large monastery, a number of the monks of this community being teachers in the nearby schools. The priests of the Grand Temple number 12. There are 20 ordained monks, 148 lay brothers and 40 acolytes, with a total population of 220 at any given time.

The High Priest is The Supernal Victor Oldham (also a member of the Town Council). He is aided by the Venerable Abbot Gregor Osmark and the Pious Priest William LaRoc.

Victor Oldham _(He _is _a _lawful _good, _humau, _14th _leeel _cleric_ _whose _eital _stats _are: _HP _59, _AC _22. _His _prime _attributes _are: _str, wis, cha.

#### The Upper Gardens


**Location: North Yggsburgh on Grand Avenue

**Reason: Relaxation or clandestine meetings

The Upper Gardens, those in the north of Yggsburgh, are about 250,000 square feet in size. There is a good deal of room in the park, but loitering by lower-class folk is not allowed and all vagabonds daring to set foot in it are arrested and taken to the Gaol (see Yggsburgh Encounter 10. City Gaol). The only exception is on the weekly holy day when anyone is allowed in the gardens.

This place is a clean and carefully landscaped area meant only for better-off citizens. To enhance its beauty, there are artistically arranged flower beds, blooming shrubberies, and rows and small clumps of trees spaced around the verge of the central lawn. In the latter portion there are only a few great shade trees and an ornamental pond. The pond is filled with flowering water plants, while large coy swim within and turtles bask around a small fountain that sends up four jets of water to plash into the central part of the large pool.

There are two bronze statues of Lord Yggs near the park’s Grand Avenue side. One is of the noble founder of the town in full armor seated on a rearing destrier with sword in hand. The other is of His Lordship seated on a throne with an open scroll, on which is the decree that the town be made a free one.

There is a secret door in the base of the statue of Lord Yggs seated on a throne. This accesses the Thieves’ Underground (Yggsburgh Encounter 52, Thieves’ Guild, Area 6).

#### The Lower Gardens


**Location: South Yggsburgh near Citadel Avenue

**Reason: Relaxation or clandestine meetings

The Lower Gardens, those in the south of Yggsburgh, are about 250,000 square feet in size. There is a good deal of room in the park, but loitering by lower-class folk is not allowed and all vagabonds daring to set foot in it are arrested and taken to the Gaol (see

Yggsburgh Encounter 10. City Gaol). The only exception is on the weekly holy day when anyone is allowed in the gardens.

This place is a clean and carefully landscaped area meant only for better-off citizens. To enhance its beauty, there are artistically arranged flower beds, blooming shrubberies, and rows and small clumps of trees spaced around the verge of the central lawn. In the latter portion there are only a few great shade trees and an ornamental pond. The pond is filled with flowering water plants, while large coy swim within and turtles bask around a small fountain that sends up four jets of water to plash into the central part of the large pool.

The two bronze statues here are on Citadel Avenue. One is a group of five idealized townsfolk cheering Lord Yggs, who is clad in noble costume with a coronet on his brow. The other is of four soldiers, one with a crossbow, the other three with shields and halberds. The shields display the armorial bearings of the town.

The central portion of the park has a large fountain and shallow pool, plus a moderate reflecting pool in front of a hexagonal, white marble gazebo in memory of Lord Yggs. About 100 feet distant from the memorial is a very unusual statue of a lovely woman; people come to this figure often, for it is known as the Oracle Statue.

There is a secret door in the center of the marble gazebo. This accesses the Thieves’ Underground (see Yggsburgh Encounter 53. Thieves’ Guild, Area 6).

###### Adventure Hook

The Oracle Statue: The statue of the beautiful smiling woman arrayed in a formal gown (of a wedding style from a time long past), with a laurel leaf crown and a bouquet of roses, that stands in the center of the South Gardens is most unusual, for no one knows how it came to be where it is. This statue is composed of an unknown translucent metal.

The reason it is called the Oracle Statue is that sometimes the sculpture is known to speak. The statue radiates a magical aura of indeterminate sort. People have been known to ask the oracle questions, and sometimes the oracle responds by glowing and with animated face and mouth. This makes it very popular with the common folk, and many people come here regularly, hoping for an answer. Sometimes it will speak on its own with no prodding.

This is a trick, however. A potent illusionist has set up this scam—the illusionist observes people here, and will secretly cast an illusion that is akin to a magic mouth, responding when certain conditions are met. His goals are random—sometimes he will actually do a good dead, other times he will try to manipulate an aristocrat or wealthy person to provide some benefit to him financially (usually indirectly), and sometimes he just has the statue make random and vague proclamations for amusement.

What the illusionist doesn’t know is that there is more to the statue. Donated from a private collection, the statue is actually a powerful succubus forced into a form of binding, one who took human form and tried to trick a powerful wizard into a romantic relationship. The wizard discovered this trick and created a trapped laurel leaf crown to force the demon into its current state.

###### Encounters in Yggsburgh

If the binding can be broken—likely by trying to destroy one of the illusionist’s enchantment—the creature will be freed, not knowing what happened, but “grateful” to the person who freed her, and may likely try to form a “romantic relationship” with a member of the party, to serve her own evil ends. If she gets information from townspeople about her “oracle” status, she might try to exploit that for her own needs as well.

**Encounters: Audience Chamber or Great Hall Events

This residence is located on the east side of Scrivener Street between North Wall Avenue and Grand Avenue. The residence is a brick and stone building with two stories and an attic. It is vaguely similar in architectural style to Georgian construction. It is on a lot of 300 feet frontage. The 100-foot-wide mansion has two small wings and is centered upon the lot. The lot is walled on all sides. Above the entrance to the mansion is Sir Morgan Nalbord’s coat of arms. This is a field of six bars of alternating red and gold, each bar bearing three black pellets (black dots).

The family is comprised of Sir Morgan and Madam Dorthea Nalbord and their five children. The household staff consists of an usher, housekeeper, valet, lady’s maid, nurse maid, cook, scullion, two footmen who double as waiters, upstairs and downstairs maid, groundsman, coachman, and groom. Nalbord is usually careful to have an esquire with him.

Unless one or more of the characters calling here without invitation are knights, they will be turned away. The only exceptions are if the characters are renowned in the town for their daring exploits and good deeds or bear news of financial or political interest to Sir Nalbord, especially with regards the Brick Works, which he owns. This knight manages to do fairly well from interests in manufacturing and trading enterprises in the town (see Yggsburgh Encounter 86, The Brick Works).

On formal occasions the knight rides on his warhorse; otherwise he is with his family in a coach or carriage. When alone, he rides or is afoot. He is usually accompanied by his esquire, mounted or afoot as is the case with his master.

#### Tower of the Striped Mage


**Location: South Palisades Avenue

**Reason:** Ordinary folk shun this place. But when the party is seeking high-level magical spell-casting upon their persons, or is in need of training, or wants to trade magic items for others, this is the place to go

The Tower of the Striped Mage is located on South Palisades Avenue in the middle of the block between Offmarket Lane and Company Street. The ashlar block tower is painted in spiral stripes of red and white, a truly bizarre decoration (see below). It is a great hexagonal structure that is 50 feet wide per outer face, five stories high, with a hexagonal penthouse of 30-foot-width per face that

reaches another 20 feet height. The tower is thus one of the tallest structures in the town. On the south face, where the main entry to the tower is, there is a 12-foot-wide crenellated stone balcony at 18-foot height that projects five feet out and over the door stoop, and has machicolations. It is flanked by two bartizans of eight-foot diameter, and accessed from the second floor of the structure.

The “decoration” was originally done by an outraged monk in retaliation for much abuse by the Head Apprentice, and out of frustration at being unable to get back at him or his master. Upon seeing the colorful paint decorating his tower, the wizard liked it, thought it properly distinctive and adding considerably to the overall appearance of his domicile, so he placed an enchantment upon it so that would remain thus indefinitely. To enhance the effect, he decided to wear striped apparel henceforth and adopt the style of “The Striped Mage.” This, of course, absolutely crushed the would-be retaliator, and no more attempts at getting even were made.

The tower stands 40 feet from the front of a lot that is 120 feet wide and 180 feet deep. It has all manner of magical protections, of course, so successful breaking and entering, even in ethereal form, is nearly impossible. The physical characteristics of this place, in précis, are described below.

The property is walled to 10 feet height, with a funnel-like opening leading to the front entry. The opening is 30 feet wide at the sidewalk, running back 25 feet to a 12-foot wide, 15-foot deep flight of 7 steps and an 8 foot deep landing before the entry, the latter overlooked by the balcony described above. There is a large door of iron-bound oak with a gargoyle’s-head bronze knocker in the center, but no other features.

When the heavy bronze gargoyle’s head is lifted upwards and let go, or brought down with force, it emits a horrible groaning growl. In one- to four-minutes’ time someone responds to the knocker’s sound. Roll a d6 and consult the chart below to determine who responds. Then refer to their entry.

**1-4	The head apprentice of the Striped Mage appears on the balcony above

1. A bronze golem opens the door saying no one can come, return another time
1. The Striped Mage answers the front door

The stats for the inhabitants of the tower are listed at the end of this section.

###### Arrivals

**The Head Apprentice**This fellow is garbed in a rather dandy fashion, looking more like a young aristocrat than a studious wizard, for he is also tall, well-built, and handsome with long blonde hair and blue eyes. Rodrigo (see below for stats) is his given name, and he is arrogant, a prankster and not a little greedy. Whenever callers come, regardless of how many times he has seen them previously, he inquires from the balcony about the nature of their business, noting that “My master is a very busy

###### Encounters in Yggsburgh

man who hates to be interrupted by antic outlanders,” and similar demeaning terms for the visitors. Vary this “greeting” for each visit. If the characters demand entry in insulting terms, he is likely to pull various magical pranks such as those listed below, and the Castle Keeper should feel free to invent as many more as desired. Roll a d8 to determine which prank is played.

1. A shower of flowery cologne is precipitated upon their heads.
1. A swarm of biting midges fly around their heads.
1. The stone underfoot grows hot and uncomfortable to stand on.
1. The footwear of the party emits the odor of manure.
1. Stoop and steps shift to a slippery slide that sends the party tumbling down.
1. A stone slab appears where the door was as a jeering cry sounds loudly.
1. The party begins laughing and sound like braying asses for a full minute.
1. The party’s noses begin running, and they sneeze for three rounds.

Attacking the Head Apprentice results in his disappearing inside the tower as a rain of fiery acid splatters the front entrance area. This precipitation inflicts d4 acid and d6 fire damage on all who are on the stoop, stairs, or entry walk, no saving throw affects the outcome of the damage. Each attack upon the Head Apprentice increases the number of dice of such damage by one, to a maximum of six each. In short, it doesn’t pay to assault this fellow.

What the Head Apprentice expects is deference from the characters, and then a bribe. Given unctuous politeness, despite his sarcasm and rudeness, and no less than 5gp, he then goes and sees if his master will see the visitors. Assume there is a base 50% chance the Striped Mage will see the party, and that each 5gp given in bribe money increase the chance by 10% due to the wheedling of the Head Apprentice, the maximum probability being 90%. Refusal to see visitors is irrevocable, but a “Call again at this time tomorrow” means that the party will be received grudgingly by the Head Apprentice, shown to the smallest reception room of his Master, and that the worthy wizard will then attend to them in 2-20 (2d10) minutes time (see page 59).

**The Bronze Golem** This is a unique man-like statue of some seven feet height, some four feet wide at the shoulders and very quick of action. Should the characters offer any problems for the golem, they may be in for some trouble (see page 59).

**The Striped Mage**True to his more recently assumed name (he formerly styled himself The Mage of the Tower), Cerdamont Tasjornivand wears gaudily striped robes and other garments. He might also appear in a velvet cape of green and purple vertical stripes, worn over a violet robe bound by a spirally striped sash of rose and gold. Similarly, he might be decked out in a horizontally- striped fine wool mantle of black and fuchsia, trimmed with ermine worn over a knee-length silk gown of sea green, with hose horizontally-striped yellow and russet, and slippers of turquoise- hued felt (see page 58).

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

###### The Tower

**Basement The basement has storage and laboratory rooms.

**Ground **Floor The ground floor has the usual formal rooms for a mansion—foyer, salon, dining room, lounge, study, library, kitchen, pantry.

**The **Upper **Stories** upper stories are primarily the apartments of the master with two guest suites. The second floor has the apartments of the Head Apprentice and two Apprentices plus a lounge hall for all those being trained. The third floor rooms are for Junior Apprentices and study rooms. The fourth floor is generally open and used for the practice of magic casting.

**Roof** The roof turret is the master’s astrological workroom and stellar observatory.

This eccentric magic-user is always busy with some experiment or the development of a new and likely strange spell. He is not averse to assisting the adventurers who call upon him, but he considers his time as highly valuable, so he demands payment for any and all services. He will not supply magic items to the party, but he will trade one of his for one or more magical items provided by the characters, such exchanges always at a profit for the wizard. This is left in the hands of the Castle Keeper, but no number of potions and scrolls should buy any potent magic item that functions continually, such as a magic sword or ring. He will gladly purchase magic items from characters, paying full value for them without haggling.

There is no Mages’ Guild in the town, as there are only a dozen wizards of note that are all employed in teaching or commercial enterprises, the latter being where their students go to practice their new profession after graduation. This place is as close as one can come in Yggsburgh to finding a wizard willing to assist other mages or adventurers…for a price.

###### Service	Cost




to paralyze the Striped Mage so as to steal his choicest magical things. When that failed, Dalbid Yeerouf managed to escape by use of a ready spell. In revenge, Yeerouf managed to lure one of the apprentices of The Striped Mage into his shop, suborned her (so she stole from her master), and caused her to bring several purloined items of considerable value with her when she came to learn “greater lore” from Yeerouf. For her pains, this unfaithful wizard was paralyzed, the stolen goods and all she owned along with them went into Yeerouf’s coffers, and soon thereafter she was sold as a slave.

The Striped Mage’s one weak point is Dalbid Yeerouf. If the characters mention dealing with him and evidence any liking for him, they will be expelled from the wizard’s tower and never allowed back. If, on the other hand, they indicate true dislike of Dalbid Yeerouf, the characters will be treated with camaraderie, the fees charged them cut in half. Any plans they might have for attacking and killing Yeerouf will be aided by suggestions and even loans of enchanted objects that might assist in their successfully doing away with this deadly adversary of The Striped Mage.

The Striped Mage: Cerdamont Tasjornivand, is a resident alien and as such is not eligible for any official position in the town, and were he, the wizard would not be interested in serving.

The Head Apprentice, Rodrigo de la Novorra, is like a son to the Striped Mage. And Rodrigo feels much the same, so he serves faithfully. He is always short of spending money, as his “father” is very parsimonious. The Head Apprentice not only wants to have some accumulated wealth, but plenty of spare cash to spend on occasional flings involving wine, women, and song. Thus his exactions of bribes from all who seek to call upon his master.

The statistics for the inhabitants of this location follow. However, don’t worry about details of how the inhabitants of this location manage everything. This place is as much for you, the Castle Keeper, to have fun with as it is for the characters to get assistance. Part of the “fee” paid is your playing fast and loose with the characters, making them the butt of jokes and such. Under no circumstances should you ever allow the party to get the better of anyone here, let alone capture or kill them, or loot so much as a single magical draught. If you want a character to be able to learn a new spell, the Striped Mage has it in his library’s grimoires

and like tomes. If you want a character to have a magic-item, the Striped Mage has it in his hidden store…for trade at a juicy profit. Otherwise, the spell or item is not possessed by the Striped Mage.

The apprentices of the Striped Mage are virtual non-entities who are, at best, shadowy background figures moving about caring for the place or seeing to their master’s commands. Note that two of the apprentices are attractive young females. Statistics for the bronze golem are given above but it is a nonesuch and virtually unbeatable for purposes of this work.

###### Encounters in Yggsburgh

Using the cover of a house of astrology, the “12 Celestial Houses” is the shop from which the Assassins’ Guild operates. As assassination is illegal in Yggsburgh, mention of such a guild in upper class circles will bring disdain and suspicion, along with immediate assurance that no such thing exists in the town. People of the middle class will likely report to the authorities anyone asking about an assassin or guild of them. In lower class areas everyone will be “deaf and dumb” when asked. This is done easily, as 95% know nothing at all except vague rumors. Only counselor Horace Linnfield is fully aware of the operation, and he is well paid to keep it quiet.

Only the criminal underclass has any real inkling of the actual existence of the Assassins’ Guild. If inquiries are made in a low dive such as the River Rat Tavern (see Yggsburgh Encounter 59. River Rat Tavern) there is a 10% chance per person asked with a 5gp bribe, that someone will let slip the name of the astrology shop. Each additional 5gp added to the bribe adds 10% to the chance of learning the name. Each inquiry is also cumulatively 10% likely to call the “snoopers” to the attention of the Assassins’ Guild’s membership. If the inquiring party is suspected of being bent on revealing the organization, then they will be marked for “an accident,” and the Beggars’ Brotherhood and Thieves’ Guild will spy on the party continually until they are killed, or word is passed that they are all right (see Yggsburgh Encounter 51, The Beggar’s Brotherhood, and 51. The Thieves Guild).

The Assassins’ Guild is secretly allied with the legally recognized Thieves’ Guild, and may call upon them for help in time of great difficulty. There is a secret door in this building’s cellar that leads to the Thieves Guild (51. The Thieves Guild, TheThieves’ Underground, area 8). The twelve assassins here are all aware of this, use the route, and know the underground areas it leads to.

###### Beggars’ Brotherhood


**Location: Hammer Street

**Reason: When the party is interested in being generous and helping the poor

The Brotherhood is located in the middle of the block on the north side of Hammer Street, between Moat Avenue to the east and Fisher Street to the west, and faces warehouses to the south. It is a newer but rundown brick building with 60 feet of frontage, three upper floors and a loft. Next to the double entry doors are two square signboards with a crutch painted on one and a beggar’s bowl on the other. Crudely lettered above each is: “Town of Yggsburgh, Brotherhood of Beggars.” At the bottom of each board is written: “Help for the truly unfortunate.”


The ground floor front is taken up by a “greeting room” with a shabby old desk, cabinet, a few battered chairs, and benches. There is a door to the upper floors at the right hand (NE) back corner of the room, and a center door leading to the rear of the floor. Well-meaning citizens stopping by to offer a contribution of money, to donate old items to the Brotherhood, or inquiring about the Brotherhood removing junk from their premises, are treated with unctuous politeness by the “Greeter” seated behind the desk and thanked profusely and continuously while in the place. “Brother Beggars” are sent directly upstairs, or to report to the Beggarmaster, whose quarters occupy the rear of this floor.

If the party is interested in being generous and helping the poor, or suspicious that this group is linked with all sorts of crime in town, they will eventually find themselves here. The Beggars’ Brotherhood is indeed allied with the Thieves’ Guild, and may call upon them for help in time of great difficulty.

Membership in the Brotherhood requires an inspection of person and display of begging style and tricks. The Beggarmaster and his henchmen observe, and pass or refuse applicants. Members must pay over 75% of all they gain by begging, and in return they are housed, fed, and protected. However, consistent failure to pay over a daily average of 1gp in coin or stolen valuables means expulsion in short order.

**Beggarmaster’s **Quarters There is a small anteroom for callers to await the leader’s attention. To the right of it is a door leading to the office of the Beggarmaster, where the stairs to the basement are accessed. To the left is the door to his dining room. Behind the two latter rooms are his bedchamber (left) and personal lounge (right). All of the furnishings in this area are second-hand, shabby and tawdry.

Only the Beggarmaster, one-armed “Alf” Drumly, and his henchmen, the lamed “Gimpy” Wakeman, Chief Beggar, and the one-eyed “Squints” Gillicary, Expert Beggar, and members of the Brotherhood are able to fight. There are, at any given time, another 2-20 each male, female, and child beggars in the building.

**The **Basement The basement is also accessed from a wide outside ramp. The basement is mainly given over to great piles of old furniture and junk, this coming and moving out to secondhand store proprietors and junk men regularly. The front part is walled off and has a secret entrance. In here is stored stolen goods from the Thieves’ Guild, brought via their underground tunnels, and left until it has “cooled off” or can be smuggled out hidden amongst old junk. Here the Beggarmaster, “Alf” Drumly, keeps his store of wine and liquor. The Thieves’ Guild pays a small amount for hiding stolen goods here, that pocketed by Drumley, and hires the Brotherhood’s members to spy and serve watchers to give warning to thieves at their nefarious work. There is a secret door in the west wall that opens onto a passage that runs generally northwest some 1,800 feet to the Thieves’ Underground (see Yggsburgh Encounter 52, The Thieves Guild).

**The **Upper **Floors This is where the members of the Brotherhood meet and have quarters. The two fireplaces on each floor serve for such cooking as is done, and only the lowest of new members

do not have a pallet of sorts to sleep on where there is some warmth in times of cold. These unfortunates are sent to the loft high above to make their beds.

Individual beggars have from 1-10sp in various coin on their person. The chief’s henchmen and able-bodied beggars will have a purse with 1-4gp per level or hit dice. The only portable wealth is in the quarters of the Beggarmaster. “Alf” Drumly has a small iron coffer with a poison needle trap (10-60 HP damage, halved if a save vs. poison succeeds) on it. It is kept in a hidden space in the wall concealed by a firewood box. The interior of the space is dark, and six small poisonous spiders have their webs therein. To get the coffer out, Alf puts a lighted lamp into the space, and in a minute or two the spiders hide, and he can reach in safely and get the box. Without this precaution, anyone reaching in is subject to 1-6 spider bites delivering 7-12 poison damage each, no save, but damage occurring at 1 point per three rounds after the bite, per bite suffered.

The iron coffer contains 500sp, 500gp,

20 pieces of jewelry worth 10-60gp each, and a pouch with 30 gems with a base value of 25gp each.

1. “Value Second Hand Market” or the Thieves Guild

**Location: South side of Craft Street between Middle Thoroughfare and Crossgates Avenue

**Reason: When the party is seeking to root out evil, recover stolen goods, or fence some they have purloined

The Value Second Hand Market is located in the middle of the block on the south side of Craft Street between Middle Thoroughfare and Crossgates Avenue. It is in the alley adjacent to the building that runs north to south from North Wall Avenue to Hammer Street. The building is of ordinary brick, is three stories tall plus a loft, and has a frontage of 90 feet, the eastern 30 feet of


which is divided off.

The Value Second Hand Market occupies two thirds of the entire building up to but excluding the loft. Many folk shop here because they believe that they are getting really expensive stolen goods at bargain process. Seldom is that the case. The basement has used items of a large and durable sort such as metal and wood containers, furniture, and bigger sorts of tools such as axes, picks, shovels, and sledge hammers. There is a back room used for the reception and sorting of used items purchased for resale. Another much larger room is used to refurbish those items. The ground floor has clothing and smaller furniture, hampers and baskets, with table and kitchen wares in the back. The first floor has various pieces of larger furniture including tables, chairs, stools, benches, cabinets, cupboards and cases. The second floor has lighting, bedding, draperies, curtains, mirrors and decorative objects.

The Thieves’ Guild proper has only a curtained front window and a small sign beside the entrance door with the following inscribed upon it: “Benevolent Society for the Betterment of the Masterless.” Even though the town allows licensed theft, receiving a 20% “tax” from all such “income,” the Thieves’ Guild does not want to flaunt their activities and enrage the citizens, so it has the Value Second Hand Market as a front. Thievery

in Yggsburgh is a complex matter, and the Castle Keeper should read Part I, The Culture of Yggsburgh, Crime and Punishment, for more details on the operation of thievery as a whole. Suffice it to say, much of the stolen property in Yggsburgh passes through the Value Second Hand Market, for resale here or in Dunfalcon City.

All floors of the Thieves’ Guild have concealed doors accessing the adjoining second-hand store. These doors are in out-of-sight places so the thieves can slip in and out without being seen. There is a secret entrance to the Thieves’ Underground in the basement. There is a concealed panel that accesses the adjoining buildings’ rooftops.

**Ground Floor** Upon entering the Benevolent Society for the Betterment of the Masterless there is a reception and office area of 27-foot width and 20-foot depth. Inside is a bench under the

window and a long table in the middle of the back half of the room, with two chairs before it and a man seated behind it who greets entrants. There are three doors in the wall behind this desk table; the one in the left corner opens to the basement staircase, the center one to a hallway leading to offices, and the one in the right corner leads to the steps to the floor above. Member thieves entering this way give the recognition sign and password, and may pass on through any of the doors their status allows. Only higher ranks may enter the ground floor offices. Ordinary folk calling here are asked to be seated at the desk table, so as to state their name and business. According to their wants—recovery of stolen goods, purchase of some specific type of stolen goods, to give a tip on a likely prospect and gain a “finder’s fee,” or to ask how to become a member—the Ollie Compolli (trusted lieutenant, see stats hereafter) manning the reception desk escorts them to an office, or in the case of an applicant for membership, sends them to the basement to be grilled and tested by the thieves there in the Thieves’ Cant.

The two rooms behind the reception room are fair sized, and the “Rum Fixer,” head of the Racketeers, and the “Lord Protector,” head of the Extortionists, are usually in their offices part of each day. Behind these offices is a large lounge and bar for the higher- up thieves.

**Firts **and **Second **Floor The first and second floors of the building are lodgings for mid-rank members of the guild. There are four rooms on each floor. The loft floor is very large, of course, has a large practice room, and dormitory sleeping spaces for 30 persons.

**Basement** The basement has a bar, refectory, and kitchen for all members. A storeroom adjacent to the kitchen has a false tun, its spigot in front yielding wine, but a secret panel in its right rear opening to a spiral staircase leading to the Thieves’ Underground (see below).

There are 21 chief members of this guild. Each is a head of a criminal activity as noted. A boss of this sort may have only a few persons in his mob, or there might be many. The total membership of this organization exceeds 1,000 persons including prostitutes. Of the membership, 80% are 1st level thiefs, 10% are 2nd level thiefs, 5% are 3rd level thiefs, and the remaining 5% are of low-level dual class fighter/thief 2/3 or 4th level. The latter does not include the top echelon or Ollie Compolli rank (described below).

The Castle Keeper will note that the Thieves Guild can be developed in much greater detail. This detailing is left in the Castle Keeper’s hands, so as to allow personalization according to your vision of the Thieves’ Guild. A helpful guide to adding great depth to the complex workings of the underworld is “The Canting Crew,” penned by me and published by Troll Lord Games. There are many underworld activities that can be used as sub-plots for the characters’ adventures, or even the adventures themselves. For example, slavery and the clandestine movement of captives into and out of the Thieves’ Underground can be developed into a major adventure involving the characters.

###### The Thieves’ Underground

This place is not easily discovered by the characters. The most likely way to discover its existence is if one or more of the characters become members of the Thieves’ Guild. They might visit the Green Dragon Inn and, by bribing one of the main non- player characters, learn of the underground and even how to access it from the Lower Gardens park. There are other means, though. The party could be doing detective work, watching for smugglers, noting them at night moving goods from a barge or boat into the town through one of the secret entrances near the gates. As the arbiter of all, the Castle Keeper might also decide to allow other means. Someone at the Bureau of Records might know about the place and reveal information. Perhaps a particularly wild college student might have seen some thieves using the secret entrances in the parks. Even a drunken member of the guild might be pumped for information and let slip that there is a system of hidden passages. Whatever you decide upon is what is right, as it is your campaign.

The tunnels in the complex are six feet in width, with a height of seven feet at the sides and 10 feet at a barrel arch in the center. The map is not as fully developed as it could be. Critical areas are shown and explained, but a more extensive system of passageways could exist and should be detailed as per the Castle Keeper’s wishes.

1. **Circular Chamber** These chambers are 12 feet in diameter. The central part is an iron grate of three-foot diameter. Half of it is hinged so as to be raised to allow access to the sewers via a shaft of about six feet depth. Iron rungs enable descent to the sanitation tunnels, with a standard secret door (see S, below) leading from this shaft to the sewers proper. All around the grate are stone flags that serve to trigger the release of some hazard. Each circular chamber has, at random, one of the hazards, traps or encounters listed below. Roll a d6 to determine which one. Members of the Thieves’ Guild jump across the area in two bounds, one to the center of it, then out. They avoid dead end chambers of this sort, as they are always trapped.
1.1. **Gas Release** This invisible gas acts in one round on all within the space, or who enter it during the next minute. The effect is to confuse direction sense for the next 10 rounds, so that anyone affected cannot correctly determine compass

points, or even right and left, unless a successful constitution saving throw is made at -10. The Castle Keeper secretly rolls for the actual direction taken by the character if they are confused.

1.1. **Rats A swarm of 24 starving rats attacks the characters.

Rat Swarm x24 _(HD1d1, HP 1, AC 14. These rats attack as 2_ _HD _mousters. _They _haee _oue _attack _aud _cau _ouly _delieer _1 _poiut of _damage _if _successful. _Uuless _a _successful _coustitutiou _saee _is made, _the _eictim _coutracts _a _disease _aud _suffers _the _loss _of _1 _HP_ _per _day _uutil _the _disease _is _cured.)_

1.1. **Liquid Glue Release** A flood of clear glue flows out to cover the stone floor in one round. This cement becomes tacky and slows movement by half on the second round after release, and on the third round it has become so sticky as to glue whatever is in contact with it in place. At such juncture, movement is impossible for anyone who has it on his shoes or feet. The stuff loses its adhesive strength in one minute, and thereafter it becomes mere dust.
1.1. **Spider Swarm A swarm of 24 spiders drops from above, landing on characters in equal numbers.

Spider Swarm x24 _(HD _1d1, _HP _1, _AC _17. _The _spiders _attack_ _as 5 HD creatures. Their bite cause uo immediate damage but, _a hit iudicates the eictim has beeu poisoued, aud iu oue miuute_ _suffers _a _loss _of _1-6 _hit _poiuts _uuless _a _successful _saee _es. _poisou _is_ _made, iu which case they suffer 1-3 hit poiuts damage.)_

1.1. **Darts** Darts fire from overhead such that each character in the area is attacked three times. Each dart attacks with a

-2, though the opponent receives no dex modifier to their armor class. Each dart causes 1 point of damage and delivers a sleep-inducing toxin that, unless a save versus poison is made, causes the victim to drop into a comatose sleep for one hour. They cannot be awakened before that except by administration of a stimulant.

1.1. **Light **Spell A double-strength light spell is triggered. The sudden illumination effectively blinds all in the area for 2d4 rounds, reducing any movement attempted to one-quarter normal walking speed and in a random direction.
1. **Traps** A trap is activated when someone steps on the central part of the passage in this location. These traps are one of the two types listed below:
1.1. **Pivoting Floor** A section of the floor opens to drop the lead character six feet down a chute, wedging the victim fast in the funneling shaft. Small subjects go farther down than larger ones. Pulling the victim free takes 10 rounds, less one round for each special means employed to hasten this, such as oil or grease and strength.
1.1. **Iron **Grate Iron grates with sharpened tongs drop to close off a 10-foot-long section of the passage. Any subject in the path of the falling bars is automatically hit and suffers d20
###### Encounters in Yggsburgh

points of damage. If a 20 is rolled, the victim must make a save versus death or die, and take another d20 points of damage, with the process repeating in the event of yet another 20 being rolled.

The barred grate can be lifted up by three persons with combined strength scores of 45 or more. It can also be levered up to a sufficient height to allow crawling beneath it. To do so, two poles or spear-like shafts employed by characters with a strength of at least 12, and who each weigh at least 150 pounds (less 10 pounds for each point of 12 strength), must be used as levers to lift the grate. Once lifted, the grate must be held in place with something, such as a mace, torch, or spikes wedged beneath it so as to prevent it from falling back down.

There is a chain hidden in a niche in the wall some five feet outside the trap area. Pulling down on it causes the grate to rise to its concealed position overhead. A successful wisdom check at -5 indicates it has been spotted.

**S. **Secret **Door Each such hidden panel is a slab of stone that is six feet high and four feet wide. When its hidden catch is triggered, a push causes it to pivot silently on a corner hinge so as to open or close easily. Unless otherwise indicated, the trigger mechanism is activated by inserting a dagger in a hole at two-feet height above the floor, above a pictogram of a rat crudely inscribed in the stone. Unless one is aware of the general location, a careful search is needed to discover this marking.

###### Thieve’s Guild Underground

1. **Staircase** This is a 20 x 20 foot square room, with a small spiral staircase leading above to the Thieves’ Guild headquarters building via the false tun. The room appears to be a dead end, a place for hiding out only, with two cots and bedding, a table and two chairs, and several hooded candle lanterns hanging from wall pegs as if to illuminate the place. That there are eight such lanterns here should provide a clue that they are meant for something else.

There is a secret door in the room. This swinging panel operates by triggering a catch when a dagger is thrust into a small hole in the middle of the west wall in which is stuck a peg, seemingly to hold another lantern or perhaps some article of outer clothing. The peg can be removed easily, a dagger inserted, and the catch is then triggered so that a four-foot-square section can be pushed open to provide an egress to the tunnel outside the room. On the outer side of the secret panel there is scratched a small pictogram of a rat. Directly above it at four feet height is a hole for dagger insertion to trigger the catch.

If successfully searched, a character will note the empty peg on the inside of the room and the pictogram of the rat on the outer side. Otherwise, a character lacking the noted skill must make a wisdom check to notice either, with one check allowed per 10 minutes spent examining the area.

1. **Safe **Room This room is 20 x 20 feet square and accessed by a secret door. This place is simply a safe haven for thieves eluding pursuers. There is a plugged spyhole slit in the wall at one-foot

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

height. When opened, it allows view of the passage outside, and the watcher will be able to hear loud sounds or normal talking close by. Inside the room are a tinderbox, hooded candle lantern, large cask of water (at the bottom of which are hidden four healing potions), box of hard biscuits, and four pallets.

###### Spriggans’ Complex **, 3.-5.

The Thieves’ Guild has enlisted the aid of a troupe of spriggans (detailed hereafter) to serve as spies and lookouts for their nefarious activities. These malign little people are quartered in relative luxury in the three rooms indicated. When alerted to strangers, or if they are surprised, they become invisible and seek to group together to attack en masse. If this troupe is eliminated, the Thieves’ Guild will replace it with at least as many new spriggans in 2-4 weeks time.

When attacked, the spriggans become invisible and assess the intruders’ potential for harming them. If that seems strong, they remain unseen and seek their fellows for help so as to have as large a force as possible in a fight. They then attempt to ambush the foe or otherwise attack by surprise. When attacking, they first attempt to touch and thereby confuse their opponent. When two spriggans face an opponent, one attempts a touch to confuse the enemy, while the other attacks with a weapon. In the next round, the other armed spriggan uses its touch while the other attacks with a weapon. In this manner they will be able to strike at least two unopposed blows. In all they are not warriors, and when half of their number has been slain the remainder of their troupe will flee.

1. **Common Room** This is a 20’ x 20’ foot room with three doors. At any time there are 5-8 spriggans in here. The room is furnished with tables, chairs, and various accessories sized to these creatures. There are cushions scattered about the place too. There are small food service items, with remains of food and drink on one long trestle table. Three small tables have burning candles on them and gaming items—dice, cards, and dominoes of diminutive size. The troupe leader is in this room.

1. **Barracks **Room This is a 10’ x 30’ room, with a door to room 3 above. This is a concealed, spriggan-sized escape hatch behind a screening cabinet. There are no lights in this chamber. The cabinet holds 60 small flasks, 20 full of whiskey, 30 empty and 9 with sleeping draughts. The sleeping draughts, once imbibed, cause up to 8 persons to be knocked unconscious one round after drinking them, the effect lasting for one hour unless a save vs. poison at -3 succeeds. There is also one concentrated healing potion that can be taken as four separate doses, each healing 2d4


points of damage. The spriggans have 12 bunk beds stacked three high, and under the bottom of each set are three small hampers with their spare clothing and (worthless) personal belongings.

1. **Kitchen This is a 10’ x 20’ room, with a door to room 3. It is a concealed, spriggan-sized escape hatch to the south and hidden behind a screening barrel of flour. There are 10 spriggans minus the number encountered in Room 3 preparing food here. There is

a fireplace with a fire going in the center of the west wall, a work table and work bench, various boxes, sacks, and small barrels of foodstuffs supplied to the spriggans by the thieves.

Spriggan, variable _(HD _1d8, _HP _7, _AC _17, _PA _physical, _EQ_ _dagger, two darts aud 2-12gp, Special: iueisibility, coufusiou.)_

1. **Passage to Upper Gardens** This passage leads to the Upper Gardens. It winds westwards some 1,500 feet, then turns southwest for about 300 feet, ending in a staircase leading up to a secret door in the base of the statue of Lord Yggs seated on a throne. The secret door is operable as are the others here, but the trigger is to the right of the stone slab on the inside, and to the left on the outside. The slab is three feet wide and four feet high, and swings inwards.
1. **Passage to Lower Gardens** This tunnel continues southwestwards some 500 feet, then turns west about 1,500 feet, to end in a flight of steps leading up to a secret door in the floor of

the hexagonal marble gazebo in the center of the park. The secret trap door is only two feet square, and operates by depressing the trigger using a dagger blade so as to cause the catch to allow the slab to drop a foot and then slide aside. Then slid back into its central position the triggering mechanism will cause the stone to rise up and seem like solid flooring once again.

1. **Chamber** This is a 20’ x 40’ chamber with a dwarf here 90% of the time. Holgar is a champion warrior and expert engineer. Holgar works for both the thieves and the assassins. He is the last of the dwarves who were hired long ago to help construct the Thieves’ Underground. His main wealth is in Mercantile Bank, where he has something in excess of 25,000gp deposited. He goes into the town above now and then to drink and carouse with leading thieves, most likely at the River Rat Tavern or the Dwarf Brewmeister Tavern.

The chamber is lit by two hanging lanterns. It has a fireplace on its west wall, a table with an unlit candle and four chairs around it, food cupboard with cooking and eating utensils included, a large bed with mattress and bedding, cabinet for clothing, an arms rack with six javelins in it, and ceiling-to-floor wall shelves to both sides of the doorway, on which are four gallon jugs of hard cider, 11 helmets (trophies of his major kills), and assorted empty wooden boxes of cheap sort, all save two empty. The best of the lot holds 100sp, another of cedar holds 200cp. The actual purpose of the shelving to the north of the entry is that of a ladder accessing a secret way to the Assassins’ Guild. This is a concealed trapdoor in the ceiling above that opens onto a three-foot-wide, seven- foot-high passageway leading east about 1,000 feet. This opens by secret door into the cellar beneath the Assassins’ Guild building (see Yggsburgh Encounter 50. The 12 Celstial Houses).

Holgar _(He is a ueutral eeil dwarf whose eital stats are: HD 7d8,_ _HP 42, AC 20. His prime attribute is: physical. His siguificaut_ _attribute _is: _str _20. _He _carries _+1 _plate _mail, _+1 _shield, _3 _jaeelius, broadsword, _500gp _iu _coiu _iu _a _purse, _aud _he _wears _a _ueck _chaiu_ _of _heaey _gold.*)_

*This is a neck chain with the 12 signs of the zodiac as pendants, each set with a small cabochon ruby, the whole being worth 2000gp. It is an emblem of the town’s Assassins’ Guild, and it marks the wearer as a friend who has committed no less than 12 killings on behalf of that organization.

1. **Passage to Bridgegate This tunnel continues southwestwards some 5,000 feet, then turns southwest about 100 feet to end in a secret door. It is in the rock face just above the water line, immediately to the west of the base of the bridge. The secret door is operable as are the others here, but the trigger is to the right of the inward-swinging stone slab on the inside, and to the left on the outside. The slab is six feet wide and eight feet high to allow entry of large goods (2. Bridgegate).
1. **Passage to Moatgate This tunnel continues southwestwards some 1,000 feet, then turns due east for about 200 feet to end in a secret door. This is in the rock face of the moat just a foot above the waterline, immediately to the south of the base of the Moatgate pier. The secret door is operable as are the others here,
###### Encounters in Yggsburgh

but the trigger is to the right of the inward-swinging stone slab on the inside, and to the left on the outside. The slab is six feet wide and eight feet high to allow entry of large goods (4. Moatgate).

1. **Secret **Chamber This is a 40’ x 40’ secret chamber. This large room has a row of four 10-foot-square cells. These cages have walls of iron grating. Each cell has a narrow door with a large padlock. These are used for holding slaves en route to some destination downriver. They are empty 90% of the time. If there are prisoners in them, roll 4d4 to determine the number. Odd numbers on the die indicate that number of female slaves, while even numbers indicate that number of male slaves. The age for each is 5d8+4.

There is a table, two chairs, and two cots in the open portion of the chamber. Along the west wall are barrels and boxes with water and hard biscuits for feeding slaves when they are imprisoned here. It is easy to scale the grill of a cage and climb atop them, as they are only nine feet high, and the ceiling of the chamber is 15 feet high. In the far southeast corner of the ceiling is a concealed trap door that opens onto a passage of three-foot-width and seven- foot-height that runs some 1,500 feet south by south southeast to access the River Rat Tavern’s cellar via a secret door.

1. **Stairs** These stairs head up and to the east some 12 feet to a passage that runs generally southeast some 1,800 feet. It goes to the basement of the Beggars’ Brotherhood (Yggsburgh Encounter 51). It enters that place by a secret door. Stolen goods are moved to and from the Thieves’ Guild and the Beggars’ Brotherhood via this route.
1. **Passage **to **Rivergate This tunnel continues northwards some 500 feet to end in a secret door in the rock face, just at the edge of the Rivergate quay (or the outer plaza, as it is called). The secret door is operable as are the others here, but the trigger is to the right of the inward-swinging stone slab on the inside, and to the left on the outside. The slab is six feet wide and eight feet high to allow entry of large goods (5. Rivergate).

#### Swordsmen’s Brotherhood


**Location: Fisher Street

**Reason: When the party is seeking men, derring-do, or wants some training in weapons play

**Sign: Two men-at-arms clasping hands.

The Swordsmen’s Brotherhood is located on the west side of Fisher Street between Citadel Avenue and Wood Street. This nondescript brick building has three stories plus a loft, and has a 45-foot frontage. The first floor has a reception room in front with chairs, notice board, and desk.

The Brotherhood is neutral and will not become involved in disputes. However, it will protect members not guilty of breaking the law of the town. Hired fighters from this organization cost 6gp per level per day. Bow archers receive an additional 1gp per level. Generally speaking, fighters are from 1st-6th level and are available for such a fee. All have their own armor (no better than chain mail), and a sword or battle axe. Fighters of 7th or higher level have better armor and gain a 5% to 15% share of treasure taken while in service.

#### Lords & Gentlemen Club


**Location: North Wall Avenue

**Reason:** When the party is seeking to rise in social status, or simply become accepted by the town’s aristocracy, this is the best place to accomplish such ends

This exclusive club is located in the middle of the long block of North Wall Avenue between Guild Street (a north-south street to the east of it) and Jewel Street (a northwest-southeast street to the west of it.) The building is a large one with a 180-foot frontage. It has three stories and an attic. It is on a lot of 400 feet by 500 feet depth. Above the entrance to the club are its armorial bearings. Its escutcheon is a parted per pale gold and blue a blue sword point down and a gold coronet with seven points ending in trefoils, a chief parted purple and white above with three eight- pointed stars (estoiles), one of white, one counter-charged white and purple, and one purple. A crest of a lynx proper passant regardant, supporters of stags rampant, and a motto reading, “Loyalty to Fellowship in Honor.”

Various rooms within the club’s ground and first floors include: lounge, billiards, table gaming, library and reading, bar, dining, grand ballroom-banqueting, music, salon, small chapel, and several private parlors that can be reserved by members. The second floor has 14 two-room suites for members’ rentals, all leased out annually. The third floor also has like suites, and nine are available for short-term use. The attic story is where staff is housed. The basement is likewise for staff and servants, and there is where the kitchens and like work places are located.

Behind the club is a large, walled lawn area on which badminton, lawn bowls, and croquet are played, and at times mock combats and archery contests are held here. The back wall is a stable and barn for members’ steeds, carriages, and coaches.

When the party is seeking to rise in social status, or simply become accepted by the town’s aristocracy, this is the best place to accomplish such ends. Members are invited to important social functions, are able to make appointments with the socially elite

persons of the town, are treated with deference by less highly- placed persons (including law enforcement officials). If they become members, the characters can likely get access to town and college records and libraries, and even receive training in various fields.

Only members, guests of members, or those with written invitation from a member, are admitted inside the club. Membership is automatic if a person is recommended by the Lord Mayor, a Counselor, or a knight; otherwise it requires any three regular members in good standing to recommend a new member.

Membership in the club costs gold. There is an initiation fee of 2,500gp, plus annual dues of 2,500gp, with half that sum for the Lord Mayor, Counselors, and Knights of the Order of the Citadel. In addition, there is the payment of special assessments for club festive celebrations and charitable works, these being about 50gp per event sponsored, with four fetes and eight charitable projects per year usual. Leasing a suite costs 120gp per month additional. All food and drinks are free to members, a member paying 10gp per invited guest. Needless to say, all service is impeccable, and all food and drinks here are of the best quality.

Service staff includes a majordomo, porter, usher, chefs, cooks, baker, scullions, waiters, maids, barmen, barmaids, tailor, valets, pages, bootblacks, laundresses, janitors, gardener, groundsman, and handyman. There is a Pious Chaplain available at all times.

Governance & Members: The Lords & Gentlemen Club is governed by a board of 12 regents, the Lord Mayor the Honorary Chairman. The working head of the board is Counselor Horace Linnfield, Guild Master of the Merchants’ Guild, its Vice Chairman. Other regents include Sir Eberhardt Beemish, Secretary & Treasurer; Justicier Reginald Codorly; Sir Reynard Montjoy, KOC; Sir Anthony Belvoir KOC; Sir Bertram Trillingby; Sir Wade Fulgent; Sir Richard Albright; Sir Ulrich Hawkes; Sir Morgan Nalbord; and Harold Shepston, Guild Master of the Weavers’ Guild. There are 80 other members of the club (92 total membership), all of gentle status. Eight of them are other town officials, eight are military officers, and the other 64 are wealthy heads of gentle families and their sons.

The number of members present and active (not in a sleeping room) at any given time are listed below.

Gambling is allowed. Most of the wealthiest members of the club enjoy gambling. Although not at all historical, the Castle Keeper can assume the characters can get into games of craps, poker, and poker dice here. Minimum bet at craps is 5gp and that will bring sneers from the aristocratic young dandies at the table. Card stakes

###### Encounters in Yggsburgh

are at an ante of 2-25gp with a bet limit of 10 times the ante, and three raises only allowed. The baccarat dealer must have a bank of no less than 500gp to gain the shoe.

A character attempting to win by cheating is problematical for the Castle Keeper to manage. The odds difference for cheating can be great or small. There is always a chance a cheating player will be caught. The Castle Keeper might use one of the following systems.

1. Cheating character makes a d20 roll, adding all intelligence and dexterity modifiers. Thiefs or assassins receive an additional +1 to their die roll per level. This is the cheat roll.
1. A single Opposing Cheating roll for the non-player- character participants is compared to the cheat roll. If the latter is higher, the cheater won the game and nobody suspects. If it is a tie, or the opposing cheat roll is higher, then one non-player character is suspicious and will be watching the character. On the next cheating rolls, the one watching the character receives a +1 to their roll. If the opposing cheat roll is greater than the character’s cheat roll, then the character failed to properly cheat, and the win goes to one of the non-player characters.
1. A cheat roll of 1, regardless of bonuses, means automatic failure and all the other players are suspicious. If another cheat roll is made by the character, the opposing cheat roll will be at +1 x the number of non-player characters playing, with a minimum bonus of 3 in any case.

If only one non-player character sees and accuses a character of cheating, the latter can only deny the charge and ask for satisfaction in a duel. Being caught cheating is as good as being expelled from the club, so discourage it. A cheat permanently loses all status with the upper class and is ostracized from all social contact.

Any attempt at causing trouble or picking a fight here will result in disaster for the characters. The Castle Keeper can assume a force of fighters (including knights and guards) to be three times the number of characters involved, and with twice as many hit points collectively. If there are spell casters in the party, have more potent ones (who are club members) on hand to negate and counter the character’s castings. Do not make a fight of it, simply inform the players that their characters are swiftly subdued, bound, gagged, and removed to the city gaol with 10% of their normal hit points remaining. They will be tried on the following day for Criminal Trespassing, Disturbing the Peace, Battery, Disrespect to a Noble or Ecclesiastic, Assault, Assault with a Deadly Weapon, and possibly Endangering Property by the Careless Use of Magic. At the very least the characters will each be fined 500gp and have to pay for all damages they caused in the club (See Part I, The Culture of Yggsburgh,Crime & Punishment). Alternately, the Castle Keeper can do the battle, but much preparation would be necessary and reference to the Orders of Battle Appendix requisite. In all likelihood the result will be the same.

#### Cockerel Casino


**Location:** Southeast corner of Central and Goodman Streets **Sign:** A crowned rooster standing atop a pair of golden dice **Reason: When the party wants to rub elbows with the aristocrats

and gamble! The house wins, on average, 60% of all wagers placed against it, of course.

The Cockerel Casino is the most fashionable gambling establishment in town. Its clientele includes only aristocrats and the most wealthy of commoners. Its patrons include many young bravos as well as the more sedate sort. As is usual in places of quality, patrons are not permitted to wear armor or carry any weapon larger than a small sword. The Cockerel Casino is owned by both Georges LeClair and Loretta Holly, and is run with a large staff of personnel, including many guards in the strong room.

The casino has two floors above the ground-level one, that floor being like that of a mansion, raised above street level, so that staff and counting rooms are kept out of the patrons’ sight. The ground floor has a bar and lounge and a cashier’s room caged by bars. Inside are stairs leading down to a strong room in the basement. However, the majority of space upstairs is given over to games played at large tables, including wheel games such as wheel of fortune and roulette, dice games like craps and chuck- o-luck, and card games such as 21. The first floor consists of two public rooms in which baccarat is played, with six private rooms behind them for such high-stakes games as patrons request, the house supplying the room, dealer or other person overseeing play, serving refreshments, and taking 10% of each pot. The upper floor is the apartment of the owners.

If anyone is caught cheating, word is sent immediately to the sheriff, while the offender is given a free drink that is drugged. A constitution saving throw at -20 must be made or the character drinking falls unconscious. The offending party is then removed to a private room where the law officers take him to gaol. A trial follows the next day for Grand Theft, and is punishable by 1-5 years of bond or penal servitude. The charge will be dropped if the offender pays the casino twice the amount won by cheating and court costs of 200gp.

In cases where cheating is not attempted, gambling activity should be simulated by use of cards, dice, and other actual gambling equipment available. Otherwise, a simple roll based upon the odds of the game can be made to determine the outcome. Remember, the house has a significant advantage. The private games here are all set so as to bring 10% of what is wagered into the house coffers, this amount being taken from the pot.

A character attempting to win by cheating is problematical for the Castle Keeper to manage. The odds difference for cheating can be great or small. There is always a chance a cheating player will be caught. The Castle Keeper might use the system presented in Yggsburgh Encounter 54, Lords & Gentlemen Club.

If only one non-player character sees and accuses a character of cheating, the latter can only deny the charge and ask for satisfaction in a duel. Being caught cheating is as good as being expelled from the club, so discourage it. A cheat permanently


loses all status with the upper class and is ostracized from all social contact.

The casino uses chips, of course, so no table has any coins. The cashier has between 5,000-20,000sp and 10,000-15,000gp on hand. The strong room in the basement has 45,000-60,000gp and 25-70 cut and faceted gems of 5,000gp value each. The Castle Keeper should decide upon alarms and traps on the cashier’s cage and the basement strong room when the necessity occurs. The proprietors have a hidden strong box containing 50,000gp. Separate from this reserve is another, smaller strong box containing 100-600 cut and faceted gems of 5000gp value each. Here again, the Castle Keeper must decide what magical and mechanical traps protect the treasure against theft. The proprietors each carry from 10-60gp on them and wear 4 pieces of jewelry worth between 500-3,000gp apiece. Loretta Holly has 12 additional like pieces in the hidden, trap-locked coffer in which her spell books are kept. The contents of these books are left to the Castle Keeper to determine.

#### Dwarf Brewmeister Tavern


**Location: Trade Avenue

**Reason:** When the party wants to find demi-humans, enjoy some drinking and eating in a relaxed place…likely learning interesting rumors, and possibly running into some trouble

**Sign:** A smiling dwarf wearing a leather apron holding up a foaming tankard of ale

**Encounters:** Small Tavern Common Room, Outside the Small Tavern Events, and there is a 1 in 10 chance that the dwarf Holgar will be here drinking and wenching, and looking for trouble! (For the latter, see Yggsburgh Encounter 52, The Thieves’ Guild, Area 8.)

The Dwarf Brewmeister Tavern is located on the north side of Trade Avenue, in the middle of the block between Fisher Street and Market Avenue. This establishment is not very large, with only a 30-foot building front. The place is long though, and crowded with patrons of demi-human and human race alike, for its ale is superb and the food great. This is also a place to hear a lot of gossip from non-aristocratic persons, as its local clientele is mainly from the upper-lower and middle class. Regular visitors to Yggsburgh who have the wherewithal make a point of staying here.

There is a 20-foot-long bar to the right as one enters, with many persons standing there. A long row of booths are along the left wall, and tables run down the middle of the long room all the way to the back door and alley entrance. On weekends there will be a small band playing, usually with a singer and a dancer to add to the entertainment.

The basement is where the office, store rooms, and kitchen are located. Food is sent above by dumbwaiter and dirty dishes sent down likewise. The second and third floors have a total of 12 guest rooms. The attic houses the proprietor, the dwarf Sigtri “Tree” Stoutback, his wife Frieda Stoutback and their family. Frieda is the cook and their three children work in the kitchen and clean rooms.

Also working here are the half-elf, barmaid Tansey “Tease” Wilder, and the barmen Petrel “Pete” Neargrove (halfling), Thompli “Tom” Moles (gnome), and Walter “Bear” Whitson (human). Additionally there are 3 serving wenches, Joan (human), Sally (human), and the attractive Utile (halfling).

The staff have purses containing 1-4gp in various coin. The till at the bar has from 35gp-45gp in it. “Tree” Stoutback has a gold ring and watch worth 50gp and 600gp respectively. The family’s hidden cache 1200gp in various coin is hidden in the house. Frieda Stoutback has 5 pieces of gold jewelry set with gemstones—a pair of earrings worth 150gp, a necklace worth 700gp, a bracelet worth 450gp, a broach worth 300gp and a ring worth 250gp.

#### Green Dragon Inn


**Location: North Wall Avenue

**Sign:** On a white field an emerald green dragon armed and eyed red rampant exhaling a bolt of bright yellow lightning.

**Reason:** When the party wants a place to stay, and are seeking one where the really tough adventurers of all sorts congregate, is seeking information about crime in the town, or maybe looking for a bit of trouble...

**Encounters:** See Inn or Large Tavern Common Room, and Outside the Inn or Large Tavern Events Table

The Green Dragon Inn is located on North Wall Avenue in the triangular area northeast of Rivergate, with an industrial block to the east of it. The establishment is about the same size as the Outs Inn across the Yggsburgh Canal, south of the Moatgate. But it lacks the ambience and the greenery, not to mention a shrine and priest. Still, it is an active inn accommodating many of the rougher sorts of visitors to the town, rivermen and merchants as well as mercenary adventurers.

This inn is in a high-walled (12-foot) triangular compound, with the long side being 240 feet, the east wall 220 feet in length, and the short wall 120 feet in length. The three-story building includes a loft that is constructed so as to form the short wall. So its dimensions are 50 feet north-to-south width, 120 feet back- wall breadth, and 100 feet front-wall breadth. All windows facing outwards are barred and closed with shutters at night. The main entry gate to this walled complex is on North Wall Avenue near where it turns due east. There is a smaller back gate between the stables and storage barn that form the east wall. Finally, there is a gate accessing the alley that bisects on an east-west axis the industrial block to the east. This alley continues past a cross alley that meets Middle Thoroughfare one block further east to reach Market Avenue. This rear entrance is used by shadier clientele.

**Ground **Floor: The ground floor has an entry lounge with an inn desk and cashier, who also does money changing. A hall to the right leads to the bar room, card room, meeting room and notary office. A hall to the left leads to the dining room, private salon and guest services (valet, laundry, scribe).

**First Floor** The first floor consists of 18 larger rooms, with 14 available for rent and two used as service closets. The remaining four are used for the head staff.

**Second **Floor The second floor has 22 smaller rooms for rent and two service closets.

**Third **Floor The third floor has two eight-person dorms, and two dormitories that sleep 20 persons each.

**Loft The loft contains small rooms for the serving staff.

**Basement** The basement is where the office, store rooms and kitchen are located. Food is sent above by dumbwaiter and dirty dishes sent down likewise.

**Stables** The stables form the northern portion of the east wall. There is room for up to 48 horses in them, and the inn has 20 such animals for hire, with 12 of them being riding horses.


The rear (alley) gate is a tunnel between the stables and the barn and storage building. The barn and storage building forms the southern portion of the east wall. It can house 16 carriages or coaches, and there are four carriages (two small, two large) for hire. There are six small rooms of 10 feet by 10 feet in size and a large general storage area that is 60 feet long and 20 feet wide. There is hay and feed storage above the barn, and rooms for stables and bar staff over the barn and storage building.

Robert “Thief” Robins is the Proprietor of the Green Dragon Inn. He is well satisfied with the derring-do of past adventuring. “Thief” seldom leaves his inn to wander in search of further exploits. Some dangers come to him here, though, and he has felled many a troublesome bully or spell-caster meaning to gain a great reputation by slaying him. Bodo “Zaps” Muntz is the manager. Frederick “Rick” Braun is chief barkeep. And Norbert “Slick” Slidell is the greeter.

All four of the above individuals have their own rooms on the inn’s first floor. They are not likely to befriend any adventurers or be interested in any missions…unless they see the characters as likely marks that can be taken for a lot. Play these non-player characters as smart and hard-boiled mercenaries who assume no unnecessary risks without the likelihood of a large reward. Any division of treasure will be unequal, for they would expect at least 60% and really want it all.

The serving staff at this establishment consists of two porters, three cooks, three scullions, four food service maids, two bar maids, one janitor, nine chamber maids, one stable master, one barn master, two grooms, four stable boys and two goods handlers. One of the grooms serves as a coachman if there is an immediate demand, otherwise such a driver is hired from available out-of- work commoners.

As for asking questions, most of the patrons in the place will be hostile to strangers snooping around. However, the proprietor and his staff have no particular affection for the Thieves’ Guild, or the Assassins’ Guild for that matter. They will give information about the two for a hefty bribe. For example, if a character wants to know about the Thieves’ Guild, for 50gp or more the owner, Robert “Thief” Robins, his manager, Bodo “Zaps” Muntz, the head barman, Frederick “Rick” Braun, or Norbert “Slick” Slidell, the host, mention that the Thieves’ Guild engages in illegal slave trade and that the thieves have a secret underground passage system. For another bribe of 250gp or more such an informant will relate that there is secret entrance to the hidden subterranean passages in the plinth of the statue of the enthroned Lord Yggs (in the Lower Gardens) and another one in the Upper Gardens, although they are not sure of its location. For information see 52. The Thieves Guild and 50. The Assassin’s Guild.

#### “Ma” Watson’s Place


**Location: Moat Street

**Reason: For such times as the party needs low-cost housing,

**Sign: A bed and a tray with food on it

This building is located on Moat Street in the middle of the block immediately south of Work Close. Ethyl “Ma” Watson runs a big boarding house with 45 feet of frontage, three stories plus a loft.

She will have up to four available rooms on the second floor to let by the week, with no more than two persons (of the same sex) sharing a room and its bed. Room cost is 3gp per week for one person, or 5gp for two persons. For an additional 3gp per person, breakfast and supper will be provided.

#### River Rat Tavern


**Location: Plaza Avenue

**Reason:** When the party is seeking a low dive, in need of information on criminal activities, are itching for a fight, or have been suckered into meeting someone in this place

**Sign:** A one-eyed rat clad in riverman’s costume brandishing a cutlass

**Encounters: Small Tavern Common Room and Outside the Small Tavern Events

This tavern is located on the north side of Plaza Avenue between Fisher and Lower Market Streets. This brick building is three stories tall with a full attic. It has a 60-foot frontage, the eastern half being the River Rat Tavern, the western half being Yeerouf’s Loan Bank (see Yggsburgh Encounter 74 Yeerouf’s Loan Bank). The owner of the tavern owns the entire building, so the basement and upper floors are tavern-related. The basement has store rooms and a secret apartment for those seeking refuge from the law. In this hidden suite of rooms is located a secret trapdoor entrance to the Thieves’ Underground tunnels (see Yggsburgh Encounter 52, The Thieves’ Guild).

The first floor of the building has 16 private rooms. The second has four private rooms and four large dormitory rooms with 10 beds in each. The attic is the lodgings of the proprietor and his chief cronies.

The ground-floor portion of the building occupied by the tavern has a 60-foot-long by 27-foot-wide common room, with a 20-foot- long (stand up) bar and numerous large and small tables—the smaller ones against the wall and in the back are those favored by the regulars here. Behind the common room is an open staircase to the floor above, with a passage beside it leading to two water closets on one side, two small private rooms on the other, and the kitchen at the corridor’s end.

###### Goods and Services	Cost



Liquor	15cp per glass

Buttermilk	1sp per pint



Dinner	8sp

Supper	5sp



The help in the tavern consists of two cooks, two scullions, four serving wenches, two potboys, and four cleaning maids for the rooms above. As this is a rough place, the Castle Keeper may consider them more capable fighters should it be desired. The stats, in the latter case, are listed below. The owner and his cronies consist of some capable fighters and ne’er-do-wells, as described below.


Robert “Big Bob” Hogan is the owner of this place and the boss. He is a tall and ruggedly handsome man of age 35 with black hair, blue eyes, and a florid complexion. Big Bob is pleasure-loving, suspicious, irascible, and covetous.

Melanie “Melons” Hogan is the hostess who is Big Bob’s sister, the brains of his operation, and a member of the Thieves’ Guild. She is tall, shapely, and good looking in her late 20s, with the same black hair and blue eyes as her older brother, but with milk white skin. “Melons” is a flirt and a user—venal, greedy, and ruthless.

Melvin “Boats” Orr is the chief barman and oftentimes river pirate. Boats is around 40, a muscular and husky man of average height, grizzled hair worn in a short queue, ugly from both a scar on his cheek that makes a corner of his mouth droop and much exposure to the elements. He is enamored of Melanie and takes offense at anyone overly familiar with her, and she loves to see him beat up someone over her. “Boats” is not very bright, but he is cunning and quite without scruples.

Phillip “Father” Brooks, a boon companion of “Big Bob” and “Boats,” is the shill for marks of all sorts (gambling or swindles) entering the tavern. He is freelance and survives because of his association with Hogan and his sister. “Father” typically wears friar’s garments. His rather plain and open face being wide-eyed and rounded, he appears mild and benign, his sparkling brown eyes convey a false friendliness, so he is a seemingly trusting fellow rather out of place in such surroundings. Brooks is hard-hearted, remorseless, and conniving.

###### Encounters in Yggsburgh



There is a gang of cutthroat bullies who hang out at this tavern. This bunch is currently being paid by the Marquis Talworth, through the Stable Master, Jason Barger at the Outs Inn (see Yggsburgh Encounter 80. The Outs Inn), to make trouble in Yggsburgh by inciting street riots, committing robbery, burglary, murder, and mayhem. Of course, the gang likes being paid extra for what it does for enjoyment. There will be 1-2 leaders and main members of the gang, and 2-5 of the lesser bullies at the tavern at any given time a character or party is there.

The other patrons (6-36) are a mix of rough laborers and rivermen, various common women and doxies, and on occasion a party of 3- 6 young blades out slumming. As all such aristocratic bravos have training in fencing, assume the following stats for each:

There is a 1 in 10 chance that the dwarf Holgar will be here drinking and wenching (see Yggsburgh Encounter 52. The Thieves’ Guild, Area 8).

Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

#### Citadel Square


**Location: West end of the town

**Reason: When out shopping, sightseeing, or just passing through on their way to somewhere else. A lot can happen here, including meeting important aristocrats.

**Encounters: Town Square Events

Citadel Square is located at the west end of Yggsburgh. In the daytime, its fringes are populated with vendors’ booths, while peddlers with better small items roam about. Upper class citizens and some college students stroll about the place to shop and be seen. It is usual for there to be up to a score of performers here seeking free-will payment from those who watch their acts, which include musical performances, singing, juggling, sword- swallowing, fire-breathing, tumbling and acrobatics, story-telling, sleight of hand legerdemain, and occasionally performing animals, such as dogs or a bear.

At the center of Citadel Square is a large monument. It is a white marble plinth upon which stands a bronze statue. The statue is of a knight arrayed in old fashioned armor of chain mail, bearing a shield upon which there is a dragon rampant. He is mounted on a rearing destrier with sword raised on high as if to rally his followers against foes. On the front of the marble base is a bronze plaque with the following words:

_In _memory _of _Sir _Reillomark, _who _fell _nobly _in _battle against the enemy besieging us. May he always be revered for his bravery and leadership._

_Lord _Yggs, _on _the _fifth _year _after _the _founding _of _this free town._

Any fighter who salutes the statue gains a benison. This is a one- time-only bonus of +1 to an attack roll if the fighter calls on Sir Reillomark to aid his arm in striking the enemy.

At mid-forenoon (10 AM) and mid-afternoon (2 PM) units of the guard parade here. The mounted troops on duty form up outside the Citadel Gate and ride around the square. Two 30-man platoons of halberdiers and two of crossbowmen march out of the gate and perform drill evolutions in the central portions of the square for one hour’s time as many citizens watch. On holidays mock combats and archery matches are performed here.

Only officially-licensed beggars are allowed here. There are no more than 12 at any time and they are limited to begging in the morning or afternoon. Those who infract against the rules are subject to having their license revoked. Unlicensed beggars are sent to the pillory before the City Gaol (see Yggsburgh Encounter 10. The City Gaol) for four hours, or a full 24 hours for repeat offenders.

There are two large notice boards in the middle of the north and south edges of this plaza, and here the various proclamations of the Lord Mayor and lesser authorities are posted. When there is some very important message being put up, two deputy bailiffs will act as criers to call the attention of all persons to the notice.


#### Market Plaza


**Location: As shown

**Reason:** Whether out shopping, sightseeing, or just passing through on their way to somewhere else, a lot can happen here, especially at night when assassins are stalking their victims

**Encounters: Town Square Events

During the hours that the gates are open there are dozens of vendors’ stalls and carts set up for business here, while a score or more of peddlers carrying trays of their merchandise cry out for business. Added to these sellers will be a like swarm of beggars (there being no restrictions on begging here), a handful of those soliciting sex, while several performers seek free-will payment from those who watch their acts. Acts include musical performances, singing, juggling, sword-swallowing, fire-breathing, tumbling and acrobatics, story-telling, sleight of hand legerdemain, and occasionally performing animals, such as dogs or a bear. Many citizens and visitors alike are found shopping and watching the various entertainments here.

There is a large notice board in the very center of this plaza, and here the various proclamations of the Lord Mayor and lesser authorities are posted. When there is some very important message being put up a deputy bailiff, he acts as crier to call the attention of all persons to the notice.

The entertainment areas in the blocks north and south of the Market Plaza that sell food and drink begin opening at dawn, but most of the others do not begin operation until noon or later. The latter remain open until well after midnight, some until dawn.

After dark many booths remain active, using lanterns and torches to attract customers. So too do peddlers and performers, while beggars and those soliciting for money in other ways use the ambient light and their voices to be noticed by the many people in the place.

#### Elite Arms & Armor


**Location: Grand Avenue and Central Street

**Reason:** When the party is seeking to buy or sell armor and/or weapons

**Sign: A shield depicting an armored and armed man with a shield, standing at the ready

This building is located on the southwest corner of Grand Avenue and Central Street (located on a triangular half-block). The ground floor windows have the name of the establishment painted discretely at the top, displaying armor, shields, and various weapons behind them. Elite Arms & Armor is in a building of flat- iron shape, with its largest dimension being 60 feet along Grand Avenue. Its Central Street side is only about 45 feet long, and the “point” of the structure is an arc that is 10 feet at its base. The building has basement, main, first, second, and attic floors. Armor and arms are crafted and repaired in the basement. Armor is displayed on the ground floor, weapons on the first floor, while the proprietor and key staff have quarters above that.

###### Encounters in Yggsburgh

When the party is seeking to buy or sell armor and/or weapons they should come here. This assumes the Castle Keeper will want to allow “one-stop” shopping. If this is not the case, then have some of the armor and weapons available only from the following different type of shops: armorer, bowyer, cutler (daggers and knives), fletcher, leather shop, sword smith, and weapons shop.

Archibald Dillingham is the proprietor of this establishment. Goodman Dillingham is around 60 years of age. He is now a wealthy, upper middle class businessman and a well-respected citizen who expects to be granted gentle status soon for his purveying of excellent arms and armor to the aristocracy.

#### Fanrael’s Occult Shop


**Location: Wood Street

**Reason: When the party is seeking to buy or sell spell component materials

**Sign: A scroll upon which lie various herbs, stones, and bones

This building is located on the south side of Wood Street, in the middle of the block between Black Tower Lane to the east and Friars Lane to the west. The ground floor windows have the name of the establishment painted discretely at the top, and display a few open boxes and jars of common spell components. This shop has 25 feet of frontage, the building equipped with basement storage, compounding, and experiment area. The ground floor is occupied by the shop, back room archive of odd and rare components, and office filled with grimoires and magical treatises.

The person who will greet customers is Ilmond Fanrael, the owner. His and his family’s rooms are located on the first floor and in the attic story above it. Goodman Fanrael is Ilmond’s wife. They have one son and two daughters.

Prices for spell components for a single spell are, on average, 10gp per spell per level. But prices range depending on whether or not the spell requires exotic components. Common spell components can cost as little as 1gp per spell per level, and go as high as 500gp per level per spell. The Castle Keeper should use their best judgment in these matters.

If the characters are selling items, they will fetch from 1-5gp, multiplied by the spell level, as a base for common items. Uncommon items double the base rate, rare items triple it, and very rare items are bought at five times the base rate. These exotic items include the likes of monster parts (teeth, claws, eyes, hair, hide, scales, etc.) and liquids (blood, poison, secretions, etc.) but the Castle Keeper should use their best judgment in deciding these issues.

eastern portion of the building. He is not given to engaging in hand-to-hand combat, but summons his genie to fight for him.

Master Waldo Junker is aged and rather eccentric. He wears a gown of jade green silk, with an indigo wizard’s robe over it, held in place by a blue silk sash patterned with silver flying cranes and gold tortoises. On his feet are curly-toed shoes of motley yellow and red leather, and on his bald head a cap of purple velvet embroidered with runes of many hues that seem to be moving slowly over the cloth. Waldo’s skin is the color of a fallen oak leaf, leathery and creased. His hands are large but thin, and his long

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

fingers are tipped with rather long and horn-like nails. He has a wispy beard similar to that of an old mandarin, and his eyebrows rise in bushy wings above bright green eyes. His luxuriant eyebrows seem to be attempting to move up his domed forehead to take the place of his lost head of hair. He moves with feline grace despite his years, and his voice is soft but strong, like that of a young man. His typical greeting is: “What brings you to my worthless little shop, O Esteemed One?”

The Castle Keeper must manage all the selling and trade that takes place here. Junker sells and buys strange and curious objects of old and/or exotic sort that are not found elsewhere. These include weird pictures and figurines, strangely bound books, curios, small boxes with complex locks, stones with carvings upon them, insects trapped in amber, shrunken heads, mummified bats, small mechanical items, etc. He will pay from 5sp to 50gp or more, as the Castle Keeper decides, based on the item proffered for sale.

When asked about magical items, he responds: “A few I have kept safely away. They are not for sale, but I will trade them for like items that have more appeal to me. What do you wish, and what will you offer in trade?” Of course any trade here will be one in which the character concerned must give over more to obtain less in total value. For instance, Master Junker will trade a +3 longsword in return for a +2 bastard sword, or a +3 short sword for a +2 dagger. Again, the Castle Keeper must use his ingenuity in all such bargaining. Several potions and scrolls do not equal any substantial magical object, but a potent wand and ring might. Remember, Waldo Junker is shrewd and will always try to profit from any trade, asking initially at least three times the worth of what he is willing to trade from his cache of dweomered things. He is never fooled by fakes or cursed items. He does not identify unknown magic items, but he will offer to accept a valuable one in trade for something of minor value—a magical draught, a scroll of spells, or some like item.

It goes without saying that this shop does not have every imaginable enchanted object. Which ones he does possess is up to the Castle Keeper. Where a desired item is too potent, have Waldo offer something useful, but less powerful, in trade for the collectively more valuable magical object the character has offered. Wishing objects can never be had from this shop.

The ground and upper floors are each half-occupied by the business, each shop having a rear office, storage room and back entrance. The outer door leads to an interior staircase going up to the second story, where the proprietor of the religious items store lives with his family of six. The entire first floor is the lodging of Waldo Junker. He has two vicious guard dogs as pets. Here he has a locked strong room with magical and mechanical traps, and in it are stored all enchanted items not otherwise kept on his person.

The basement is accessed only from inside Junker’s shop, through a trapdoor in the back opening onto stairs. This is the place Waldo stores all of his excess inventory of curios and some larger items, such as a dozen bizarre statues and several very unusual golems. He is not averse to trading a golem for some more potent magical item, of course.


It is not contemplated that successful looting of this place can occur, but should some foolhardy character attempt it, the Castle Keeper must devise the most devious and deadly of traps and dweomers about the establishment which must be navigated. If attacked and hard pressed, Waldo Junker does not engage in hand to hand combat, but summons a genie to fight for him and teleports away as many hostile creatures from his shop as possible. He sends them 12,000 miles distant, but leaving all they wear and carry behind.

The shop and workrooms occupy the ground floor and the basement. Yeoman Clothyard and his family occupy the first floor. The second floor and attic are rented out, respectively, to the bowyer who works for Clothyard, and a family of lower class folk.

Yeoman Dart Clothyard is the owner and chief fletcher. Clothyard does not adventure, as he has a wife and five children to care for. His two older sons are apprentices of his, both making bolts of good quality now. Clothyard is aided by Floyd Archer, a bowyer who also has no interest in adventuring.

#### Gnigul Butterbotham’s Courier and Travel Service


**Location: Market Plaza

**Reason:** When the party needs to get or send something in a hurry, or they themselves need to travel fast and far without horses

**Sign: A winged boat

This establishment is located on the west side of Market Plaza, between Central Street’s dogleg on the north and Offmarket Lane on the south. The building this business is located in has a 30-foot frontage.

This plain two-story building is occupied by a colorful and loquacious gnome businessman with an unusual magical item. Unless it’s one of the days Gnigul Butterbotham makes his regular Dunfalcon journey, there is a 50% chance Gnigul and Bork Craigs will be in the residence; otherwise a thin but rather comely halfling woman named Samantha Pangia will be there to serve customers.

The front of the ground floor is the office, and the rear houses Master Butterbotham’s magical flying boat, the Swift Flying Skiff . He is careful not to allow anyone to see the craft in its miniaturized enchanted form (detailed hereafter). The basement is let out to a group of five gnomes. The first floor is given over to the lodgings of the owner, his bodyguard and assistant, while the attic is tenanted by a human family of six.

Gnigul Butterbotham is a mischievous former thief who once plied his trade in a distant kingdom. However, some unfortunate mishaps made him rethink his life of adventuring, and the acquisition of a potent magic item has allowed him to “go legit,” so he now runs a travel and postal service.

He has a single bodyguard, Bork Craigs, a magically-changed

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

dwarf who has been permanently enlarged, so he is about 8’ tall and 4’ wide. Bork Craigs is stoic and rarely speaks, usually speaking only in dwarven to Gnigul. Bork is a loyal henchman to Gnigul. For dangerous assignments or valuable materials, Gnigul might hire 1-4 archers for aid.

Gnigul Butterbotham doesn’t adventure anymore, nor will he or Bork Craigs serve in this capacity other than to transport and defend his boat and passengers.

He has two regular weekly scheduled trips from the Yggsburgh area. He makes a few stops at important locations, then treks off to Dunfalcon, meeting up with his “shopper,” one Elaine Hooper and his notary contact, a human named Unst Ruchbaker. Outside of this, he is open for special deliveries and travel services. In the Yggsburgh area, aristocrats and wealthy gentry tend to hire his services frequently.

Gnigul offers customers the services described below. He charges a fair price for this extremely convenient service, although he also sometimes does charity work for the peasant classes who live in the area, along with some favors for the gnomes in the vicinity.

Gnigul doesn’t ask many questions, although activities that carry a severe legal penalty and/or conflict with his personal morality he may refuse—for instance, no slave trading. He does not travel at night, so any trips must be done within sunup to sundown. Thus, if he’s hired for a “day trip,” the farthest he will go is about 300 miles. He does not offer himself for long-term excursions.

**Courier: Delivery of important documents or goods, such as legal notices, contracts, letters or writs, etc., to a specified location. Cost is 3gp per letter, document, or small parcel carried on a regularly scheduled trip; otherwise, and for large packages, the same as transportation for a passenger (below). There is a 5cp per item per mile additional charge, and a minimum charge of 5gp for short trips.

**Courier **Purchases: This is for special or hard-to-find goods, spell components, or delicacies found only in Dunfalcon and delivered to a specified location. Cost is 5cp per mile traveled to a maximum of 5gp, plus 10% of the cost of items purchased.

**Transportation: Up to 10 human-sized passengers, carrying baggage of up to 60 pounds per passenger. The cost is 5cp per person per mile, with a minimum charge of 3gp per person for short trips.

It is not contemplated that the Castle Keeper will allow any attack, burglary or robbery of Gnigul Butterbotham. If this is allowed though, set the amount gained on a base liquid wealth of 1,000- 2,000gp and include the magic items noted in the possession of the gnome and his bodyguard.

Gnigul Butterbotham _(He _is _a _chaotic _good, _guome, _6th _/ _4th_ _leeel illusiouist/thief whose eital stats are: HP 37, AC 17. His_ _prime attributes are: dex, iut. His siguificaut attribute is: dex 17._ _His secoudary skill is: busiuess. He carries a +4 riug of protectiou,_ _crossbow _aud _short _sword.)_


Bork Craigs _(He _is _a lawful good, _dwarf, 8th _leeel fighter _whose eital _stats _are: _HP _60, _AC _15. _His _prime _attributes _are: _str, _dex._ _He carries chaiumail, +2 battle axe, crossbow, +2 bolts, four +3_ _bolts _of _dragou _slayiug _aud _dagger.)_

#### Kenneth’s Tonsorial Salon


**Location: Goodman Street

**Reason:** When the party is seeking proper grooming—clean and cut hair, and a shave. This is the place where the better class of townsfolk go for the grooming

**Sign: Crossed straight razor and scissors

The Tonsorial Salon is located on Goodman Street on the north side of the block between Crossgates Avenue and Guild Street. This building has a 30-foot frontage and is a three-story building with a loft. All the upper floors are rented out, but the loft is available for the characters should they care to rent a place in town. The loft is 27 feet wide, 87 feet long, and has six rooms— front room, four bed chambers, and a large kitchen. The rental cost is only 30gp per month, as it is a walk-up.

When being barbered here (by Al, Bruce, Buster, Ken, or Percy) there will be 5-8 other patrons and at least one of them will be an important person. Roll a d20 and refer to the table below to determine the identity of important person(s) being attended to.

#### Mercantile Bank


**Location: Crossgates Avenue and Goodman Street

**Reason: When the party wishes to change money, place valuables in safe keeping, establish a bank account, and/or obtain a letter of credit

**Sign: Only a large bronze plaque bearing the bank’s name

The Mercantile Bank is located on the northwest corner of Crossgates Avenue and Goodman Street. This two-story building has a frontage of 45 feet. The architecture is similar to that of a Roman temple, with four large stone columns supporting a roof pediment. The ground floor has a front lobby for customers, an open stairway leading to the bank’s executive offices and meeting rooms above, bars and tellers’ cages dividing the front two-thirds from the rear where the records and cashier’s office are located, as well as the staircase to the basement. The upper floor is where the owner and main officers of the bank have their offices. There are, as well, one small and one large conference room here. The basement has a large vault surrounding a strong room, a lock-box room, counting area, and a staff lounge.

The characters, entering here for the first time, note an array of life-like statues of people that look incongruous in such a place of high finance. The figures appear to be of criminal sort, both thieves and armed robbers posed in life-like action. There is a bronze plaque on a chain around each statue’s neck. An examination discovers that each bears the name of a person, their criminal record, and a statement as to the date the offender attempted to burglarize or rob the bank. This array of petrified would-be thieves is very reassuring to the bank’s honest customers, and a thorn in the side of the Thieves’ Guild (see Yggsburgh Encounter 52.)

The owner of the bank is none other than the Right Honorable Treasurer Counselor of Yggsburgh, Oswald Striker (see Yggsburgh Encounter 32. Residence, Oswald Striker).

Employed here are Henry Thaller, the bank manager and a pompous and officious man; George Talley, the accountant- comptroller, a thin and nervous man; Maximilian Bigby, the chief cashier, a large and hearty fellow; Thomas Hatcher, a teller, a quiet, no-nonsense little chap; and William Brown, another teller, a friendly and outgoing type. Additionally there are another cashier, two secretaries, two clerks, and a maintenance man-janitor.

No armed robbery is contemplated for this location. The Castle Keeper is to assume that all manner of magical detection and protection devices have been installed in this place, from the detection and revealing of ethereal and invisible intruders to the paralysis or petrifaction of anyone attempting robbery or theft, with results as noted above.

**Letter **of **Credit: There is a 5% fee of the sum of cash the

###### Encounters in Yggsburgh

letter is drawn for. A letter of credit is issued only for sums of 5,000gp or more. It is a negotiable bearer instrument that can be brought to most other banks to draw down cash against the amount shown on the letter of credit. The individual having one deposits a sum of money with the issuing bank. For example, 50,000gp the issuing bank then gives the individual a letter of credit for 47,500gp. The bearer can easily carry this and, when in need of cash, counter-sign and draw down some or all of the money noted as his in the letter. The bank paying out money against the instrument charges a fee of 2.5% of the sum drawn from them, and if it is not all of the money shown as being in the bearer’s credit, issue a new letter of credit from their bank. The exchanging bank will then bill the issuing bank for a sum equal to the letter of credit plus 2.5%. It is relatively expensive for the bearer, but a most convenient way to transport large sums of money from place to place.

**Loan** This is for an 8%-15% annual interest fee for amounts from 50-50,000gp or more. As in real life, loans are not obtained easily without security for the amount. The bank will loan no more than 50% of the actual value of the security given over, that based on the owner’s equity in the security. For example, a property worth 50,000gp, for which the title deed holder still owed 20,000gp, would have an equity of 30,000gp; a loan of 30,000gp against that equity would be questionable, so most banks would allow no more than 15,000gp. On the other hand, a valuable magic item given over to the bank is considered as 100% owner equity, so 50% of its cash sale value will be loaned.

#### Yeerouf’s Loan Bank


**Location:** North side of Citadel Avenue, between Fisher and Lower Market Streets

**Reason:** When the party wants to hock something for cash, including what is too hot to sell normally, this is the place. They can also buy hard-to find items here, such as brass knuckles, old musical instruments, and jewelry at wholesale prices (caveat emptor)

**Sign: A pile of gold coins beneath three connected gold balls—the latter being the near-universal sign of a pawn broker

This is a brick building with a 60-foot frontage. The western half of the building comprises Yeerouf’s Loan Bank, the eastern half being the River Rat Tavern (see Yggsburgh Encounter 59. The River Rat Tavern).

The shop’s proprietor, one Dalbid Yeerouf, is a deadly enemy of The Striped Mage, and he will be ingenuous whenever any conversation arises that involves that wizard. If the characters are in the least antagonistic towards his foe, Dalbid Yeerouf encourages their antipathy and does his utmost to inflame their passions against him, including giving them slightly better deals than normal. If the characters mention attacking the Striped Mage, this man willingly offers suggestions as to how this can be done successfully, but under no circumstances will he join in such an attack.

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

Yeerouf wears a black robe of exotic cut, covered with hieroglyphs embroidered in silver thread. He appears to be around 35 years old but is, in fact, far older. He has been magically rejuvenated in his past. He is a tall and thin fellow with sharp features, a beaked nose and olive complexion. His eyes are deep-set, so he has a rather sinister appearance, that suiting his nature, of course.

If a lone individual comes to his shop with a highly valuable object he paralyzes the victim, steals all their goods, carries the helpless individual to the cellar (where he has a locked cell), binds and then sells him or her when slavers from downriver call. This is a once a week occurrance.

This place has many magical alarms, guards, and warding devices, so no robbery or looting is anticipated. However, if the characters discover his malign nature, and defeat him in combat, then the Castle Keeper can assign as many as six magic items, in addition to any of Yeerouf’s that survive the fight, as loot to be taken. There should be between 20,000-80,000gp in coin, gems, jewelry, and other small valuables here. He also has several spell books, which the Castle Keeper should flesh out, bearing the following advice in mind: the Castle Keeper should supply this malign fellow with whatever other magical things he might need to make his defeat by the characters most difficult. But, in all such cases, remember that if he is overcome, the characters will gain the benefit of such things if they are multi-use, so keep those kinds of things to a minimum.

#### Regal Chair & Guard Service


**Location: Crossgates Avenue

**Reason: This is the place where adventurers can go to hire sedan chairs, linkboys, and/or armed escorts

**Sign: A haughty looking man in finery seated in a chair borne by four carriers

This business is located on the west side of Crossgates Avenue opposite the Bridgegate plaza area. This building has a front of 45 feet, two upper stories and an attic. The shop and open chair “garage” occupy the ground floor.

Goodman Wong and his family occupy the first floor. The second floor and attic are rented out to lower class folk, while the basement has two families of gnomes living in it.

Charles Wong is the owner and manager. He does not hire himself out nor adventure, as he has a prosperous and relatively safe business enterprise that supports him, a wife and three children, and a mistress.

There are 8 chair carriers, 4 guards, and 4 linkboys employed here. Service closes at 2pm. Several freelance chairmen rent chairs from Wong, work from the Moatgate and Rivergate, and charge the same rates for their services as Wong does (and their chairs have his company name on them as well). They do not have linkboys or armed guards, so they operate only during daylight hours and quit when the gates are shut for the night.

#### Madam Cargal’s Gallery


**Location:** The east corner of Citadel Square, where West Way and Citadel Avenue meet

**Reason:** When the party wants to sell objects d’art, antiques or rarities

**Sign: A bronze plague bearing the gallery’s name

The gallery is located on the corner of Citadel Square, where West Way and Citadel Avenue meet. This four-story stone building is very fancy, with a marble facade and ornately carved masonry. The entry is flanked by caryatid columns. The main entry is on Westend Way, for the building is triangular; its western end only 15 feet across, its north side frontage 90 feet, and its northwest to southeast side about 120 feet long.

Should the characters want to sell objects d’art, antiques or rarities, this is the main place to dispose of such things. Transactions can be made at 30%-60% market value of the item sold, depending on the likelihood of a quick sale to another buyer.

**Basement** The basement contains storage and work rooms, with two bedrooms and a kitchen for the restorer and appraiser in the employ of this business.

**Ground Floor** The ground floor has a large gallery showroom, with a broad open staircase leading to the first floor and two smaller rooms, the office and a private showroom. Various antique carpets, tapestries, paintings, statues, furniture, and art objects are on display here, most of them large.

**First Floor** The first floor has three separate rooms displaying smaller items: china, glass, pottery, small furniture, handcrafted rare objects, and metal items of silver, bronze, copper and pewter.

**Second Floor** The second floor has a locked door and access is granted only by appointment. It contains objects of the rarest sort; museum pieces, ancient coins, goldware, ivory, jewelry, etc.

###### Encounters in Yggsburgh

**Third Floor** The third floor contains the apartment of Madam Cargal, a gentlewoman from a financially-strapped family, who has made it very well. Her personal staff live here as well. Although Madam Cargal is not given to combat, her two assistants, Gloria Dell and Howard Astenby, are.

Besides being able in many areas, Gloria is a knowledgeable salesperson who loves the business, the objects in the showrooms, and Madam Cargal too. Howard, the nephew of Madam Cargal, is also a fine salesman, a lover of antiques and rarities, fine things, and of Gloria, with whom he is quite enamored. Howard is a member of the Lords & Gentlemen Club (see Yggsburgh Encounter 54.), partly because Madam Cargal wants him to be there to enhance her trade, partly because Howard wants to be important, a member of society. Lately he has been losing rather heavily at the gaming tables there…

###### Rivers Shrine of (Castle Keeper insert deity name)


**Location: The southwest corner of Inside Street and Burr Lane.

**Sign:** The Castle Keeper may, at their option, have the sacred symbol of the deity herein honored displayed in various places—on the roof, above the door, on the wall beside it, etc.

The Castle Keeper should insert an appropriate river deity name in the title.

This stone building is plain, a tall rectangle of 30-foot width and 60-foot depth. Its open interior has two rows of pillars supporting the roof, with the altar and votive shrine at the west end of the structure. There are four benches in the front for worshippers unable to stand for a service, but otherwise the space is open and the faithful stand for the ceremonies conducted here. No more than 250 persons can be accommodated, but the usual attendance is around 150, save when the Priest there officiating is the Devout Ragly (see Yggsburgh Encounter 80. The Outs Inn, Chapel).

There is a 50-foot long, 20-foot deep wooden lean-to on the south side of the building. There are cooking facilities there, including a large fireplace on the east wall. The majority of the space in the shed is taken up by long, narrow tables and benches. Local residents volunteer to cook and serve two free meals a day to as many as 200 poor folks. The morning meal is usually hot broth of some kind and bread, while supper is soup (often fish chowder) and bread. On holy feast days there will be cooked fish and lentils added to the breakfast, and in the evening the usual plus slices of

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

roast meat or meat pie servings, along with some cheese and fruit for dessert.

The usual Priest serving here is the Pious Thorstead, a big man of some 30 years who is as honest and devout as his superior ecclesiastic, Ragly. Like him, Thorstead is there to help others in matters of faith in his deity, and to see to their mental and physical well-being too. While there is an alms box, and collections are taken during services, most of the faithful are poor and have little in the way of money. They assist by contributing old clothing and items, and helping prepare the morning and evening free meals that Thorstead provides for believers in the lean-to on the south side of the shrine.

Thorstead will assist character’s with all manner of spells, but he expects that in return those with the wherewithal will be generous in their contributions to the shrine and its work with the poor and needy. Persons who accept his deity as their principal one are expected to contribute at least 100gp per level of spell he used to assist them. Those of other faith are expected to voluntarily give at least twice that for such services.

Pious Thorstead _(He _is _a _[somethiug] _good, _humau, _7th _leeel_ _cleric _whose _eital _stats _are _HP _35, _AC _11 _(AC _18, _wheu _armed_ _aud _battle _ready). _His _secoudary _skill _is: _leadership. _He _geuerally prepares curiug aud healiug spells wheu iu his shriue.)_

It also offer ashtrays, incense, incense burners, smoking jackets and smoking stands.

#### Boatman Tavern


**Location: East Road at the southwest corner of Nearmoat Lane

**Reason: When the characters are looking for some relaxation and information about river travel or traffic

**Sign:** A riverman in a rowboat

**Encounters:** Inn or Large Tavern Common Room, and Outside the Inn or Large Tavern Events

This is a big, rambling timber and plaster building on a fieldstone foundation, in a style akin to that of the Tudor. Its main portion has two stories plus a gabled attic. A one-story-with-loft wing to the east, that is 50 feet long and 30 feet wide, is where the main


public room is located. In it is the bar, and tables for drinking and eating of casual fare. In the main building, a place of some 45-foot width and 80-foot length, are the formal dining room, kitchen, tavern office, a reception room, and lounge for overnight guests. The proprietor and his family occupy the remainder of the ground floor. The floor above has four two-room suites and six single ones. The second floor has 10 single rooms and a 16-bed dormitory room. Some of the tavern’s staff are lodged in the attic.

This place hosts many of the local rivermen and longshoremen, who come in to drink and eat. Many passing bargers, boatmen and sailors stopping at Yggsburgh also come here. There are land travelers staying here too, especially if the Outs Inn is filled. The patrons are a mix of honest folk and criminals, for many swindlers, sharpers, highwaymen, and river pirates find the Boatman Tavern to their liking. One can come and go easily by road or canal, or disappear into the maze of The Outs’ buildings.

Edgar “Big Ed” Bass is the owner and proprietor. He is over six feet tall, stout, and his dark brown hair is graying at the temples. He dresses in common garb, mostly brown leather, even though he can easily afford finery. He has a homely face with bright hazel eyes that convey affability and a congeniality. Beneath that façade, though, he is tough and alert, ready for trouble and unafraid of its coming. He is busy with tavern guests much of the time, or else having a pint and playing cards or darts, as he is content to have his brother-in-law see to much of the business here.

Gilbert “Gaff” Hooker is Edgar Bass’ brother-in-law and bar manager. Gaff Hooker reminds one of a ferret as he is of above average height, lean, sharp faced, and moves quickly. He usually wears riverman’s blue canvas knee britches with buckskin leather armor of doublet style. He is well-organized, observant, and constantly watching to see that the tavern makes a good profit, for Gaff gets 10% of that sum. Added to the small skim he takes—after all, the place belongs to his wife’s brother—he makes an ample living for himself, his wife, and their two children, with some left over for spending on a doxy.

William “Beau Bill” Carter is the head bartender. At age 35, Beau Bill Carter appears 10 years younger. A handsome and muscular man with long hair of sandy blonde and rakish beard and moustache, he appeals to the ladies and is accepted as a roguish fellow by laborers and outlaws alike. He tells great stories, listens well, and loves a good joke. Thus he is a very popular barkeep who is bought many drinks, and who is free to return the favor with a drink “on the house.” Beau Bill was a soldier at age 15, but retired from that vocation about five years ago for the more exciting life he now has.

Edgar “Young Ed” Bass is the owner’s eldest son and bouncer. Young Ed Bass is a chip off the old block, but he is taller and better looking than his father. While he is wild and loves to carouse and gamble, Young Ed is firmly grounded in common sense and lucky in the bargain. He assists where needed, but he is mainly in the common room assisting Gaff Hooker at the bar and watching for trouble-makers. He suspects that his uncle Gaff is filching a little money, but the tavern is so profitable that he isn’t much worried about that. What he doesn’t like is Gaff’s skirt chasing, for he is very fond of his Aunt Jane and her children.

Mabel “Midge” Fairhill is the head serving wench. Midge is in her early 20s, small and finely built, yet shapely. She has perfect skin, doll-like features, ice-blue eyes and a mop of curly blonde hair. She is vivacious and charming—whether she is speaking coarsely with roughnecks or pretending most ably to be refined when waiting on gentry. She is cold and selfish, and although she earns a good living, Midge wants far more. She dreams of luxury and would gladly be the doxy of a wealthy man, but she will settle for Gaff Hooker’s presents for now, hoping that he will divorce his wife and marry her, for she knows Gaff could steal a lot more from the tavern. Midge is flexible, though, and she will be ready to move on to more golden opportunities when they present themselves…wealthy adventurers, for example.

There are over a dozen other persons working at the tavern. Alice Bass, Big Ed’s wife, oversees the kitchen help. Alison Bass, Big Ed’s eldest child, is in charge of the dining room. Roberta Bass, Big Ed’s teenage daughter, serves tables in the common and dining rooms. Jane Hooker, Big Ed’s sister and wife of Gilbert “Gaff”

#### The Outs Inn


**Location: East Road and Nemo Street

**Reason: Need you ask?

**Sign:** A jolly innkeeper opening a door for a burgher waiting outside

**Encounters:** Outs Inn Random Encounters (Appendix C, Urban Enconters, The Outs Inn)

The Outs Inn is located on the southeast corner of East Road and Nemo Street. It is a very large, low-walled inn of highest quality. Its customers are usually well-to-do travelers, whether coming to the area by water or land. Most patrons are coach borne, traveling between points eastwards and the city of Dunfalcon. Those regular visitors coming to Yggsburgh on business that are able to afford the rates generally stay at the Outs Inn, for it is clean, very comfortable, has all the amenities and the food is excellent. Thus there are a number of chair carriers and small carriages always near the main entrance in daylight hours, their operators ready to convey inn patrons to the nearby town.

The proprietor’s great grandparents purchased the place, then a mere tavern, over 80 years ago. By investing all of their money and considerable labor, they made the new inn a most successful enterprise. Over the intervening years the Outs Inn has been expanded and made more lavish, so that it is now a famous landmark.

The buildings comprising the Outs Inn form a rectangular compound that is 450 feet long east-west, and 300 feet deep north-south. The whole is set back from the road and street 20 feet. Separate buildings are connected by 12-foot high fieldstone walls set with curved iron spikes.

The main entrance is a double gate on East Road that is 30 feet from the corner wall paralleling Nemo Street. There is a single gate for tradesmen and freight on Nemo Street, 50 feet from the southern end of the wall there. There are 25 fruit-bearing trees in the compound—apple, cherry, peach, pear, and plum intermixed. Some number of the bushes inside the compound are currant— black, red, white—and dewberry and raspberry, while others are flowering. There are many structures comprising the Outs Inn. Each is shown on the accompanying map and described below.

**A1. **Main **Entrance Two reinforced wooden gates, each 8 feet wide and 12 feet high, lead into the forepart of the cobbled courtyard. Any arrival here by horse or wheeled vehicle will be heard plainly by the stable boys and grooms on duty in buildings 4 and 5. The Castle Keeper might wish to include a pair of mastiffs that bark a welcome to persons entering, thus alerting the staff. If added, these dogs patrol in the cobbled courtyard at night, being trained to stay in that area. Guests, after dismounting, are escorted to area

3. There are 17 handle mounts and vehicles here.

By day Groom Wilfred is the stable manager. He is a tall but average-looking man of around 35. He is assisted by the stable boys: Merton, a boy of 16, and Grins, a cheerful lad of 12.

Groom Wilfred _(He _is _a _ueutral _good, _humau, _3rd _leeel _fighter_ _whose _eital _stats _are: _HP _17, _AC _13. _His _prime _attributes _are: _str,_ _cou, _cha. _He _carries _riug _mail _aud _a _dagger.)_

At dark the groom is Big Roger, a dark fellow age near 40. He is assisted by the stable boy Morris.

Big Roger _(He is a ueutral good, humau, 4th leeel fighter whose_ _eital _stats _are: _HP _26, _AC _13. _His _prime _attributes _are: _str, _cou,_ _cha. _He _carries _riug _mail _aud _a _dagger.)_

The day porter is Byron, a heavy-set and strong chap of some 50 years. He is polite and talkative. After 10 PM the night porter is George, an older, taciturn man of near 70 but quite spry.

Byron _(He _is _a _lawful _ueutral, _humau, _5th _leeel _fighter _whose _eital_ _stats _are: _HP _33, _AC _13. _His _prime _attributes _are: _str, _cou, _cha._ _He _carries _riug _mail _aud _a _dagger.)_

Mastiffs _(HD _3d8, _HP _15, _AC _14, _PA _physical, _AT _1 _bit, _DA_ _2-8.)_

**A2. Side Entrance** Two reinforced wooden gates, each five feet wide and 10 feet high, lead into the rear of the cobbled courtyard. This gate is used mainly for the pickup and delivery of laundry, provisions, and goods stored in the goods storage facility. The Castle keeper might also wish to include another pair of mastiffs here (see above) that bark a welcome to tradesmen entering, thus alerting the staff. If added, these dogs patrol in a pack in the cobbled courtyard at night.

The inn’s laundry (aprons, table linens, bed sheets and the like) are washed and dried by the Riverside Laundress, an establishment at the end of Nemo Road. A cart delivers clean laundry to the inn in the early afternoon, taking away the soiled linen to be washed and returned the following day.

**A3. Loggia-like Portico** This roofed walkway leads from the cobbled courtyard to the main entrance of the inn. It continues all along the front of that structure, and then turns south and covers the path all the way to the last of the four private villas.

1. **Stables and Feed Storage** There are accommodations for as many as 30 animals here. There are two riding and four draught horses here for rental purposes. Outdoor stabling at hitching posts can accommodate 16 additional horses. The floor above the stables has four rooms for staff members. Who lives in them is a matter for the Castle Keeper to decide.

The stable master is Jason Barger, a handsome sort, about age 30 with long chestnut hair and spade beard, who is an excellent horseman and good judge of character. Jason is a cousin of the owner and he is currently making moves on his cousin Gretchen

Gunderson. He is thinking to make her his mistress–temporarily at least. If the party are spying for Uvoll, the wizardly right-hand man of the Marquis Talworth, Jason is one of the contacts. He has been promised status as a gentleman and ownership of the inn, should the Marquis rule the area. He can lead them to a gang of cutthroats in Yggsburgh who are glad to take the Marquis’ coin to make trouble in the town (see Yggsburg Encounter 59, River Rat Tavern). Jason is a pigeon fancier and has a dovecote at one end of the first floor of the stable building. Several of the birds are homing pigeons he uses to communicate with the marquis’ other agents.

Grooms “Red” Weaver and Tyler Watson, neither very bright, both in their early 20s, and needing supervision, serve as footmen for a rented carriage or coach. With them are stableboys William “Little Willie” Blue and Edwin “Eddie” Eager.

1. **Coach **and **Carriage **Barn As many as 12 vehicles can be kept in this place. There is a small and a large carriage, plus a large coach for rent, so only nine customers’ vehicles can be housed most of the time. The floor above the barn has eight rooms for staff members. Who lives in them is a matter for the Castle Keeper to decide.

The barn master is “Wheels” Littleham, a short but strong man who loves carriage and coach work. His assistant is Sylvester Drover, who will serve as a coachman when so required. The hands are Bertie Wilson and Helga Rivers, who see to cleaning vehicles and general labor here.

“Wheels” Littleham _(He _is _a _chaotic _good, _humau, _3rd _leeel_ _fighter whose eital stats are: HP 19, AC 13. His prime attributes_ _are: _str, _cou, _cha. _He _carries _riug _mail _aud _a _+2 _dagger.)_

1. **Goods Storage Facility** To the north are five locked storerooms, while in the south is a long open area for goods of no great value. The storehouse master is Tad the Packer, a husky fellow of average looks, blond hair cropped short, always willing to talk about the value of goods and how to pack and move them around. He keeps his battle axe handy. The grooms are called on to move things stored here when necessary. “Packer” assists the porter when needed.

1. **Kitchen and Bakery** This large detached building is where all the food for the inn is prepared. It is at a distance because of the odors, heat, and fire danger. To the south of this place is an extensive herb and vegetable garden that supplies fresh produce for the inn from late spring through late autumn.

Harold Greene, the Head Chef, comes in at 11 AM. He is an irascible, bald man of 40 years who cooks superb food, and demands acknowledgement of his artful creations. Matilda Button, the Cook, works from 5 AM until 3 PM. She is a large and rather plump woman of 37 years who is meticulous and hard-working, making all the more ordinary food with the help of Burns. She is very fond of Harold, but her affection is not returned. Donald Burns, the Assistant Cook, works from 8 AM on. He is 25, a former kitchen attendant of a noble, who dreams of opening his own eating house. Fred the Baker, a somewhat portly chap of around age 30 who enjoys his pastries, is the chief baker. Chalf Brownly, the baker’s helper, is a lad of 15 who is learning the trade. The scullions are Fay Harper, Murdoch Downey, Karna Hill, and Terrance Griner, who are aged 17, 38, 23, and 20 respectively. They are typical of the lower class town dwellers, though Fay is quite well-built and pretty.

**Outs Inn (proper)** The Outs Inn is a large and busy place. The Castle Keeper must consult the Outs Inn Guests Encounter Table in Appendix C in order to determine what other persons, and in what numbers, are staying here. That table also includes a sub-

table detailing those guests and any possible adventure associated with them. It would be best to undertake this prior to, rather than during, play in order to expedite action at the game table.

The prices of goods and services at the Outs Inn are listed below, after which comes a description of particular areas of the inn.

1. **Lobby Entrance and Waiting** The floor here is of slate tiles, with red rugs over them in non-traffic areas. The walls are whitewashed, walnut, wainscoted, and display many oil paintings. These are mainly of the Gunderson males, Lord Yggs in several poses, and all of the Lords Mayor of Yggsburgh, including the current one, Druid Lochinvar Beechwood. There is an L-shaped counter immediately to the north of the entrance. This bar is 20 feet long, and it is where overnight guests are served. To the east of this is a large desk and cabinets for record storage. Along the south wall just beyond the entry are racks for hanging outer garments in cold weather, and after that a half-dozen padded armchairs. Any time after 7 AM and before 7 PM, the innkeeper, Goodman Walter Gunderson, and his wife, Goodwife Helga Gunderson, are on duty to greet and see to the settling in or departure of a guest. They are assisted by their children, the eldest pair of whom see to the management of the place when their parents are not on duty.

The innkeeper, Goodman Walter Gunderson, is a solid citizen of 56 years. He is jolly when things are in order, and a good parent. Walter is tall, heavy, and clean shaven, with only a fringe of reddish hair remaining, so that his girth and bright blue eyes are the first things noted. As a good businessman, he welcomes all who can pay and he remembers names and faces. Those who are regular customers are recognized and address him by name. He does not talk about other guests but, when not busy, he is happy to discuss most other polite subjects, especially over a pint of ale.

The Goodwife Helga Gunderson is a tall and plump woman of age 50 with gray hair, and shows signs of the good looks she had as a girl. Helga is a strict disciplinarian, but otherwise a doting mother, whose concern is to see that all of her children do well, not just Rudolph (who will inherit the inn). She has no time for small talk, but choice gossip might lure her into conversation.

Ingeborg Gunderson is the youngest daughter, age 11, who clears tables in the dining room. A tall and pretty young girl with her titian blonde hair worn in a long braid down her back. Ingeborg is strong for her age, serious, and a willing worker.

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

Karl Gunderson is the youngest son, age 13, who clears tables in the dining room and does other menial chores at the inn. Young Karl could pass for 16, as he is big and strong. He prefers to be outside fishing, hunting, or playing at arms to being a servant. His mother does not like this, especially his admiration for Jason Barger, her husband’s “no good” cousin who encourages such “foolishness.” Karl wants to become a horse breeder and own a large farm where he can hunt and fish.

Lavinia Gunderson, age 16, serves meals in the dining room. She is a very pretty girl with flaxen hair she wears in a bun, as her mother does. Lavinia is practical, strong-willed, and knows she will marry a handsome man with property, so that she will be mistress of a fine household.

Olaf Gunderson, age 18, assists serving in the bar room. He is able but lazy. He prefers to drink and be merry with the opposite sex, rather than do regular routine work, and his clean good looks make him popular with the local girls, even some female patrons, much to the concern of his mother and father. Olaf knows he must make his own way, and his plan is to become a warrior of sorts, perhaps a guard for a merchant at first, with an eye towards grander things, adventure and wealth.

Drogat Gunderson, age 20, is barkeep much of the time. He is a rather plain fellow, a no-nonsense sort of young man cut from the same cloth as his mother. He has learned a good deal of combat by being a member of the local militia and from handling rowdy patrons. Although he is not as tall as is typical for a Gunderson, he is wiry and naturally strong. Drogat hopes to save sufficient funds so that one day he can open his own small place, a tavern if not a full-blown inn. As bartender, he hears and sees much. Drinking little, he knows much of what goes on, and he suspects his cousin Jason Barger is a subversive, but kinship prevents him from revealing what he believes to his father, Walter.

Gretchen Gunderson, age 22, is assistant manager of the inn. She is a most pretty young woman, a Valkyrie-type, tall, buxom, and strong. She combines her father’s commercial sense with her mother’s practicality. She has several beaux, and would have married Rodney Meadows, the eldest son of a local gentleman farmer, but for her devotion to her parents. She feels she must stay and assist in running the inn until Lavinia or another of her siblings can assume her managerial duties. Currently, her cousin Jason is making advances on her, but Gretchen is not impressed or interested despite Jason’s lavish spending.

Rudolph Gunderson, age 25, is the night innkeeper and an excellent swordsman, as well as a lieutenant in the local militia. He is larger and stronger than his brother Drogat, stands over six feet tall and weighs no less than 200 pounds. He is a fine young man, but one who causes his parents concern. Rudolph is not really interested in being an ostler. Just as his younger brother Olaf, he too would rather be an adventurer. While Rudolph has all that it takes, including natural drive, he remains at the inn. His father expects that his eldest son Rudolph will inherit the inn when he passes on. Many a local lass has her cap set on him, because of that and his rather handsome appearance.

1. **Dining Room** Ordinary servants are not permitted here! The room has golden oak flooring and like wall paneling. The walls are decorated with bright paintings of still life sort—fruit, flowers, vegetables, eggs, game birds ready for plucking. This large room has two big fireplaces at either end for warmth in winter. There are 15 tables spaced at wide intervals in the place so as to ensure both comfort and relative privacy for patrons. Long sideboards to east and west hold table service ware, and drink and food dishes when meals are being served. Meals are served here from 6 AM to 9 PM, 11 AM to 2 PM, and 6 PM to 8 PM, and after 8 PM only cold food is available.

The head serving man here is the 42-year-old Albert. He is a nervous and thin fellow of impeccable performance in his duties. The morning service is handled by Belinda Stout, a woman of 45 years. She is large, stern, and of the very able sort. Serving during noon and evening meals are Susan White and Robert Diggs, aged 24 and 27 respectively. They are both well-trained at table service.

1. **Main Hallway** This room is wainscoted and floored in oak, with a long carpet of deep green covering its center. The walls are whitewashed, making this place restful to the eye. There are many windows along the south wall, and several small tables and large chairs are placed along the length of this corridor. Paintings of chase scenes, hunting dogs, and game animals are hung on the north wall. Note the two staircases to rooms on the first and second floors.
1. **Lounge Ordinary servants are not permitted in this room. It is paneled in fruitwood, cherry and apple, half-way up, floored in oak and carpeted with various patterned rugs, with two large fireplaces on the north wall for warmth in winter. Various landscape paintings and bright tapestries showing people from the past decorate the pale yellow walls. There are finely upholstered chairs and divans in six groupings here, each around a low table, each grouping seating up to 10 persons.

One of the Gunderson family checks on this room every half hour or so from around 10 AM until Midnight to see is there are patrons in need of service. If so, they alert either the Dining Room or Bar Room personnel, or else see to minor service personally.

1. **Bar Room This place is fully paneled in maple, with paintings of hunting and sporting events decorating the walls. The oak floor is uncarpeted. There is a large fireplace on the north wall. The bar proper runs most of the length of the west wall, and 10 persons standing at it are accommodated without problem. There is a concealed door in the southwest corner accessing the lounge. The eastern two-thirds of the room has 12 tables of varying size with chairs to seat up to 40 patrons. If the crowd exceeds this capacity, the door to the lounge is opened, and overflow is seated and served there.

Olaf and Drogat Gunderson are the main bartenders here. During very busy nights Gretchen Gunderson and the flirtatious Alita Hobbs, a maid of 18 years, are serving tables here.

Perry Fish is the other man who tends bar, he being a very large fellow of about 30 years, and a good conversationalist and listener. Perry knows all the local gossip and much lore regarding the area. If he is well-treated to drink and gratuities, he will relate much. Perry is a friend of Jason the Stablemaster and an unwitting accomplice in Uvoll’s spy and traitor ring, he relating all “choice” information to Jason or Jason’s gang of associates.

Of the latter, four to six of these will be found here during a busy weekend. Describe them as well-dressed young bravos of generally average looks that have a slightly overbearing stir about them, an attitude of superiority, and acting in a somewhat aggressive manner. If any are slain, simply cross off their names from the roster of such miscreants. Uvoll’s gang members are listed below. Their class division should be about equal, but more of fighters than of thieves in most circumstances.

Perry Fish _(He is a chaotic good, humau, 6th leeel fighter whose_ _eital _stats _are: _HP _40, _AC _13. _His _prime _attributes _are: _str, _cou,_ _dex. _His _siguificaut _attribute _is: _str _14. _He _carries _riug _mail, _mace_ _aud _dagger.)_

###### Encounters in Yggsburgh

1. **Private **Salon: This place is available to anyone willing to pay the rental fee of 1gp per hour, or 5gp for up to eight hours. It is a walnut, wainscoted room with walls above painted blue, thus the Blue Salon. There are paintings of river and lake scenes on the walls, as well as mounted fish of great size. It has an oak floor with several small carpets scattered around on it. In addition to the large fireplace on the north wall, there are three tables that can be set together for a banquet or a meeting, 14 straight-backed chairs and four upholstered ones in the chamber.
1. **Private **Salon: The same as K above, only this is the Red Salon, and the decorations are all of martial sort.
1. **Open Meeting Room** Ordinary servants are not permitted here! This place is open to any other sort of guest of the inn for a quiet business meeting. The room is much like K and L above, although its walls above the woodwork are painted green, so it is the Green Salon. Paintings here are of the major buildings and street scenes in Yggsburgh—the Citadel, the Temple, Market Plaza, etc. In the corners of the chamber there are four tables with six padded chairs around each.
1. **Gaming Room This big chamber is open at all times. It has a large fireplace in the center of the north wall. The walls are fully paneled in light-colored pine, and there are a few paintings here showing scenes of sports and game play. The floor in the southern half of the room is slate, for this is where the billiard and snooker tables stand, as well as a pair of dart boards.

The upper (northern) portion of the room has a large card table for as many as eight players, two tables seating four persons each, and three small tables for two-person games. Decks of cards, backgammon and chess sets, and various other games such as checkers and dominoes, are found in the cabinets spaced along the east and west walls. If there is overflow for game play, the Green Salon is used.

On weekends several young men of “sporting” sort, friends of Jason the Stablemaster (and willing accomplices in Uvoll’s spy and traitor ring) will be found playing herein.

Four to six of these dastards will be found here, their class division being more thieves than fighters. Describe them as well-dressed young bravos of generally average looks that have a slightly overbearing sir about them, an attitude of superiority and condescension. If any are slain, simply cross off their names from the roster of such miscreants.

**First **Floor These rooms are well appointed, with hardwood floors, fine carpeting, wainscoted walls, and a broad central hallway with large windows at the east and west end. At dark it has magical illumination coming from bronze and crystal fixtures spaced along the walls. There are two three-room suites and four two-room suites on this floor.

The chamber maids are Boann Conner, age 39, “Mother” Tilde Voss, age 47, and Yolanda Garza, age 32. They are all sturdy, hard working peasant-type women of meticulous sort. These three also take care of the three villas along with assistance from any of the lesser status chamber maids not busy on the second floor or loft.

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh



**Second Floor** The second floor is less lavishly appointed, but similar to the first floor, and also magically lit when dusk comes. There are 24 large single rooms spaced 12 per side here. There is a linen closet opposite the stairway to the uppermost floor.

The chamber maids are Clarinda Thatcher, age 17, Hope Bidwell, age 22, Margot Grover, age 31, Vilone Larchmont, age 28, and Winnie Goode, age 19. They are typical maids and all of reasonably attractive sort.

**Loft** This spartan space is divided into four dormitory rooms sleeping up to 14 persons each, these areas being mainly for the servants of wealthy patrons. There is also a small linen room and a closet for cleaning supplies up here.

The chamber maids are Gilda Burns, age 33, Madge Lowton, age 20, and Trudy Metz, age 28, who are also typical maids, and of generally plain and hefty sort. They work as a team, going from dormitory to dormitory as needed.

**Basement** This is a partial basement, accessed by doors under the steps leading to the upper floors. The stairs to the east lead to several large store rooms and a wine cellar. The door is always locked and only the Gunderson family has keys to it. It has various sizes of wooden barrels containing wine, small ones filled with brandy, racks of bottled wine, and shelves of liquor and liqueurs.


**Servant **Dining The west door leads downstairs to a 50-foot-long corridor ending in a refectory, in which the inn’s lesser help and guests’ servants eat. This room is 40 feet long north-to-south, 30 feet wide, and has a fireplace in the middle of its north wall. Along the west wall are two archways leading to a 40-foot-long, 10-foot- wide sub-kitchen with another fireplace and various kitchen furnishings. Herbal tea, porridge, beans, soup, stews, and like common fare are prepared for servants’ dining. Leftovers from the bakery and main kitchen supplement the menu, these being sent down by dumbwaiter from the dining room above.

“Old” Luffle is a crotchety man of over 60 years. He is the cook. The server and potboy is “Little Nog” Noggin, a hulking lad of around 14, who is a bit slow-witted but most cheerful. If there are paying patrons eating, inn staff will see to serving them before getting their own food from the kitchen.

Also here when not busy outdoors will be Herbert Grafton, the gardener and groundskeeper for the green.

Herbert Grafton _(He _is _a _ueutral _good, _humau, _3rd _leeel _fighter_ _whose _eital _stats _are: _HP _15, _AC _12. _His _prime _attributes _are: _str, cou, _dex. _His _siguificaut _attribute _is: _str _13. _His _secoudary _skill _is: woodsmau. He carries leather armor, guisarme or pruuiug hook_ _aud _heaey _kuife.)_

1. **Private **Villa **for **Guests There are four villas but only three

are for rent, as the southernmost and largest has been converted into a chape (below). Each of the three smaller villas has a lower main room and an upper floor for sleeping. Each is separated from the adjacent buildings by lawn and a thick privet hedge.

A villa has a fireplace and lavatory on each floor. The ground floor has a dining area in the main room and a lounge. All furniture is very well made and the wall decorations are of good artistic sort, although not expensive per se. There is in each a rear door leading outside the inn compound. This door is concealed from both the inside and outside.

**Chapel Building** As the Gundersons are devout, they recently decided to make the large villa into a chapel, so that guests could attend services there, pray, and have the care of a priest. The northern portion of the villa is the cleric’s office, and the southern part has an area for worship but is not the chapel proper. It is 50 feet east-to-west, and 20 feet north-to-south. It has a shrine and image of the deity honored (Castle Keeper’s choice), an altar, pulpit, and in the western 30-foot section comfortable pews for as many as four dozen worshippers to be seated in.

The Venerable Ragly the Devout is a vigorous man of some 40 years who is honest and devout. Ragly is most interested in helping others so that they come to have faith in his deity. He collects fees for his services in order to keep up and improve the chapel, as well as to assist the poor in The Outs. The income from this place has allowed him to build a shrine in The Outs, where he also preaches and holds services. A lesser cleric, who is a follower of his, resides there and tends to the daily needs of those who come to the shrine.

Ragly the Devout assists characters with all manner of spells, but he expects that in return, those with the wherewithal to be generous in their contributions to the chapel and to his good works to aid the needy will do so. Persons who accept his deity as their principal one are expected to contribute at least 5gp per level of spell he used to assist them. Those of other faiths are expected to voluntarily give at least twice that for such services.

Ragly the Devout _(He _is _a _good, _humau, _10th _leeel _cleric _whose_ _eital _stats _are: _HP _50, _AC _22. _His _prime _attributes _are: _str, _wis, cha._ _His_ _siguificaut_ _attribute_ _is:_ _str_ _16._ _His_ _secoudary_ _skill_ _is: judgmeut. He carries +2 full plate armor, +2 shield, +4 mace_ _aud _staff. _He _cau _cast _the _followiug _uumber _of _clerical _spells: _0-5,_ _1st-4, _2ud-4, _3rd-3, _4th-3, _5th-2._

1. **Bank and Currency Exchange** The bank has a small outer room of about 10 feet square, walled off, and with a barred window above a counter ledge in its west allowing customer service. There is a steel door to the south that allows entry to a 10-foot-wide, 20- foot-long office for transacting business with important customers (such as those wishing to make a large deposit, exchange money, or here because of a letter of credit to be drawn up or cashed). Behind that is a 20-foot by 30-foot working office in which the personnel break and rest. A cabinet and two chairs with a small table are along the west side of this back room. There is a strongbox in here beside the desk on the north wall. The heavy iron box weighs 500 pounds and has two locks, both protected by mechanical traps and magical ones. It normally holds a total of 2,500gp in various coin.
###### Encounters in Yggsburgh

Profits from a day’s operation are taken home by the banker. The bank is open from 8 AM until 6 PM only.

The banker is Jebel van der Leeks, a small and nervous man of about 50 years. He has a fine house in town. The teller is Henry MacDugal, an average sort of accountant-type. He signals the banker by a pull cord if a customer needs attention. A level near his knee drops a locking steel shutter over the window grill if he is threatened. It also sounds a general alarm throughout the compound.

The men and the place are well-protected by magical guards and wards. It is left in the able hands of the Castle Keeper to add all the protective amulets, charms, and talismans for the personnel, as well as glyphs and sigils inflicting damage on would-be robbers. This is not a place where reckless and greedy characters can gain wealth, and that should be made apparent to any player considering robbery.

###### Services

**Changing **Currency: There is a fee of 5% of the amount changed to local coinage.

**Buying Gems:** Only diamonds and corundum gems (rubies and sapphires of all colors) will be purchased. The payment will be 90% of standard value when traded for precious metal or goods.

**Loans:** Loans from 50gp to 25,000gp are possible at this establishment. All loans are made secured against property (personal items such as a fine carriage, a horse, armor, jewelry, objects d’art, or real property within a 20-mile radius to which a notarized deed can be given over). Appraisal is made by the banker with the assistance of the teller, both being experts. The loan amount is 50% of assessed value of personal property, up to 75% of the value of real property. Money is paid the day following the signing of the agreement for the loan. Interest is 2% of the amount in transaction fee, and 2% of the loan amount per month or fraction thereof. If interest is not paid as specified in the signed agreement, then notice of foreclosure against the secured property is posted one week thereafter and foreclosure is legally perfected three weeks thereafter. For example, 500gp borrowed against a jeweled necklace worth 1000gp for a period of one week would have, as a requirement, total repayment of the loan in seven days, the amount called for being 520gp.

**Available **Money: For exchange there is no more that 1000gp per day except by pre-arrangement. Drawing on a letter of credit is the same, 1000gp per day limit save by pre-arrangement. In regard to gem purchases, no more than 500gp is available for such purchase, save by pre-arrangement.

Jebel van der Leeks and Henry MacDugal _(Nou _combatauts,_ _HD 1d6, HP eariable, AC 10, PA iut, SK busiuess.)_

**Q Notary** The notary is open from 8 AM to 6 PM. This establishment has two arm chairs and a table in the front room for patrons waiting to be served. The rear room of larger size has a desk, three chairs, and various file cabinets. The notary will sign and seal all legal documents brought to him. The fee is 3gp

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

per document, but transfer deeds where there is a value above 1,200gp are at 3gp per, while those above 2,500gp are notarized at 6gp per. Copies are available from the scribe below.

The notary under seal of the Town of Yggsburgh is Kalvid Fleur (non-combatant), a pudgy, fussy fellow around age 35 who had hoped to become an attorney, but was unable to pass the examination so settled for notary status.

Kalvid Fleur _(Nou _combataut, _HD _1d6, _HP _2, _AC _10, _PA _iut,_ _SK _busiuess.)_

1. **Scribe** The scribe is closely associated with the Outs Inn. This establishment handles both the recording of meetings and copying of documents. The front of the place is the waiting room, and it has a half-dozen chairs and a table. The rear is accessed by a magically-locked door that leads to the scribe’s workroom, this always being done in private. As he is sometimes at the inn proper, recording what is said in a business meeting, there is depository slot in the inner door for documents to be copied. Forms to attach to such papers are on the table in the waiting room. The place is open from 8 AM to 6 PM. He charges 5gp per hour for recording and 5sp per page copied.

The scribe is Oldad of Shalik, a lean fellow of swarthy complexion and sharp face. He is well-educated. He lives in the town.

Oldad of Shalik _(He _is _a _lawful _ueutral, _humau, _4th _leeel _wizard_ _whose eital stats are: HP 9, AC 10. His prime attributes are: iut, wis, cha. He carries clothiug. He cau cast the followiug uumber_ _of wizard spells: 0-4, 1st-3, 2ud-2. Special: He possesses the spell_

_Duplicate _Writiug.)_

1. **Valley and Laundry** Its hours are from 5 AM to 7 PM. All manner of tailoring, mending, cobbling, and boot black services are performed here. There is a counter in the front, 10-foot- square, room of this place, where customers come to leave items for service. The remainder of the place, the back, is given over to the various equipment needed for these services, as listed below. The Castle Keeper should infer prices of other services based upon those listed.

The establishment is run by Susan Thatcher, a large woman of middle age who does all the cleaning, pressing, and laundry. She is aided by Harry Quince, the tailor and mender, and Macuba Eastling, who does all the cobbling and boot blacking.

###### Services	Cost



Tailoring	1gp per hour (fitting a doublet

= 5 hours)

Mending	2sp per area



Cobbling stitching	2sp

Boot blacking	2sp per pair


1. **Staff **Cottages This building houses the staff of the Outs Inn. Key staff members are quartered in these four two-storied buildings. The innkeeper’s family now occupies two of these cottages, and the other two are tenanted by the chef and his assistant, and the brewer and his assistant.
1. **Brewery** The brewery belongs to the Outs Inn, though many initially think otherwise. In this place the inn brews its excellent ales, porters, and stouts, with a passable beer also made. Brewing vats and ingredient stores are on the first floor of this stone building. The ground floor is where aging takes place. Barrels of various sizes are brought to the brewery through the carriage barn, and some surplus brew is taken out for sale in Yggsburgh by the same route.

August Elmann is the brewer, he being of some 50 years of age and an excellent brew master. He is assisted by Palley Cromner, a journeyman of 26 years.

1. **Central Courtyard** This area consists of a large lawn broken here and there by flowerbeds. Its main feature is a large reflecting pool in which there are coy, painted turtles and a fountain.
###### Fountain

The water in the fountain is kept aerated by a central double fountain of bronze fish spouting water from their mouths north and south. Naiads pour water from amphorae east and west. Detect Magic will reveal that there is some spell on the fountain. No amount of other investigation will discover anything save for the following:

If Dispel Magic is cast upon the bronze naiad figures between the hours of 10 PM and 4 AM they come to life. Both have been trapped in the statues, and the spell will free them to return to their riverine home. In gratitude, one will give the characters a word of command that will cause the north-facing fish to jet forth up to 12 Healing potions, when commanded to do so at Midnight. The other naiad will relate a word of command for the south facing fish. This bronze figure discharges up to 12 Flame Gout potions, likewise at midnight. The latter potion is detailed in the magic appendix.

If freed, the naiads will remember the characters if they were treated with respect. Naiad Crystalie will be in a river, and if the party is in or on the water and in need of her help, she is 50% likely to appear and aid them. Naiad Auradine will be in Greatfish Lake, and if the party is in or on the lake and in need of her help, she is 50% likely to appear and help them. Each naiad will assist the party only once.

###### Pool

If a Detect Magic spell is cast upon this body of water it will reveal that there is some dweomer active therein. This is because one of the coy is magical. This particular carp is able to speak, and can grant a Limited Wish to any one person it chooses once per year. If this fish is caught and not harmed it will plead for its life, promising to help the party by magical means if they release it back into the pool. All they need to do thereafter is to return and ask for it to aid them, and it will use its power according to their request and the limit of its ability. Should the characters choose to harm or kill this coy, it will curse them with bad luck, so that all concerned will have a penalty of -2 on their to hit die rolls and -1 on damage die rolls from then on until the curse is removed. The curse affects spells, and healing ones will also suffer the indicated penalty.

#### Tinkers’ and Peddlars’ Cottages


**Location: Near the Outs Inn

**Reason: When a character desires to be robbed, here is the palce

#### Gambling Hall


**Location: East road

**Reason: Gambling

This place is a large building with a main room for gambling, a side saloon, several private rooms on the ground floor, and many rooms for rent to travelers on the upper floor. Prices here are the same as in the Boatman Tavern.

The owner and his nine henchmen are tough and dangerous to meddle with. The Castle Keeper should base their classes and stats on other outlaw types running disreputable establishments.

Ther is likely considerable money here. It will be well guarded by magic and mechanical traps, but all is left to the Castle Keeper to determine.

#### The Brick Works


**Location: Mills Road

**Reason:** Should the characters need bricks or employees, or be gathering information

The Brick Works are located on Mills Road, between the Marvel Playhouse to the south and The Mills to the north.

The Brick Works has nearby dwellings housing some 200 persons, about 50 of them being employed making bricks and transporting them. Surrounding the buildings—works proper, kilns, and storage sheds—to the south are vast mounds of clay. These are from the digging of the canal. As that waterway was constructed, it was discovered that the clay being removed for the channel was perfect for making firebricks.

The Brick Works and cottages are owned in fief by Sir Morgan Nalbord (see Yggsburgh Encounter 48. Residence, Sir Morgan Nalbord).


#### The Grist Mill


**Location: On the Urt River

**Reasons: If the party is looking to buy large quantities of grain

This is a large mill house, with a water wheel being driven by a flume diverting water from the Urt River to fall and power the great device. That in turn drives the gears that turn the millstone to powder grain—wheat, oats, or barley. There are some 50 persons working in the town-owned mill, loading whole grain from the four adjacent granaries, bagging flour, carrying it to the storehouse, or loading it into vehicles for transport.

Across from the Grist Mill along Mills road are cottages in which dwell some 200 persons: the workers and their families.

#### The Sawmill


**Location: On the Urt River

**Reason: If one is in need of cut lumber.

This is the second large mill house on the Urt River. It also has a very large water wheel driven by a flume that diverts river water to fall and turn the great device. The wheel’s shaft and gears operate saws that cut logs into timbers and planks. The lumber is used in building structures, boats, ships, and land vehicles, as well as for all manner of furniture. There are some 50 persons working in the sawmill, bringing in logs to be squared, seeing to the cutting of logs into posts or boards, carrying that lumber to the adjacent drying sheds, or loading ready lumber into vehicles for transport.

Across from the Sawmill along Mills Road are cottages in which dwell some 200 persons: the workers and families.

This sawmill and the cottages are owned in fief by Sir Eberhardt Beemish (see Yggsburgh Encounter 46 Residence, Sir Eberhardt Beemish).

#### Music Hall


**Location: On East Road

**Reason: To take in some music

This place is another large wooden building with a main room used for variety performances, an upper floor dance hall, and on the second floor

#### 90: Dining Salon

**Location: on East road

**Reason: Should the ccharacters need to get a good meal

Despite its neighbors, this establishment serves fine fare in its dining room, hearty food in the tavern room to the side.

Prices in the main room are equal to those of the Outs Inn and about half that in the tavern room. The owner is a businessman but hires three skilled fighting men as guards/bouncers, and the kitchen staff, chef included, are also capable of wielding weapons with considerable skill. The Castle Keeper can devise classes and set stats as desired. There is likely little treasure, but that is left to the Castle Keeper to determine.

#### 91: Animal Fighting Arena

**Location: on East road

**Reason: To watch or bet on animal fights

This timber building is where bear baiting, bull and bear fights, and like “sporting events, including brawling between human fighters, takes place. There are events on the weekends and one in midweek. The owner is a criminal, of course, but he has the backing and protection of one of the Councilmen of the town. There are always two guard henchmen with him from four to eight more around during events. TheCastle Keeper can devise classes and set stats as desired.. Patrons will frequently include the gentry from Yggsburgh, including knights and soldier officers, as well as common soldiers too.

There is likely considerable treasure here during an event, as the house takes bets and pays off the winners, but that is left to the Castle Keeper to determine. private rooms . The owner and his six henchmen are dangerous. The CastleKeeper should base their classes and stats on other outlaw types running a disreputable establishments. There is likely little treasure, but that is left to the Castle Keeper to determine.

# Part III


The Environs of Yggsburgh

# The Environs of Ygghsburgh

## Introduction

†

Part III of this tome details the encounter areas surrounding the Town of Yggsburgh. Herein is contained the description of many villages, thorps, dungeons and encounters. It is voluminous and many an adventure is to be had simply by wandering from place to place.

This section begins with a brief description of those villages, thorps and communities in those areas found on the map. Some are listed on the map while others are not. For the latter, simply place them where it feels best to. This is followed by a description of all those places numbered on the map (2-48). Each of these descriptions has an associated key indicating geographic location, appropriate random encounters table (see Appendices C and D, Urban Encounters and Environs Encounters). There is also a Zagyg Adventure Reference descriptor listing associated names, places or adventures in the region. Some areas contain dungeons while others are brief and small in size. Be sure to reference any appropriate monsters in the Orders of Battle Appendix I, Orders of Battle and Appendix G, New Monsters.

Dark chateu is also located on the map. It is near Castle Zagyg (encounter 2). Dark Chateu is not described or detailed in the volume but is sold seperately.

## Communities of Yggsburgh

†

This section contains a listing and general descrition of many of the villages and thorps found in the environs of Yggsburgh. The list is not exhaustive but should give a good indication of the type of villages and thorps found throughout the region should there be a need to develp them. Should this be undertaken, simply use the information provided in the following descriptions as a guideline. Also, refer to Appendix A, Developing Yggsburgh, Communities of Yggsburgh for an ovreview.

Further, there is a brief decription several generic cost charts for blacksmith items, general store items and costs of tavern’s goods and services are provided below to include a generic description of both a village and a thorp. The latter can be used for describing the layout of any of the particular viallages or thorps not specifically describe in the following section.

The Town of Garham and the village of Stonewyck & Castle Gaxhill are not described in this section. Rather, those two are described as Yggsburgh Environs Encounters 3. Garham and 48. Stonewyck & Castle Gaxhill.

###### Thorps and Villages

Thorps are little communities of freemen, generally farmers, with dwellings only, they being too small to support any commercial shop. Each has a less than a score of houses with barns and outbuildings, and an average population of 120 persons. A small shrine with a non-combatant low-level evil priest serving as spiritual “guide” for the folk of the thorp is the norm.

Each of the villages are located on a watercourse or else have a deep well. Each village consists of about 40 buildings and all have a religious structure, a large shrine or fane. The average population for these communities is 250-300 persons.

The main part of the villages consists of two opposite rows of 16 stone cottages for the villains. Each row is separated into two parts so that eight families work a single section of the manor. There are separate and larger cottages for the reeve, cowherd, hayward, shepherd, swineherd, and woodward. One to two buildings of somewhat larger size are rented by freemen. One being an ale house or tavern while the other is a smith or general merchant. Each of the row houses has a tool shed and a garden behind it. Further back are four commonly used barns for large livestock and feed, as well as various wooden houses, sheds, and coups for farm equipment and smaller animals. At one end of the street between these structures is the village fane in which the town’s religious leader dwells and holds services. The grounds around the fane are lawn and gardens but of no great extent. Behind this is the local burial ground.

A thorp or village will have a shrine or chapel overseen by a cleric of low level (1st-3rd). A hamlet will have a fane with two clerics, one of moderate level (4th-6th) and an assistant of low level. all towns have multiple religious buildings--shrines, chapels (and chantries), fanes, temples, and likely a grand temple (similar to a cathedral.). The larger places will have a principle cleric of high level (7th or above), two or theee moderate level, and as many or more low-level assistant clerics.

The following charts list generic prices for the taver, merchant or blacksmith in the villages.

#### Villages of the Bald Hills

**Adventure **References: 7: The Hunt

**Location: Bald Hills

**Type: See text

**Encounters: Thorp or Hamlet Green Events

In addition to this region being the former home of the current Lord Mayor of Yggsburgh, the Druid Lochinvar, this area is also home to a small tribe of elves living peacefully under its boughs. The Castle Keeper should decide whether or not the elves live in a small village or are nomadic. The elves number about 200 of which about 50 are warrior types. They are led by Trasolin Shrike. He is aided by the priestess Jaylis Goodoaks and the marshal Linvillion Lunxkin. The home or residence of Trasolin Shrike has 6 elixirs of healing which heal 4-16 point of damage, 20 gems worth 10-1000gp each and 25gp.

Trasolin Shrike _(He _is _a _ueutral _good, _eleeu, _7th/7th _leeel _fighter/_ _wizard. _His _eital _stats _are: _HP _35, _AC _16. _His _prime _attributes are: str, iut.

tollkeeper’s cottage on the east side of the bridge. This dwelling is now inhabited by a family that earns a livelihood selling smoked fish and bread to passing travelers. The only other habitation around is a farm some distance southeast of the road.

#### Villages of Broadview Valley

**Location: Broadview Valley

**Adventure **References: 32. Gypsies and Enfoefflement **Name and Type:** Fairbank (thorp), Berrydale (thorp) **Encounters:** Thorp or Hamlet Green Events

There are two thorps in this area, Fairbank (T4) and Berrydell (T5). These are little communities with dwellings only. Each of the two has less than a score of homes with barns and outbuildings for livestock and storage of goods. They each have about a population of 120 persons. A small shrine with a priest (low level and not combat oriented) serves as a spiritual guide for the folk of the thorp in which he is located.

Each adult in the thorps has a purse with 1-4gp value in coins of various types per level or hit dice on his or her person. Within each house is a hidden cache of 5-50gp value in coin and objects (jewelry, plate, candelabra etc), with 1-20gp value in coin and items in the shrines.

The western half of the Broadview Valley acknowledges the overlordship of Yggsbugh. It is in an exposed position along the River Nemo and with a main road traversing its length, this fertile valley poses a thorny problem for the free town’s rulers. Should they encourage settlers from Yggsburgh to move into the place by granting them land freeholds? Assist in building a community as far east as possible? This would allow the knighting of two or three eligible wealthy gentlemen who, with manors populated by prisoners released from confinement and made villains, could build castles and help defend the valley and the town.

However, such a move would surely arouse the ire of the free miners of the Glittering Knobs as well as all the independent folk in and around the Broadview Valley for miles, including Garham and its allies. As with the Lonely Valley and Norvale, eastwards encroachment on the free borderlands brings angry reaction from all around. Civil strife invites invasion, something being easily accomplished in this area.

When called to arms by the Lord Mayor of Yggsburgh, the total free population fields can mount a formidable force. This is discussed in Appendix I, Orders of Battle, Broadview Valley.

#### Coverdale

**Location: The Wild Mead

**Adventure **Reference: 33: Mushrooms at the Brown Jug

**Name and Type: Coverdale (**hamlet) **Encounters: Thorp or Hamlet Green Events

This halfling hamlet is hidden in the hills of the East Uplands and, because of this, is named Coverdale. It has a population of a bit over 300 halflings. It is mainly a farming thorp but, the little community has more than just dwellings. Coverdale has a smithy, a general store and a tavern in addition to a large shrine.

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

All the buildings are low-roofed, with a loft at about eight feet above ground, extending the building’s height by six feet. All are built into a hillside so that at least a third of each structure is underground. Each place has a stout oaken entry door and similar shutters on its small windows.

Other than magic items noted in the possession each halfling, the head of a household has a purse with 3-10gp of various coin per level or hit dice on his or her person. Also, in each of the 40 houses in the hamlet is a hidden cache of 25-250gp. For the tavern, shrine and merchant this number is multiplied by five.

Other than the three halflings detailed in the tavern, general store and smithy, 35 of the 300 halflings here are armed and able combatants. These halflings are detailed in Appendix I, Orders of Battle, Coverdale.

###### General Store

The general store carries the usual goods, all from demi-human peddlers and sized for halflings. The proprietor is Jessip Littler. See the Merchant’s Items list at the beginning of this section for a list of goods and costs for the general store’s items (page 106).

Jessip Littler _(He is a ueutral good, halfliug whose eital stats are:_ _HD 1d6, HP 4, AC 11. His prime attributes are: physical. He_ _carries clothiug aud if carryiug a weapou he has a staff.)_

###### Smithy

This is a full-fledged smithy where smithing is carried on by Reber Holman. He is also the community’s chief man. He is able to do all common work from tool and horseshoe making to sharpening of edges. See the Blacksmith’s Items list at the beginning of this section for a list of goods and costs for the items at the smithy (page 106).

Reber Homan _(He is a chaotic ueutral, halfliug, 5th leeel fighter._ _His _eital _stats _are: _HP _30 _aud _AC _15. _His _prime _attributes _are_ _str, _dex _aud _iut. _His _siguificaut _attribute _is: _dex _16. _He _has _a_ _secoudary _skill _iu: _leadership. _He _has _leather _armor, _a _shield, _a _+3_ _war hammer aud shortbow.)_

###### The Brown Jug (Tavern)

**Encounters: Small Tavern Common Room, Outside the Small Tavern Events

The Brown Jug (one hangs from a pole beside the door) is scaled to patrons of the size of small demi-humans such as dwarves, gnomes, and of course halflings. Humans will be cramped and uncomfortable when attempting to sit on the chairs, stools, and benches in this place but, accommodation for them on a bearskin rug will be made if they rescue the hamlet’s druidess from certain death (see Environs, 33: Mushrooms at the Brown Jug). The tavern is operated by Barleyman Glen.

Barleyman Glen _(He _is _a _chaotic _ueutral, _halfliug, _3rd/5th _leeel_ _fighter/thief _whose _eital _stats _are: _HP _16, _AC _14. _His _prime_ _attributes are str, dex aud iut. His siguificaut attribute is: dex 16. He has a secoudary skill iu: leadership. He has leather armor, a_

#### Villages of Dunfalcon Pike

**Adventure **References:** 36. Bandits, Thieves & Highwaymen

**Location:** Dunfalcon Pike **Name **and **Type: See below **Encounters:** See below

The Dunfalcon Pike is a reasonably well-maintained and patrolled highway leading west some 300 road miles to the city it is named for. The pike passes through the lands of four independent nobles. From east to west they are the Barony of Redfort, County of Kallent, County of Herdley and thence into the territory of the Free City of Dunfalcon.

There are sufficient settlements along the road to make travel through its considerable length possible without great hardship. There are five hamlets with coaching inns between Yggsburgh and Dunfalcon. The journey from Yggsburgh to Dunfalcon takes

six days by coach. On average, there are only four farm thorps in the 50-mile distance between the hamlets. These near the former because of the uninhabited and wild nature of the land between town and city.

Heading east along the Dunfalcon Pike from Yggsburg to Dunfalcon, one encounters the thorps and villages listed below. Use appropriate encounter tables for each.

#### The Purple Tower and Dradvil

**Location: Purple Tower Road

**Adventure **Reference: 43. Danger at Dradvil

**Name **and **Type: See below

**Encounters: See below

###### The Purple Tower

Drab Hill reaches a height of 70 feet above the surrounding land. It has steep sides of solid rock save on the south where grassy ground lies in a long and moderate incline leading to a hollow at its base. Perched atop the Drab Hill stands the castle stronghold of Lord Uvoll, a sly wizard that is the chief henchman of Edgar, the current Marquis of Talworth. His escutcheon is on a field of white sprinkled with (semy) black mole-like creatures (voles) an inescutcheon of red with a white wolf’s head whose tongue and teeth are black, eyes red.

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

This fortress is built of an ugly purple-hued granite, thus its name. Where the hill has a moderate slope there is a stout wall of 20- foot height with two square corner towers of 35-foot elevation. In the center of this 100-foot-long curtain wall is a squat rectangular gatehouse of 25-foot height. The portal is protected by a drawbridge crossing a dry ditch, and the usual portcullis and gates. The entry leads to a level courtyard of some 80 feet width and like breadth to the south, narrowing to 60 feet at the rear, with stables and work sheds built against the walls to east and west. At its north edge stands the main castle. This is a complex consisting of seven cylindrical towers with conical roofs adding 15 feet to the stated tower dimensions hereafter. These towers are built around and adjoining several rectangular keep structures. There are two scorpion war engines (very large crossbows worked by three-man crews) on the roof of each tower.

The whole of the keep complex has no outer wall with the exception of the fore-quarter where the entry is. Its structures are built on the solid rock of the hill they stand on with the hillsides here being nearly sheer stone palisades for 30 or so feet down. The front consists of two towers of 35-foot height (50 feet counting the conical roof) and 20-foot diameter flanking a projecting entry wing of the keep. The entry wing is 40 feet wide, 10 feet deep, 30 feet tall at the peak of its roof and set back from the flanking towers by 10 feet.

Each front flank tower is built against a tower of 45-foot height (60 feet counting the conical roof) and 25-foot diameter. These rearward structures projecting sideways beyond the smaller towers in front of them by five feet. Between these two greater cylinders and behind the front wing is a central rectangular building around 40 feet in width and 25 feet in depth, it being 60 feet high at its roof peak (the same height as the two towers’ conical roofs that stand on its east and west sides).

Abutting this central structure’s rear are a rectangular building (it being offset some 20 feet to the east on the eastern half) and a cylindrical tower on the western half. The main part of this rear building is 40 feet in width and 35 feet in depth, its height being 80 feet at its roof peak. On its western side is an addition of a 20-foot square tower-like extension of 35-foot height with a battlemented roof. Abutting this building on the east is a great tower of 80-foot height (95-foot with its conical roof included) and 30-foot diameter. This great tower is flanked and abutted by a lesser tower on its western side. This small tower itself is touching the rear middle flanking tower. This latter projecting structure is 40-foot height (55 feet counting the conical roof) and 25-foot diameter. Also abutting the main building’s northeast corner and the north of the great tower is another tower of 50-foot height (65 feet counting the conical roof) and 20-foot diameter.

The wizard Lord Uvoll Darktarn lives here. In his service are his seneschal Dragoman Kydar his spymaster Osbert Updyke, 10 mounted men and 24 men-at-arms who guard the castle. For details on Lord Uvoll, his henchmen and the levie of the area, please see the Appendix I, Orders of Battle, Lord Uvoll and the Purple Tower.

Lord Uvoll controls the town of Dradvill and six other villages. He also controls 24 manors. Half of his fief is wooded.


###### Dradvil

This small town of some 3,000 population lies in a hollow at the base of Drab Hill and upon which looms the Purple Tower, the castle stronghold of Lord Uvoll. The walls of Dradvil are low, but built on the surrounding rises, so they mask all but the spire of the town temple and the square turret of its central hall. There are some 20 square blocks within the walls of the town, most of them being of lower class and a few of middle-class craftsmen and tradesmen, with but two of industrial sort. The town resembles a medieval European community, for its streets are narrow and crooked and there is no city sanitation. In brief, it is not at all like Yggsburgh. The city guards are oppressive, and punishment for infractions of Lord Uvoll’s laws is swift and harsh. The death penalty is exacted for most crimes that elsewhere bring no more than bond servitude or prison time.

###### Communitites

Within the lands of this evil nobleman six villages totaling around 1,500 to 1,800 inhabitants. Of the total thorps population, 10% can be levied for military service. The following list provides the names for these thorps.

There is a village for every four manors held. As noted, however, Lord Uvoll’s castle is adjacent to the small town community he also owns, that being detailed above. A village will be on a watercourse or else have a deep well. Each village consists of about 40 buildings plus a religious structure, a large shrine or a fane. The average population for such a community is 250 to 300 persons. Each villain has hidden somewhere in his cottage a cache of coins with a value of from 1-20sp. Village officials and tradesmen will have a cache of 10 times that amount.

The main part of the village consists of two opposite rows of 16 stone cottages for the villains with each row separated into half, so that eight families working aUse the information provided at the beginning of this section and that in Appendix A, Developing Yggsburgh, Communities of Yggsburgh to further develop this area. section of the manor are adjacent. There are separate and larger cottages for the reeve, cowherd, hayward, shepherd, swineherd, and woodward. Two buildings of somewhat larger size will be rented by freemen, one an ale house or tavern the other a smith or general merchant. Each of the row houses will have a tool shed and a garden behind it. Further back are four commonly used barns for large livestock and feed, as well as various wooden houses, sheds, and coups for farm equipment and smaller animals. At one end of the street between these structures will be the village fane in which the cleric dwells and holds services. The grounds around the fane will be lawn and gardens of no great extent. Behind it is the local burial ground.

The clerics in such villages will all be of evil alignment and around 4th level.

###### Thorps

There are only 10 thorps on the lands of Lord Uvoll. These are little communities of freemen, generally farmers, with dwellings only, they being too small to support any commercial shop. Each has a less than a score of houses with barns and outbuildings, and an average population of 120 persons. A small shrine with a non- combatant low-level evil priest serving as spiritual “guide” for the folk of the thorp is the norm. The follwoing lists the names of the ten thorps.

The economy of the community is based on agriculture and herding. It might be that the hamlet’s residents also make some excellent hand-crafted items (for example leather armor or even silver jewelry set with locally found moss agates) that the characters might trade for and sell at a considerable profit in Yggsburgh.

Each head of a household in this hamlet has a purse with 15sp-6gp per level or hit dice, on his or her person. Within each house is a hidden cache of 25-100gp in various coin and valuable items and five times that sum if the place is a business or shrine.

#### Villages of the South Pastures

**Location: South Pastures

**Name **and **Type: See below

**Adventure **References: 34. Traitors in Our Midst

**Encounters: Thorp or Hamlet Green Events

This section details those villages found in the South Pastures. The South Pasture covers 180 square miles and belongs to the Free Town of Yggsburgh. The west portion is not shown on the map. As the name implies, this is an agricultural area, and there are many farms here raising cattle, sheep, and horses as well as feed crops.

Typically, there are four freehold or socman farmers in a group with their lands covering one square mile. Their buildings are clustered together for intercourse and mutual aid. Each farm is about 160 acres in extent, 40 of which is a woodlot, and of the remaining 120 acres, 30 is cultivated, 70 is in meadow (hay) and pasture and 20 is covered by buildings and pens, home gardens, lanes, hedges and fences, water features and non-arable land.

Where there are manorial lands, farms are about half the extent of those of freeholders, and eight families are found in a square mile. In such cases, meadow, pasture, and woodland will be in larger tracts, and the woodland will likely be contiguous and used by a lord for hunting.

There are two knights dwelling in fortified manor houses in this area. Sir Anthony Belvoir and Sir Wade Fulgent. Each have 10 manors and 2 villages under their control. Thus, in all, these two knights have fiefs covering 20 square miles. In each holding, all of the manors (a square mile of 640 acres) are adjacent, not separated by non-manorial land. Sir Anthony Belvoir and Sir Wade Fulgent are detailed in Appendix I, Orders of Battle, Knights of Yggsburgh. The troops both Sir Anthony, Sir Wade and the Lord Mayor of Yggsburgh can draw from the South Pastures are detailed in the the same appendix but under The South Pastures entry.

Sir Anthony Belvoir resides in his manner (C5) and has two villages under his control, Meadowspring (V15) and Belvoirton (V16). Sir Wade Fulgent resides in his manner (C6) and has two villages under his control, Fulgentstead (V17) and Oldfield (V18).

###### Villages

Each of the villages in the South Pastures are located on a watercourse or else have a deep well. Each village consists of about 40 buildings and all have a religious structure, a large shrine or fane. The average population for these communities is 250-300 persons. So within the South Pastures area there are four villages totaling around 1,000 to 1,200 inhabitants total. The lord’s manor house is adjacent to one of these villages.

The main part of the villages consists of two opposite rows of 16 stone cottages for the villains. Each row is separated into two parts so that eight families work a single section of the manor. There are separate and larger cottages for the reeve, cowherd, hayward, shepherd, swineherd, and woodward. One to two buildings of somewhat larger size are rented by freemen. One being an ale house or tavern while the other is a smith or general merchant.


Each of the row houses has a tool shed and a garden behind it. Further back are four commonly used barns for large livestock and feed, as well as various wooden houses, sheds, and coups for farm equipment and smaller animals. At one end of the street between these structures is the village fane in which the town’s religious leader dwells and holds services. The grounds around the fane are lawn and gardens but of no great extent. Behind this is the local burial ground.

Each villain has hidden somewhere in his cottage a cache of coins with a value of from 1-100sp. Village officials and tradesmen have a cache of 10 times that amount.

###### General Store

The general store carries the usual goods, all from demi-human peddlers and sized for halflings. The proprietor is Jessip Littler. See the Merchant’s Items list at the beginning of this section for a list of goods and costs for the general store’s items (page 106).

###### Smithy

This is a full-fledged smithy where smithing is carried on by Reber Holman. He is also the community’s chief man. He is able to do all common work from tool and horseshoe making to sharpening of edges. See the Blacksmith’s Items list at the beginning of this section for a list of goods and costs for the items at the smithy (page 106).

###### Taverns

Each village has a tavern. Some possible names include: Axe & Stump, Coach & Four, Sow & Sounders, The Blue Lantern and The Black Swan. When the party is at the tavern be sure to consult the Small Tavern Common Room and Outside the Small Tavern Events tables (see page 105).

###### Thorps

There are several thorps located throughout the area. These are little communities with only a few dwellings. Each of the two has less than a score of houses with barns and outbuildings and an average population of 120 persons. Each also has a small shrine with a spiritual guide for the folk living nearby.

In a thorp, each adult has a purse with 1-3gp worth of various coin on his or her person. Each house has a cache of 5-50gp in various coin, items or jewelry. Each shrine has five times that amount.

can wait, be served food and cider or buttermilk to drink by the owner’s wife and children. All fare is ordinary but inexpensive at 2sp per person, 5cp for a pint of drink.

It is not an actual ford, however, although daring horsemen can swim their mounts across at this calm and relatively narrow (150 feet width) stretch of water. The main means of crossing is a large raft that ferries vehicles, animals, and men from one side of the river to the other. The fee is 5cp per person.

#### Villages of the Westfields

**Location: Westfields

**Adventure **Reference: 29. The Drumbeat of War

**Name **and **Type: See Below

**Encounters:** Thorp or Hamlet Green Events

The Westfields comprise that fertile plane north of the River Nemo. As the name implies, this is an agricultural area, and there are within it many farms.

Typically, there are four freehold or socman farmers in a group with their lands covering one square mile. Their buildings are clustered together for intercourse and mutual aid. Each farm is about 160 acres in extent, 40 of which is a woodlot, and of the remaining 120 acres, 30 is cultivated, 70 is in meadow (hay) and pasture and 20 is covered by buildings and pens, home gardens, lanes, hedges and fences, water features and non-arable land.

Where there are manorial lands, farms are about half the extent of those of freeholders, and eight families are found in a square mile. In such cases, meadow, pasture, and woodland will be in larger tracts, and the woodland will likely be contiguous and used by a lord for hunting.

There are four knights dwelling in fortified manor houses in this area, each with such villages (clusters of houses for villains) on their manors. Sir Donald Kark and Sir Charles Thornly each own 12 manors and 3 villages. Sir Reynard Montjoy and Sir Bertram Trillingby each own 8 manors and 2 villages. Thus in all these four knights have fiefs covering 40 square miles. In each holding, all of the manors (a square mile of 640 acres) are adjacent, not separated by non-manorial land. The troops available to the Knights and the general levy of the Westfields can be found in Appendix I, Orders of Battle, Levy of the Westfields.

Sir Donald Kark resides in a manor (C1) with Redmede (V5), Riverfield (V6) and Karkesteade (V7) in his domains. Sir Charles Thornly resides in a manor (C2) with Thornlyton (V8), Flowerfarm (V9) and Goodspring (V10) in his domains. Sir Reynard Montjoy resides in a manor (C3) with Orchardton (V11) and Montjoyville (V12) in his domains. Sir Bertram Trillingby resides in a manor (C4) with Trillington (V13) and Beeley (V14) in his domains.

###### Villages

Each of the villages in the South Pastures are located on a watercourse or else have a deep well. Each village consists of about 40 buildings and all have a religious structure, a large shrine or fane. The average population for these communities is 250-300


persons. So within the South Pastures area there are four villages totaling around 1,000 to 1,200 inhabitants total. The lord’s manor house is adjacent to one of these villages.

The main part of the villages consists of two opposite rows of 16 stone cottages for the villains. Each row is separated into two parts so that eight families work a single section of the manor. There are separate and larger cottages for the reeve, cowherd, hayward, shepherd, swineherd, and woodward. One to two buildings of somewhat larger size are rented by freemen. One being an ale house or tavern while the other is a smith or general merchant. Each of the row houses has a tool shed and a garden behind it. Further back are four commonly used barns for large livestock and feed, as well as various wooden houses, sheds, and coups for farm equipment and smaller animals. At one end of the street between these structures is the village fane in which the town’s religious leader dwells and holds services. The grounds around the fane are of no great extent. Behind this is the local burial ground.

Each villain has hidden somewhere in his cottage a cache of coins with a value of from 1-100sp. Village officials and tradesmen have a cache of 10 times that amount.

This is a full-fledged smithy where smithing is carried on by Reber Holman. He is also the community’s chief man. He is able to do all common work from tool and horseshoe making to sharpening of edges. See the Blacksmith’s Items list at the beginning of this section for a list of goods and costs for the items at the smithy (page 106).

###### Taverns

Each village has a tavern. Some possible names include: Blue Moon, Drake & Ducks, Fox & Hare, The Green Archer, The Plowman, The Red Stag and The Well. When the party is at the tavern be sure to consult the Small Tavern Common Room and Outside the Small Tavern Events tables (see page 105).

###### Thorps

There are several thorps located throughout the area. These are little communities with only a few dwellings. Each of the two has less than a score of houses with barns and outbuildings and an average population of 120 persons. Each also has a small shrine with a spiritual guide for the folk living nearby.

In a thorp or village each adult has a purse with 1-3gp worth of various coin on his or her person. Each house has a cache of 5- 50gp in various coin, items or jewelry. Each shrine has five times that amount, including luggage, or small animal such as a goat, pig, or sheep, 10cp for a large animal such as a cow or horse, and 15cp for each wheel of a vehicle, carts thus costing 2sp, with carriages, coaches, and wagons 5sp to carry across the river. People and goods within a vehicle are carried at no extra charge, but a rider who stays mounted is still charged the 5cp toll.

#### 2: Castle Zagyg

As any character approaches the vicinity of the abandoned castle all that will be seen is a swirling fog covering the area in which the structure lies. No magic can dispel the cloaking cover, for until the proper material is available, there is simply nothing but bare rock covered by fog to be discovered.

See also Yggsburgh Environs, Encounter 38: Frogs and Fogs. This location will be detailed in upcoming installments of the Castle Zagyg series. There should be ample other adventures to keep any party busy until such time.

#### 3: Garham

###### Adventure Reference:

**Location: Big Fish Lake

**Type: Village

**Encounters: Thorp or Hamlet Green Events Table

###### Population: **250**

Garham is a small fishing hamlet located on the banks of Bigfish Lake, about 35 miles distant by road or water from Yggsburgh. It is independent of Yggsburgh and ready to defend that privilege by war, if threatened. Although small, it is the source of much activity. Many adventures can begin here, or characters may gain information about the surrounding lands. Garham has, roughly, a population of 250 people, with farmers and fishermen making up the bulk of the inhabitants. There are also other business in Garham, which are detailed below.

Fishing consumes much of the efforts of Garham’s people. For the most part it is done by net, running line and hooks as well as pole and line. Some of the inhabitants use baited traps to catch giant crayfish, aiming mainly for the small, lobster-sized ones. Catches are sent downriver daily to Yggsburgh in one of three big barges owned by the town’s Fishmongers’ Guild (these having holds that are magically enchanted to be nearly freezing cold). This run down the River Nemo takes only six hours, but the upstream return takes three times as long.

Most of the buildings in the community are set on fieldstone foundations and made of timber and plaster or boards. Unless otherwise detailed, assume a structure is made thus. The traffic routes are dirt, although Lakeham Lane is crowned and has side ditches. The buildings on the east side of the river are part of the community. They are reached by ferry without charge, although strangers wishing to cross are asked for a nominal toll of 5cp per person, 3sp for a mount. The locations shown on the map are described below.

Garham is able to call upon a sizable array of forces in time of conflict. Refer to Appendix I, Orders of Battle Appendix, Garham for details on the militia.

###### The Environs of Yggsburgh

Each family dwelling in the community has a hidden cache of 15- 150gp in various coin and valuable objects located in the house. Commercial buildings have five times that amount hidden in their place of business. Each adult carries 3-12gp in various coin on them. One of the fishermen (Castle Keeper’s discretion) owns a large magical net of capturing.

There are 27 fishing boats owned by various fishermen in the community. They are from 22 to 30 feet in length and have a beam of 6 to 9 feet. There are also 13 smaller rowboats in the community. These are between 8 and 11 feet in length and have a 3 to 4 foot beam. These all break down as follows:

Sailed and oared fishing boats:

1 x 30’ x 9’

3 x 28’ x 8’

5 x 26’ x 7’

12 x 24’ x 6.5’

7 x 22’ x 6’

Rowboats with small sail that can be rigged: 2 x 11’ x 4’

5 x 10’ x 3.5’

7 x 9’ x 3’

3 x 8’ x 3’

###### Adventure Hooks

1. There is a monstrous catfish that has upset several fishing boats and killed three local fishermen in the process. Will the adventurers dare to go aboard a boat and see if they can be instrumental in killing this monster? (See Bigfish Lake in the Geography Section.)

Giant Catfish _(This _creature’s _eital _stats _are: _HD _10d10, _HP _75,_ _AC _13. _Its _prime _attributes _are: _physical. _It _attacks _with _a _bite _that delieers 2-8+10 damage, aud two mouth feelers that delieer 1-4 damage. _The _feelers _also _delieer _a _poisou _that _causes _1-10 _extra_ _damage uuless a saee is made, iu which case they delieer half that_ _amouut.)_

One of the young fishermen has found a bed of giant lake clams. It is in a shallow area, only 30 feet deep. Will the strangers assist him in getting these bivalves? He will gladly give them half of all the freshwater pearls found thus, and the shells themselves are worth about 25sp apiece.

1. A very rough band of wanderers has come into the village, and are getting drunk in the Jolly Fisherman Ale House. They are talking about “doing some killing, looting and raping in this stinking little thorp!” There are only 12 of them, but they seem to be most dangerous. Will the team of adventurers be moved to step up and stop these villains?

The band of ne’er-do-wells is led by Dirty George. With him are a deranged dwarf, Raving Reginar, the main spy and finger- man for the gang, “Money-finder” Wildbrook, and the half-orc, “Kickaround” Jerunk, who is the gang’s main instigator of trouble. Several thugs accompany these troublemakers.

If the party is interested in Mound Isle, one of the young fishermen will convey them there for a price. He charges 25gp for the trip (and 10gp a day for the wait, if the characters choose to have him wait for them).

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

1. A lone boatman comes into the hamlet with terrible news. A large band of rampaging humanoids is coming down the East Hill Road. They will surely attack Garham tomorrow, when they come out of the wooded hills and see the community. What can the party do to stop these killers and protect the folk? Below is a suggestion for a band of kobolds, and one of hobgoblins, but the Castle Keeper should determine the final type and number of humanoids to adequately challenge the party.

disappearances and horrible murders in their scattered settlements. Will the party venture forth to find out who or what is responsible and eliminate the dire threat? All that is known is that the killer or killers are some sort of monsters that come by night and are unseen. It is left in the able hands of the Castle Keeper to devise just what sort of creature or creatures are involved in this encounter; however, a small band of bugbear cannibals might be the cause of the trouble.

#### Mound Island


**Location: Mound Island in Bigfish Lake

**Encounter **Chart: Lake Encounters

**Zagyg Adventure Reference: Big Fish Lake, Garham

The characters will undoubtedly learn that Mound Isle has a bad reputation. Fishermen will not ply their trade near to it, and only a few young and daring folk so much as set foot on the island during daylight hours. It is well known that there are dangerous things dwelling there. Tales of rash and foolhardy treasure hunters who ventured to Mount Isle to find the River King’s Tomb and loot it, never to be seen again, are commonly told in many places—the town proper and in the taverns and inns of smaller communities around it.

###### Mound Island

This island is about one and a half miles long and a quarter of a mile across. It has rocky shores that rise from seven to 12 feet above the water surrounding it, and there are only two places on the isle to beach a boat. The main area is at its western (downstream) end where the land is lowest. Here, there is a V-shaped beach of large pebbles and small boulders that is about 50 yards deep and 100 yards across where it meets the treeline of the island to the east. There, the bedrock of Mound Isle is inclined and only about one to two feet above the beach, so moving from the open beach to the island interior is easy. There is also a small cove on south shore, it being about a third of a mile from its east end (upstream) end. The cove is half-moon shaped, 100 feet across and indents the shoreline about 50 feet. Its center portion has a muddy beach some 40 feet long, this giving onto a shallow ravine running inland, northwards up to the spine of the central ridge. In heavy rain the ravine is flooded, and anyone cought in it will likely by swept under the torrent and drowned.

The whole island is thickly overgrown by trees. At its shore there is a profusion of smaller foliage—grass, weeds, small shrubs, bushes, and small varieties of trees ringing the central woods. The island has at its center a long ridge with a rounded crest, and the trees grow up its sides and atop this prominence, save in a few places where formations of bare rock jut out. Because of the heavy vegetation and rough ground, movement on the island is slow and difficult. It takes three hours or more from move from one end to the other, and nearly an hour to cross its breadth because of the central spine.

###### History

This is what they will discover in their research regarding Mound Isle and the River King.

Three centuries before the lands here were civilized, a number of fierce and barbaric tribes dwelled in this region. The most powerful and feared of these tribes was called the Cnobrii, and their lands encompassed most of the territory that surrounds Yggsburgh. The Cnobrii were able river sailors, and used the Nemo and other streams to carry their warriors far and wide to raid and plunder. Their last and greatest chief styled himself as ‘the River King.” His actual name is lost to history, but his wealth and cruelty are legendary. The treasure he amassed by his cruel raiding made rivals mount campaigns against the Cnobrii, so the wealth brought no peace or prosperity to him and his people. Although many of the slaves captured by the tribe were sacrificed to a malign deity their great chief honored, the bloodshed was to no avail, and in time the loss of Cnobrii warriors was such that the tribe was near extinction. In desperation, the River King and the last of his folk made Mound Isle a fortress, and there is it said they constructed a place for performing the darkest of evil rites to evoke demonic aid. At the last battle the River King took all of his hoard of wealth, and with the whole of the tribe entombed themselves in this subterranean place. Those foes who attempted to enter after the Cnobrii were thrown back, and then great rocks closed the entrance. Thus ended the dreaded Cnobrii tribe and their terrible ruler.

No search since has discovered the location of the so-called tomb, although many expeditions have searched for it on

Mound Isle. Few of those so engaged have lived to tell of their undertaking. It seems that some curse is active in that place, and surely some fell guardian or guardians are active in keeping the buried place inviolate. As the treasure buried there is beyond imagination, there are still occasional forays onto the island by treasure hunters, the last known one conducted only a year before this entry was written. Of the 50 persons involved, three returned to Yggsburgh. They were discovered floating down the river in a rowboat. All died within a few days of their rescue. The only words spoken by the strongest of the three, a ranger, were as follows:

_“(Moaning in semi-conscious nightmare recollection)_ _‘The shadows are alive! They hide things worse than _they _are, _lads—retreat! _If _they _catch _us _we _are doomed… _Gods, _the _dead _ones _can _follow _us _into _the sunlight. _There’s _no _hope. _Every _man _for _himself_

###### Yggsburgh Library

The following what character’s will discover in their research regarding Mound Isle and the River King in the Natural History Section of the Yggsburgh Library.

_“There is said to be a most unusual species of Kobold dwelling on Mound Isle. There has been no proof of their existence, but locals claim that these humanoids are especially elusive and dangerous. Supposed encounters with the Kobolds include incidents where they were in the river, swimming like otters, attacked from below without warning. Lacking actual physical evidence, one must conclude that the attacks were actually the work of otters, and strong drink._

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh



_The same can be said for the intelligent raccoons _of Mound Isle, supposedly creatures that use bows and arrows to attack trespassers in the island. No such _species _has _been _discovered _or _even _seen _by a reputable person, so we must conclude this is another tall tale spun for the amusement of the yokels and credulous folk.”_

###### College Library

If the characters have a member able to utilize the College Library, that individual will be able to discover the following information regarding Mound Isle from a student’s paper regarding unusual local fauna.

_Much mystery surrounds Mound Isle. Of interest in regards aberrant local fauna are reports of raccoon-like creatures inhabiting the island. Several verbal reports assert that these unusual raccoons are intelligent tool users with a deadly bent, plying bows to attack and slay any humans_ _who _trespass _upon _their _island. _There _might _be _some_ _correlation _between _the _raccoon _stories _and _claims that an unusual species of Kobolds inhabit Mound Isle. It is unfortunate that the actual facts can not be determined because of the dangers of exploring the island. Whether these perils spring from some ancient _curse _related _to _the _legendary _River _King’s Tomb, aberrant raccoons, humanoid inhabitants, or some combination of these and other factors is immaterial to the dead researcher…”_


###### Mound Island Dungeon

The characters searching for the underground area will need to attain the central portion of the north shore of Mound Isle, then begin exploring inwards some distance to reach the verge of the ridge that runs its length. As this occurs, they will note an area of tumbled rock and stunted trees that enables a clear view of a sheer stone face on the ridge, it being some 300 feet long northeast to southwest, 30 feet high in the central portion, sloping to about 20 feet height at either end. In the central portion there is an area cleared of detritus. This is shown on the map as 1, the entrance to the underground excavation.

For complete statistics of new monsters found herein the Game Master is referred to the Appendix G, Monsters of Yggsburgh. The keys to various dungeon locals and specifics are detailed below.

**S. This is a secret door. Each such hidden panel is a slab of stone that is seven feet high and four feet wide. When its hidden catch is triggered, a push causes it to pivot silently on a corner hinge so as to open or close easily. Unless otherwise indicated, the trigger mechanism is activated by depressing a stone that seems to be a part or the wall. Searching for a secret door in a 10-foot wall section takes 10 rounds time (one minute). Locating the secret foors is a Challenge Level 5 (alternately a simple 1 in 10 chance of discovering it per 10 rounds of checking can be used. In this case, if a character possesses a searching skill, successful use of this skill during one minute of time looking for a secret door increases the chance of discovery to 1 in 2.)

**Passageways: All 10-foot-wide passages have rough-hewn floors and walls, an arched ceiling that is 12 feet above the floor at its apex. The stone is damp and a strange form of lichen grows in scattered patches on the floors, ceilings, and walls of these tunnels at intervals of around 30 feet. This stuff is known as glowlichen and it emits a faint blue light that enables faint vision to a distance of about 10 feet for normal characters, much as the light from a glowstick does. The degenerate pygmies who dwell in these subterranean spaces can see as one would in twilight by its illumination.

**Monster Hit Dice Note:** If the party is of relatively high level, simply increase the hit dice base for the pygmies to 2, 3, or 4, multiplying hit points shown by that number. Leaders are then onehit dice above the remainder of a group.

**Pygmy Bow: This weapon is particular to the degenrate pygmies living in the River King’s Tomb. When using them, the pygmies recieve a +2 to hit. They cause 1-3 points of damage but are also slathered with a poison with a challenge level 2 that cause 2-12 points of damage unless a save versus poison is made, in which case they cause 1-6 points of damage. These bows are suitable for use by halflings or gnomes, but too flimsy for other races to employ.

Each degenerate pygmy warrior has 12 poisoned arrows at the beginning of each encounter, so some unused ones might be recovered if the characters reach the top of the cliff, search for bodies and find them. They possess nothing else of use or value.

1. **Rocky Bluff (described above) The cleared area allows the view of a tunnel opening to broad stairs down running east into the solid rock. Before the entrance are piled bones, skulls, and skeletons—a heap as wide as the way in and about waist high. These are nothing but remains, although the characters will likely expect that they are going to become animated skeletons.

In the foliage at the edge of the cliff above this are concealed six degenerate pygmy warriors armed with short bows and poisoned arrows. These creatures are the inbred descendants of the few Cnobrii that survived the great battle some three centuries back. They are the sentries that guard the entrance to the underground that is sacred to them, their home.

The six are spread out so that no more than three can be affected by a sleep spell. These fanatical little warriors will stay and fight until they or all their enemies are dead. When active above ground, these pygmies wear raccoon skins, so if seen at a glance they appear to be such animals.

Degenerate pygmy sentinels, x6 _(chaotic _eeil, _HD _1, _HP _3, _AC_ _12, PA physical, EQ pygmy bow. Each degeuerate pygmy warrior_ _has 12 poisoued arrows at the begiuuiug of each eucouuter, so_ _some _uuused _oues _might _be _recoeered _if _the _characters _reach_ _the _top _of _the _cliff, _search _for _bodies _aud _fiud _them. _They _possess_ _uothiug _else _of _use _or _ealue.)_

1. **Stone **Block **Wall The passageway here is closed off by a wall of small stone blocks, each about twice the size of a normal brick. Anyone familiar with masonry will note that the mortar holding the stones is old and crumbly. There is a hole of some half-foot square at the left side of the base of the wall. This opening is sufficient for a degenerate pygmy to wiggle through, but small demi-humans will not be likely able to pass unless they are slender and not taller than three feet. Of course, the wall can be broken down by proper tools or blunt weapons, but the noise of this activity will bring pygmy warriors from areas 3, 7, and 12-13.

Any pygmy arriving at a position behind the intruders will wait until they break down the barrier, then attack so as to get the enemy in a crossfire coming from their comrades on the other side of the broken wall and their own archery.

1. **Chamber This 30’ x 30’ Chamber has a 15’ ceiling and patches of glowlichen in it. There is a contingent of degenerate pygmy guards here as well.

Degenerate pygmy guards, x10 _(chaotic _eeil, _HD _1d6, _HP _4x5_ _aud_ _3x5,_ _AC_ _12,_ _PA_ _physical,_ _EQ_ _pygmy_ _bow._ _They_ _possess uothiug _else _of _use _or _ealue.)_

There are 12 small pallets and piles of cloth and animal skins in this place. Six are along the north wall and six are along the south wall. In each are concealed a mix of coins: 5d4cp, 3d4sp, 2d4gp.

###### The Environs of Yggsburgh

If these guards see intruders approaching along the passageway, they will conceal themselves to either side of the entrance to their chamber and attack as soon as any target enters the place. If they hear the noise of a blocking wall (area 2) being torn down, they will leave their post to attack those tearing it down.

1. **Pillared **Forecourt This is a 30’ x 20’ pillared forecourt in an underground temple area of 50’ x 120’ in size. It has a 25’ ceiling arch and patches of glowlichen in it. Centered in this area is a 12- foot-tall statue of a hideous demon lord. The figure is carved from red sandstone, its gaping mouth set with actual teeth taken from a bear, tushes from a boar and with its eyes of glittering green quartz stones the size of a child’s fist. The demon stands spraddle-legged, arms opened wide as if about to embrace someone in a horrible hug. It also radiates magic.

If the area around it is entered, the shadows in the alcoves behind it are released. Furthermore, if it is touched in any way, including magical attack, a summoning is triggered, and a Hezrou demon is gated into area 6 and loosed from there so as to be able to roam anywhere in the complex.

The statue is otherwise inactive, nothing but inanimate stone, although at one time it was an active fetish that summoned forth the demon lord it depicts. The quartz “eyes” in its head are worth only 25gp each. If the statue’s head is removed, teeth and eyes left intact, the location from which it was recovered documented, the value of this artifact to the Yggsburgh Museum is 25,000- 50,000gp.

1. **Alcoves These are 20’ x 20’ alcoves. Pygmy shadows lurk here and will be released when any intruder enters area 4 or this area. Once loosed, the shadows will actively seek out and attack intruders, ignoring pygmies.

Pygmy Shadow x4 _(chaotic _eeil, _HD _3d8, _HP _16, _AC _13, _PA_ _physical, _ATTK _+3 _chill _touch _for _2-5 _damage. _Additioually,_ _the _eictim _loses _1 _poiut _of _streugth _for _20-80 _rouuds. _If _a _eictim _is brought to 0 streugth, they become a shadow.)_

In each alcove there are four black agates of egg-size, cabochon cut. Each is incised with a sigil that draws one of the shadows confined here to it after that undead creature has been away for more than one hour. If one of these stones is shattered by a powerful blow, the shadow attuned to it is destroyed. As gems they are worth 5gp, but as artifacts, each is worth 50-200gp to a collector or a museum.

The characters lack the magical capacity to attune a shadow to one of these stones so one can not use it to control a shadow. But if one is picked up and carried away, and its shadow is not destroyed, that undead monster will be drawn to the location of the agate, attacking any living creatures in its vicinity.

1. **Pillared Altar This is a 30’ x 20’ chamber in an underground temple area of 50’ x 120’ with a 25’ ceiling arch. Patches of glowlichen grow along the walls. Heaped on a stone block of eight-foot length, four feet width and height are a mass of ancient treasures. This hoard consists the following:

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

**1 **gold **coffer filled with 1,247 precious gems of 20 and more carat size—diamonds, emeralds, rubies, sapphires of all colors, pearls, opals—of inestimable worth

**1 ivory box** filled with 138 pieces of gold jewelry set with precious stones—these items of inestimable worth

**1 barbaric gold crown** set with large green garnets worth 22,000gp for relic value

**5,000 **gold coins worth 150gp each for relic value

**12 **silver **drinking **cups worth 150gp each for relic value

**20,000 **bronze **coins worth 5gp each for relic value **1 **bronze **breastplate worth 5,000gp for relic value **1 bronze sword** worth 1,700gp for relic value

Unless previously brought in, as soon as any intruder enters the area a Hezrou demon linked to the area is gated in, materializes, and attacks.

Hezrou _(chaotic _eeil, _HD _9d8, _HP _45, _AC _23, _PA _physical _aud_ _meutal, _ATTK _two _claws _for _1d3 _+9 _damage _aud _a _bite _for _4d4_

The demon generally prefers physical attacks so as to enjoy the sight of its victims being harmed, and will resort to use of magical powers only if it is suffering damage over 20% of its normal total.

When the demon is slain, a demonic magic on the altar stone is triggered. This brings forth a blazing fire from the stone, consuming it and all upon it in 10 rounds. Any living thing within 10 feet of the conflagration suffers 9d6 damage per round of exposure. In short, the treasure atop the altar will not be gained by the party no matter what, but in most cases they will be aware of its loss and most displeased.

1. **Chamber** This is a 30’ x 100’ underground hall, with a 25’ ceiling arch, a 20’ x 10’ antechamber area with a 15’ ceiling, and glowlichen growth on ceiling and most of the walls.

This is where the pygmy community has its main dwelling. The 20’ x 10’ alcove at the west end of the main chamber has a huge fireplace (10’ wide, 6’ high and deep) set into its west wall. This is where the debased little creatures prepare and cook food.


There are fish fillets being smoked above a low fire, and a great iron cauldron hung on chains from an arm that swings in an arc outwards from the right side of the fireplace. It is simmering too. A stool and a table enable the pygmy cooks to reach the great pot. Into this pot go most of the foodstuffs brought in by the pygmies, vegetable or meat, including the flesh of humans, demi-humans, or humanoids. Only some animals and giant crawfish are cooked whole while animals are spitted and roasted, crawfish broiled on an iron grill if too large to force into the cauldron. Firewood is stacked against the north wall of this alcove. There are various knives, cleavers, spits and like utensils hung on the walls or laying around on the floor.

The main place is littered with their sleeping pallets, most being arranged in the huge shells of giant clams or snapping turtles. There is much miscellaneous personal gear (woven baskets, gourds, etc.), and various foodstuffs (dried fish and meat, some roots and berries in skin bags, woven baskets and big clam shells containers). There are 30 non-combatant juvenile pygmies here in addition to the male and female warriors. These young pygmies will have in their possession 12 large freshwater pearls, all badly chipped and valueless.

The is a shaman also. He has a small skin “medicine bag” around his neck. It contains bones and teeth from undead creatures (see below for effects).

When hearing intruders breaking down the stone barrier in the tunnel, ten pygmy warriors and one chief will hasten forth to attack the enemy, as another like force stays back the angle of the passage, their numbers strung out so that the last is in the antechamber area to relay information to the chief and the others in the main area. If the intruders beat the attacking force of pygmies, these warriors hold the passageway, while the shaman opens the secret door to areas 8 and 9, summons forth the inhabitants who arrive 10 rounds after they are called.

The shaman needs no spell books, but behind the secret door to area 10 in the east wall he keeps a small wicker hamper. In this container he has four pots of poison (2d6 per application) that have sufficient substance to apply to 36 weapons each. He makes up the poison on a regular basis, as it loses its potency after one month. To gain the main ingredient, the shaman must be underwater for an extended period of time gathering slime from the underground “lake” in areas 14-19. Thus there is a gourd flask in the hamper that contains a concentrated water breathing potion, the eight ounces of fluid it contains are sufficient to enable eight persons to breath normally when underwater for up to two hours of time each.

1. **Burial Vault** This room has a 50’ x 20’ front area with a 20’ ceiling arch and patches of glowlichen growing in it. There are four stone sarcophagi here, two to either side of the entry passage. The mummy warriors within them will arise and attack intruders if the pygmy shaman has not already summoned them forth. As these animated remains are protectors of the ancient Cnobrii tribe, they will fight for their degenerate little descendants, against any intruders that threaten them.

These corpses are the remains of the River King’s four chief warriors. They are clad in ancient bronze armor, and each wears a necklace from which depends a turquoise amulet.

1. **Burial **Chamber This chamber has a 50’ x 20’ rear area and 20’ ceiling arch with patches of glowlichen growing all about. There is a single stone sarcophagus here in the center of the space. The mummy shaman within it will arise and attack intruders if the pygmy shaman has not already summoned it forth. This corpse is the remains of the River King’s head priest. It is clad in ancient robes, and wears a necklace from which depends a turquoise amulet.

1. **Natural **Cave This chamber is around 60’ in radius with a 30’ ceiling apex and patches of glowlichen growing on the walls. This grotto has many stalactites depending from its roof and stalagmites on its floor. Some of the latter have strange shapes and will seem threateningly like monsters when viewed from a distance of 20 or more feet and dim light. There are a number of harmless bats roosting on the ceiling, these entering and leaving the cave via a small chimney that opens on an angle to the northeast in the northeast wall.

In the west alcove in the south of the grotto, shielded by stalagmites and a column, is a smaller version of the statue of the demon seen in area 4. This one is three feet tall, sculpted from red agate, with eyes of green garnet. Its pose is standing straight, with arms at its sides, forearms folded in front to meet with hands palm up and cupped so as to accept offerings. If any offering is actually places in the cupped hands, this awakens the sleeping wretch wight in the pool (are 11 below) and it will then attack in 2 rounds after the offering is so placed.

The statue is otherwise inactive, nothing but inanimate stone, although at one time it too was an active fetish that summoned forth the demon lord it depicts. The green garnet “eyes” in its head are worth 250gp each. If the statue is removed intact, the location from which it was recovered and documented, the value of this artifact to the Yggsburgh Museum is 12,000-50,000gp.

1. **Chamber There is a 30’ long, 12’ wide, 25’ deep water pool in here. The water level is about a foot lower than the floor of the grotto in which it lies. This cold pool of water is the cursed “resting place” of the ancient River King. In making a bargain with the unnamed demon lord, the River King was tricked. The end result is that when his power was broken, the demon turned him into a wretch wight, cursed to endless un-life. Most of which must be spent in the chill depths of this pool.

At least once a year, more often if there is a sacrificial victim available, his degenerate pygmy descendants are lead by their shaman to this place. They bring a captive with them and the shaman places a drop of blood in the demon statues cupped hands. The undead River King then emerges from his pool and drains the sacrificial victim of its life energy. Thereafter the pygmies pay homage to their undead lord, he returns to his cold “resting place,” and the tribe returns to their places above.

If any person touches the water of this pool, the undead River King is awakened just as if an offering had been placed in the demon statue’s hands. He rises and surfaces in two rounds, leaping from the pool to the stone floor at its edge in the second round. This results in surprise for the characters party unless someone able to see into the dark depths was watching and saw the monster rising.

Wretch wight _(chaotic _eeil, _HD _5d10, _HP _40, _AC _15, _PA_ _physical, EQ +1 great battle axe that delieers 7-13 damage aud_ _au aucieut gold buckle set with four large alexaudrite gems ealued _at _100gp _plus _each _gems _ealue _of _300gp _which, _as _a _museum artifact _is _ealued _at _2,000-8,000gp.. _Special: _Wights _cau _draiu euergy _leeel with a touch.)_

In its sarcophagus at the bottom of the pool are a gold crown with jewels worth 25,000gp total (triple that to a collector or a museum) and a +1 round shield.

1. **Landing** This is a 10’ x 10’ staircase upper landing with a 12’ ceiling and patches of glowlichen growing on the walls. Four degenerate pygmy stands guard here. If these guards hear the noise of a blocking wall (location 2) being torn down they will whistle down the staircase to alert their fellows, then leave their post to attack those tearing it down.

They have nothing of value other than their weapons.

1. **Landing This is a 20’ x 10’ lower landing for a staircase lower landing with a 12’ ceiling and patches of glowlichen growing on the walls. Eight degenerate pygmy guards are here. If these guards hear a warning call from above they leave their post to go up and attack intruders in their complex.

They have nothing of value other than their weapons. There is a rack of 12 small tridents with four-foot-long shafts. These deliver 1d3 damage as a weapon, plus poison applied to the small tines, that inflicting 2d4 damage per tine, and eight fishing nets hanging from pegs on the wall opposite the trident rack.

1. **Small Underground Lake The main body of the water (14) is about 180’ wide to the east, 90’ across north to south, and from 20’ to 70’ deep. It is fed from underground springs and flows out to the River Nemo through area 19. This is where the degenerate pygmies do fish “farming.”

In the water at the edge of area 13 are what appear to be six small floats like those used for seine nets. Each is about three inches in diameter, made of a light wood, covered with some form of wax to keep water from soaking into it. The floats are caught in a small purse seine net (where they were left by pygmies who heard intruders, so hastened from their pending fishing duties). When one is picked up and held tightly the enchantment placed upon it causes the wooden sphere to glow, gradually brightening each round from a light as dim as a 10 watt electric bulb, to 25, then 40, then 60, then 100, and finally as bright as a 150 watt light bulb.


These are the lures the degenerate pygmies use when netting or spearing fish. They are also used to lure fish from the river into area 19 and beyond into the main body of water here.

Also moored to the ledge by woven ropes are six little canoes, each made from a hollowed out log. A canoe of this sort, 6’ long, 2’ wide, and 1.5’ high from keel to side can carry as many as six pygmies, but one man-sized occupant is the maximum for adventurers. There is a pair of small paddles in the bottom of each canoe and also a pair of coiled lines 30’ long with hooks on each end for securing and bringing in large fish that can not be tossed into the bottom of the craft after netting or spearing.

At the bottom of the water, in area 14, there are a dozen great sturgeon and as many garfish of 20-foot size, above them at around 55’ depth are huge bass and pickerel of five-foot and length, and at 40’ to 20’ depth are the great panfish of the river—red sunfish, platter crappie, and golden perch of two-foot and more length that weigh six or more pounds. Eels of 10’ and more length swim around the edges of the lake at various depths. Smaller fish and minnows abound, attracted to the subterranean pool by the lights. Fed by the scraps tossed into the water by the pygmies, they in turn keep the larger fish here until they are harvested with nets or poisoned spears by the diminutive fishers. Even the garfish will be attracted by the light of a glowing sphere.

Be aware that areas 15 through 18 are closed off by nets from the main body of water.

1. **Side **Pool This pool is 20’ x 40’ size. The closing net is held up on ropes fastened to metal rings on either side of the entrance, so that it is about one foot above the water surface. It can be lowered by slacking the ropes or dropped loose by allowing the ends to run free from the rings.

As this area is shallower than the lake, being only 30’ deep, the pygmies net and place catfish in it, feed them fish orts and animals taken and not eaten such as rats, harvesting them for special feasts. There are about 12 catfish here, the largest being nine feet long, the smallest five feet in length. The largest one will attack and attempt to swallow any demi-human swimming near it.

At the bottom of this area, in the center where there is a hollow of about six feet diameter is a stone the size of melon. It glows a dull red in the blackness of the water, and it feels hot to the touch. It is a magically energized object that sheds warmth in a 12-foot radius. As it rests on the bottom, the stone beneath and around it is warm also, so that the water temperature in this area is around 60 degrees F. If the stone is taken by any characters, it weighs 10 pounds, has a six-inch diameter, and its radiant heat is a constant 80 degrees in its area of effect. Water movement lowers the surrounding temperature, as will air movement if out of water. However, in a relatively small enclosed space, it will serve as an excellent heater.

1. **Side **Pool This pool is 20’ x 40’ in size. The closing net is held up on ropes fastened to metal rings on either side of the entrance, so that it is about one foot above the water surface. It can be lowered by slacking the ropes or dropped loose by allowing the ends to run free from the rings.

The pygmies have captured and confined in this place six of their race who have become aquatic ghouls, survivors of an attack by a lacedon. When the shaman detected their being infected by ghoul fever, he had them placed herein so serve as guardians for “sacred items.” These monsters are fed corpses of the dead pygmies, other human, demi-human, and humanoid victims slain by the diminutive savages. These pygmy lacedons will attack anyone not a pygmy who enters their area, or loses the net and frees them.

Their pool area has a bottom of 40’ depth and thereon rests a bronze chest with an interior capacity of two cubic feet. The chest has a hidden catch that opens it, that stuff having a poisoned needle trap that delivers 4d6 damage immediately to the one triggering it. It is bypassed by using a small metal object such as a dagger point to depress it. Inside the chest are: 2,000gp in mixed coins, a few gold and copper, but mainly silver, 3,700gp in uncut garnet and quartz gem crystals, 2 potions of extra healing and a waterproof wand case with a wand of magic missiles inside with 16 charges on it.

It can be lowered by slacking the ropes or dropped loose by allowing the ends to run free from the rings.

The pygmies keep huge snapping turtles penned in here as the water is only about 10’ deep and there are ledges above the water on the south side of the cavity where the turtles can climb out of the water. They consider taking one of these dangerous animals a test of bravery for a warrior, and of course find one of the turtles an excellent meal with three flavors of flesh—fish, chicken, and beef.

On the bottom of the pool area is a skeleton of an adventurer who swam into the lake, blundered into this area, climbing over the net thinking to hide from the pygmies who had detected him, only to be attacked and devoured by the turtles. Amidst the scattered bones of this poor fellow will be detected the gleam of gold, for he wore a ring of swimming.

In this area the pygmies pen in huge crayfish for their dining pleasure. As a matter of fact most people love to eat these crustaceans, and if the team is able to bring some back to

There is no question that these crustaceans will attack characters near them, as they will be perceived as edible prey. The pygmies lure one out with bait, ensnare it in a net, and drag it out of the water alive to be cooked, or killed and eaten raw.

1. **Forepool This is a chamber of 40 foot by 40 foot circumference size leading to an underground channel of the River Nemo. Glowlichen covers the roof of this area.

The average depth of water in this area is only 25 feet. Because of the flow of water here, the pygmies have placed huge clams that are the size of wash tubs on the bottom. They are able to bring in plenty of nutrients here and flourish. Every month or so the pygmies dive down, place a net around the clam they desire to harvest, then pry it loose and use their canoes to haul it to area

13. From there, they carry it up to the tribal hall (area 7) open it, boil and eat the mussel. The shell is then used for beds, or as containers. If there is a pearl in the clam it is given to the young pygmies to play with, as the mature ones place no value on such objects.

There is a 50% chance that a giant clam has a pearl inside it valued at 25-150gp wholesale.

Egress from this area via the channel west is possible, but the passage is completely submerged after 300 feet distance and exit must be by swimming underwater for another 60 feet to reach the River Nemo’s bed. This is managed with easy by the degenerate pygmies that have the capacity to swim rapidly and hold their breath for four minutes.

#### The Salt Mines


**Location: Serpent Ridge

**Encounter **Chart:** Hills

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Serpent Ridge, River Nemo, Purple Tower Road, Dunfalcon, Yggsburgh College

The first Lord Yggs, Franz, discovered salt along the west end of the Serpent Ridge. He ordered digging to commence and soon a whole stratum of the mineral was uncovered. The mine produced a fair quantity of pure sodium chloride. The income from this enabled Lord Yggs to become wealthy. Since the initial discovery the mine has been enlarged, and continues to produce excellent salt in large quantities. The operation is a monopoly of Yggsburgh. The mine now produces about 10 tons of salt each day, most of which is sent down the River Nemo, for sale in Dunfalcon City or export from there to other urban centers. The salt is mainly for use in preserving food, and so is in high demand.

The mine is worked by convicted criminals sentenced to penal servitude. If they perform well in their labors, the time spent mining is counted as double, effectively reducing their sentence by half if they work hard. There are some 30 felons laboring in the mine. These convicts are under the supervision of two gnome mining engineers, and guarded by soldiers and prisoner trustees. The gnome supervisors are on duty during working hours, as are the trustees. There are always at least two halberdiers and crossbowmen on duty.

###### Adventure Hook

Sages at Yggsburgh College have found mention of the Serpent Ridge in an old text. The work claims that ancient peoples dwelling hereabouts worshiped a serpent deity and thus held the ridge as sacred. This account mentions that primitive shamans built a secret place of sacrifice somewhere along the ridge and sacrificed many innocent people to honor that malign serpent. It is claimed that the spirits of those sacrificial victims cannot rest until the altar stone is broken.

The details of this adventure are up to the Castle Keeper, but ghosts and other manifestations of the departed are likely actors in the drama created. There are two possibilities. First, the altar stone could be hidden in a mound near the salt mines and protected by


evil worshipers of the serpent deity. Recent encroachments by the miners have caused the current worshipers to take action, or the miners have disturbed the spirits of the sacrificial victims who now are taking their toll on the miners. Another possibility is that the miners have uncovered an altar in the salt mines and have thus released the souls of those victims. Further, a cabal of evil worshipers in the surrounding area, or Yggsburgh, has also come to investigate.

#### The Hidden Message


**Location: The Four Tors

**Encounter **Chart:** Hills

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Yggsburgh College,

More than one scholar has wondered at the four strange round hills comprising the Four Tors. Noting that as one progresses from the highest tor in the north to the smallest in the south, the height difference of each is 45 degrees less than the previous. Is it coincidence, or do the number four, the direction north, the height differences, and their individual or collective elevations, have some arcane meaning? Couple their noted qualities with the fact that lightning strikes them with inordinate frequency, and many seeking occult lore believe the Four Tors to be of special importance, a mystery waiting to be solved, hidden knowledge revealed. It is not mere coincidence! One of the portals of the Hidden Portal Nexus is located on the highest and northernmost tor in a cave

The Hidden Portal Nexus is an extraordinary group of six portals that all access a nexus dimension. These portals are virtually undetectable, save for a faint shimmering of color in the area as noted hereafter. The portals can be found at the following locations. The color of each dimensional door’s radiance noted after its location.

1.1. 	Near the top of the highest tor of the 4 Tors, in a small cave—azure.
1.1. 	In a small grove of ash trees very near Castle Zagyg— ochre.
1.1. 	In a stony gulley behind an outhouse in a peasant village in the Westfields—ruby.
1.1. 	Deep within the Wychwood forest, next to a dead yew tree—emerald.
1.1. 	On a small, rocky islet in Bigfish Lake, about 800 yards from the shore of Garham—mauve.
1.1. 	Deep within a gnome mine underground in the Goldwood—amber.

Each of these portals leads to a circular chamber of 20-foot diameter—likely another dimensional matrix—with six archways, all glowing with the colors indicated above. When an individual, or group enters one of the portals, the archway they came through is inactive, leaving them to choose one of the other five ways. The user can stay in the chamber for five minutes only; otherwise all within the chamber are sucked into one of the portals at random.

Magic can work here but it is unable to escape this space via dimensional travel, send or receive communications outside it, summon creatures, or damage or alter the walls or portals in any way. This leads a few sages to believe this space is a pocket plain composed of a conceptual dimension.

The chamber also seems to have some sort of time isolation effect. People who spend a few minutes in the chamber, then enter a portal appear exactly at the time they went through the first portal. Those who have experimented with this have found that if two people enter different portals at the same time, they do not meet each other in the chamber, and the same thing occurs if one person enters the portal, and the second person enters after a minute passes.

The portals were initially discovered by young students at Yggsburgh College about 50 years ago, and today there is a small clandestine fraternity on the campus whose secret includes knowledge of the portals. Because of this, the college faculty in general, and some of the town aristocrats too, know about these portals, though they keep this in strict confidentiality. It is likely that the Thieves’ Guild, a few bandit groups, and perhaps some other individuals might know about these dimensional portals, but that is uncertain.

Nobody knows who created these portals, though a few sages say it doesn’t seem to be a creation of Zagyg, as they are predictable and ordered.

###### Adventure Hook

If the characters find reference to this lore in the library’s special reference room or discover it through Yggsburgh College, perhaps they can discover an answer or even the location of the hidden portal nexus. The Castle Keeper must determine what answer the characters actually find. Is this mere chance? Is there iron ore in these great hills? Are hidden artifacts buried beneath them? Are there portals to other planes hidden atop them? Is it a combination of all the above? These are only a few of the many possibilities open to development.

In addition to this region being the former home of the current Lord Mayor of Yggsburgh, the Druid Lochinvar, it is also home to a small tribe of elves living peacefully under its boughs. The Castle Keeper should decide whether or not the elves live in a small village or are nomadic. The elves number about 200, of which about 50 are warrior types. They are led by Trasolin Shrike. He is aided by the priestess Jaylis Goodoaks and the marshal Linvillion Lynxkin. The home or residence of Trasolin Shrike has 6 elixirs of healing which heal 4-16 point of damage, 20 gems worth 10- 1,000gp each, and 25gp.

###### Adventure Hook

Reports of travelers on the Menhir Hills Road being attacked by strange and terrible beasts, coming not from the Greypools Mire but from the west, have been circulating in the Yggsburgh area. A recent attack on shepherds and their flocks near the Meadow Creek seems to have been perpetrated by the same sorts of beasts, possibly werewolves and wolves. The lord mayor is concerned about the loss of lives and commercial traffic, so is offering a reward of 750gp for the extermination of the creatures responsible. Non-citizens are welcome to join in the hunt and if they succeed, such persons are to be granted rights as town citizens as well as paid the reward.

The Castle Keeper should decide what type or types of creatures are perpetrating the attacks, per party level and interest. Werewolves can be used and perhaps a member of the elven tribe is the one infected with the lycanthropy. A pack of wolves is also an option; perhaps they are in some manner attached to the elven community or are harrying them.

#### Ransoms and Bludgeonings


**Location:** Deerwood/Buckswood Hills **Encounter **Chart: Woods or Wooded Hills **Zagyg Adventure Reference:** Moatgate

The forested and hilly regions of the Deerwood and Buckswood Hills are sparsely inhabited and often used for hunting by the notables and other lesser sorts of Yggsburgh. Travel here can be dangerous as small groups of brigands and cutthroats have made their home here and other even less savory sorts wander the hills and dales looking for opportunities of the less than honorable sort.

This hill country was the heart of Druidical religious activity for many centuries prior to the contemporary time. Some three

hundred years ago the adherents of other doctrines proliferated in the whole area, so that today Druidism is followed by only

a small minority of humans, their numbers being scarcely twice that of the Elven faithful. There are scattered about in the Menhir Hills many monolithic ringstone circles and cairn structures, most of them of no great size in regards area or standing stones. A few are used as active places of Druidical worship, but most such places are deserted and forgotten, with oak and ash groves serving as natural temples for such services and rites.

###### Adventure Hooks

1. A party of wealthy merchants from Yggsburgh, on a day’s hunting excursion, are reported missing the morning following their departure. Shortly thereafter, a disreputable vagabond (possibly of mixed race; a half-orc, some surmise) appears at the Moatgate, gives the guards there a package for the Lord Mayor and goes off in a hurry. The message in the package demands a ransom of 5,000 in gold coin for each of the six merchants. This is to be delivered at the great yew beside the Urt River in 48 hours, or else the captive merchants are to be killed. Their signet rings are included in the bundle as proof of captivity. Each family concerned has agreed to pay the money demanded. But if those taking the gold to the kidnappers can free the captives and kill (or bring to justice) the criminals holding the merchants hostage, the families promise that all of the ransom money will be paid to the persons accomplishing the feat and bringing justice to the felons!

The band of kidnappers is a motley crew. They are lead by Black Brad and his doxy Apple Alice. They are detailed below. Their levels should be altered to reflect the adventuring party’s so as to represent a decent challenge. The merchants are tied up or incapacitated at nearly all times.

Black Brad is the master of the gang and none too bright a fellow. _(He is a chaotic eeil, humau, 2ud-7th leeel fighter whose eital _stats _are: _HP _7 _per _leeel, _AC _16. _His _prime _attributes _are _str, cou, _dex. _His _attributes _are: _str _14, _cou _14, _dex _17, _iut _8, _wis _9,_

1. A lone hunter returns from an excursion in the Deerwood, wounded and barely alive. He reports that a strange and savage beast fell upon him and his companions, killed four of them, and only by luck did he manage to escape to tell the terrible tale. Hearing this account, the town constable announces a reward of 5,000gp for bringing in the creature responsible, dead or alive. The Yggsburgh town crier heralds news of this event in the squares and soon all local folk are aware of the incident. Healed by one of the town priests, this yokel reluctantly agrees to guide a band of brave adventurers into the forest to the place where the attack occurred. He knows only that the monster that attacked his party was lightning fast, had terrible claws and teeth, and slew his fellows with single blows. More than this, he does not recall.

Although the description likens the beast to an ogre and ape, this creature is not a hybrid but a particularly large and vicious species of carnivorous gorilla. It now wanders the Deerwood and Buckswood Hills in search of prey.

**Location: Greenridge/Long Forest

**Encounter **Chart: Wooded Hills

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Green Ridge, Long Forest

The Long Forest covers much of the Greenridge. It is not without its problems, though they are usually rare and taken care of by the few men and elves who live here. Of late however, outside help may be needed to put an end to the depredations of a band of humanoids.

###### Adventure Hook

Word comes from the northern reaches of the Long Forest that a tribe of humanoids is moving southwest in the hills. They are fleeing some fearsome creature that has come into what was their home territory further to the north. These displaced humanoids are now marauders, and their path of destruction is leading straight to Garham. From there, they will likely be moving on unless checked beforehand.

There are two possible ways to prevent their depredations. They can be attacked and eliminated, or they can be parleyed with, perhaps convinced to return northwards with a promise that the monster which drove them out will be slain by an adventuring party.

The type and number of humanoids is left up to the Castle Keeper to decide. Referencing the Orders of Battle Appendix for goblins, orcs, gnoles or others allows the Castle Keeper to create a goblin or orc tribe which can then be used for this adventure. Likewise, the type of monster that chased the humanoids out of their homeland is best left up to the Castle Keeper, but it is suggested a green dragon (who has no lair but is, rather, in search of one) or band of hill giants (also having no lair) be used. Whichever is chosen, the monster is still searching out the humanoids and chasing them further south. To truly bring this episode to a successful close, the party must travel forth, locate the offending monster and once located, kill it or them.

#### Lead and War


**Location: Lakepens Hills/Lake Woods

**Encounter **Chart: Wooded Hills

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference:** Longforest, Greenridge, Garham, Menhir Hills, 9. Refugee

Garham sits on the northern verge of the Lakepens and Lakepens Hills. The region is fairly peaceful and sparsely inhabited. Few make their way here from Garham…until recently, that is. The Lakepens Hills are not known for their mineral wealth but rather for their forests and trees, but small amounts of lead are known to be located there. This has brought some gnomish and dwarvish prospectors in search of the ore.

###### Adventure Hook

Gangs of dwarf and gnome miners have come to the area from the Menhir Hills to begin prospecting. Having heard about the lead found near Garham, they camped near there and began prospecting for that mineral as well as silver ore. Naturally the folk of the hamlet are incensed at these demi-humans invading what they consider their land, and the men of Garham are organizing for war. They intend to attack and drive out the interlopers by force of arms! What can the characters do to avert such a conflict? If it can not be prevented, is there any action that the adventurers can take to lessen its harm?

The dwarven prospectors are lead by Inar and Jurgen Ironforge. Have they heard of brewing war in Garham? Are they themselves preparing for war? What is their relation to the gnomish prospectors? The Castle Keeper must decide the complexity of the issue and what, if anything, can be done to prevent war.

Inar Ironforge _(He is a ueutral, dwarf, 7th leeel fighter whose eital stats _are: _HP _49, _AC _18. _His _prime _attributes _are: _str, _cou, _dex. _His_ _attributes _are: _str _16, _cou _14, _dex _12, _iut _10, _wis _11, _cha _11. _He carries _bauded _mail, _a _+2 _shield, _a _+2 _warhammer _aud _120gp.)_

The gnomish prospectors are led by Trupilgan Ravine and his right hand man, Dutiful Gnarro Badger. How closely are they encamped to the dwarves? What is their relation to the dwarves and the men of Garham? These and other details should be worked out by the Castle Keeper as best fits keeping the party interested and challenged.

#### Invasion


**Location: East Uplands/Richwood Forest

**Encounter **Chart: Wooded Hills

###### Zagyg Adventure Reference:

The East Uplands and the Richwood Forest are home to some elves and some few foresters. Their stretches are plentiful in game and wealthy in timber. The Marquis of Talworth considers this his domain, though he has little control over it and the elven inhabitants certainly do not recognize him as their ruler.

###### Adventure Hook

News is spreading that Edgar, Marquis of Talworth, has determined to rid the forest he considers his own preserve of its elven inhabitants so he can harvest timber, as well as hunt, therein. To this end, he is gathering his vassals and hiring some mercenaries to do his bidding. The folk of Yggsburgh are much concerned, for if Talworth’s border moves west to encompass the East Uplands and the Richwood Forest, he will be placed in a position to invade Yggsburgh with ease. Yggsburgh cannot take direct action against Edgar, as that would be sufficient for Talworth to declare war, and then all of the free town’s foes would descend on Yggsburgh. Perhaps a band of heroic adventurers might venture into the Richwood to assist the elves against the marquis’ initial thrust, and quash his plans for an easy and cheap conquest thus…

The Marquis has engaged a small band of orc raiders for his first foray into the Richwood forest. They have come to harry and waylay the elves living therein.

#### Shunned by Preference


**Location: East Uplands, South/Dire Forest

**Encounter **Chart: Dire Forest

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Orders of Battle: Marquis of Talworth, Marquis of Talworth, Waldgraf Horst Reindmann,

22. Invasion

The Dire Forest is a most dangerous place, as is implied by its name, especially in the western portion. The old hardwoods have a thick canopy, making it a dark place even in daylight. This darkness allows for few normal plants or common animals to grow here or graze beneath its boughs.

Its southwestern edge (that portion visible on the map) marks the western and southmost boundary of the lands of the Marquis of Talworth. This area is under the control of one of the Marquis’ leigemen, the dark and malign Waldgraf Horst Reindmann. Even though he maintains clearings, and sends forth parties of woodcutters to cut trees in certain parts of the forest and to clear places such that they become more hospitable, the Waldgraf’s portion of the forest is scarcely more hospitable than the rest. The Waldgraf has a stronghold adjacent to a small thorp deep in the Dire Forest. It is difficult to access from anywhere but the Marquis of Talworth’s lands. He maintains a small garrison at the fortress.

This latter is a dangerous assignment. Fell creatures resist the intrusion of the woodsmen and other travelers, playing havoc with axe-men, armed guards and others. Also, some unnatural force seems to be at work, causing the undergrowth to spring up quickly. Even saplings have been known to grow to become thigh- thick trees in a year or less. This, and a fear of the sentient trees and plants said to inhabit the woods, makes the whole place one that is shunned by preference.

###### The Environs of Yggsburgh

###### Adventure Hook

A ranger and local woodsman seeks out the characters to find out if they are likely candidates for a mission against the perversion that is the Waldgraf Horst Reindmann. That noble, he explains, has been able to disguise his evil intent, thus operating as a normal druid in the Dire Forest. He is at work building a force of malign plant creatures within the Dire Forest. The parties of woodsmen and hunters he sends forth to do his bidding are meant to be slaughtered and feed these daemons. If he continues with this masquerade and succeeds, the whole of the area will fall under his sway. What the ranger does not know, is that Reindmann then plans to assassinate the Marquis of Talworth and take over the whole of that march. When he commands all this, the fate of Yggsburgh and its territory is certain.

This is an exceedingly dangerous adventure. Adjustment of non- player character and monster levels, hit die and stats may be necessary to fit the party’s needs. The Waldgraf need not be in residence in his cave, as his are the only stats that should not be adjusted. If he is not in his cave (described below), it will not take him long to discover who attacked it.

Ranger _(He _is _a _ueutral _good, _humau, _5th-8th _leeel _rauger _whose_ _eital stats are: HP 5 per leeel, AC 18. His prime attributes are: str,_ _iut, wis. His attributes are: str 13, cou 12, dex 16, iut 10, wis 14,_

_cha 12. He carries bracers of defeuse AC 16, a +2 lougbow, +1_ _arrows x10, lougsword, dagger, cloak of the woodlaud aud 45gp.)_

The Waldgraf Horst Reindmann, when not in residence at his fortress, carries out maleficent experiments upon the plants of the Dire Forest. He does so from a small cave hidden deep in the hills of the region, a place that only the ranger has located. Approaching the cave is a perilous task. It is surrounded and protected by the Waldgraf’s ‘experiments.’ There is an outer ring of adder alders, grabgrass, hackthorn trees and finally a killer willow (see Monster Appendix).

The adder alders make up an outer ring around the cave entry. They stand about 20 feet apart or more. Between each is a 10 x 20-foot patch of grabgrass. The latter latch onto their prey, immobilizing them while the adder alders attack. Within this ring is a tight ring of hackthorn trees between 10 and 20 feet from one another. They move to the sound of battle and thrash any interlopers. Guarding the cave entry is a deadly killer willow. If the Waldgraf is here, he will be in the cave for the first portion of the attack. Usually not until the killer willow is attacked will he make an appearance, believing his fiendish plants will manage well without him.

#### The Cursed Mine


**Location: Glittering Knobs/Goldwood

**Encounter **Chart: Wooded Hills

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: River Nemo, Yggsburgh College Library, Thieves’ Guild, Abounding Lode

The Glittering Knobs are rich in minerals. There are many mines in the region taking out gold, silver, copper, lead, garnet and quartz gem crystals. The oldest of the mines are in the northern, unforested portion, where such operations have been operating for several centuries, and most of the diggings there are played out and abandoned. Only a few are still worked by dwarf and gnome miners able to find and dig out small veins of ore and other minerals.

There are four large mines in the region. Each produces, on a monthly basis, an average 50,000gp in ingots and worked gems at market value. These yields are carted, loaded on barges, and sent down the River Nemo at a cost of 10% of the market value of the minerals, and bought by five factors (gold, silver, copper, lead, and gems), in the town at 60% value. The factors’ operating profit is only about 10% after overhead costs and taxes, but that leaves 5000gp monthly net income, divided between them, for only one of the demi-human mines.

Elsewhere in the Glittering Knobs, various miners and panners are taking out reasonable amounts of gold, silver, copper, lead, and gem crystals. About 20 mines and a handful of lone panners produce an average monthly income of 20,000gp each for their minerals, at market value for their refined/finished material. That comes to 400,000gp in value when all is done, twice the demi- human mines’ yield in finished product. Gold dust and nuggets, uncut crystals, and raw ore are carted from hill locations to river barges that carry the minerals to Yggsburgh for refining, casting into ingots, coins, and other working such as cutting and setting for gem minerals.

The Castle Keeper can assume that many of the miners are able combatants—fighters, rangers, and thieves of moderate level. Here is a roster for dwarven, gnomish and human miners.

That gives a 1 in 4 chance of finding a mine in which there will be a hidden repository containing 100-400 gem crystals of base 50gp value each, or else gold ore of 10,000 to 80,000gp value, or silver ore of 5,000 to 100,000gp (d20 x 5,000gp) value. Unprocessed ore is basically a lot of broken-up rocks, of course, and will need to be transported to the River Nemo and sold to a factor’s agent there. If the copper and lead mines are considered, their mined ore will be even bulkier and as heavy, with a value of 5,000 to 40,000gp and 5,000 to 30,000gp, respectively.

###### The Cursed Mine

This mining complex is designed for characters of moderate level. A party of 4th-6th level adventurers should fare well. Should a higher or lower level party enter the mines, simply reduce or increase the number of opponents encountered, their hit points, armor classes, or even hit dice.

The Cursed Mine is far from played out. On the contrary, it is full of veins of gold ore. It is also filled with gray dwarves, various monsters, and a conniving and unscrupulous elder xorn that has ‘mind powers’ like those of the Gray Dwarves, only superior. The exact location of the mine is left in the hands of the Castle Keeper. The diggings are generally in the north central portion of the Glittering Knobs, out of sight of the River Nemo but not too far distant from it. What is around the mine can be whatever the Castle Keeper wishes. Information regarding the Cursed Mine can be gained by the adventurers in many ways. Several are listed below.

Meeting and conversing with any residents of the Glittering Knobs/Goldwood area will reveal a great amount of information.

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

In conversing about prospecting or mining opportunities with any mining-connected businessman, much information can be gained. These include bankers, any official of the town that deals with revenues, an ore hauler (barge owner or hand), or a chance-met prospector or miner (especially a dwarf or gnome).

The Yggsburgh College library has some information in the section containing works that deal with local folklore and legends. Also, in a text dealing with mineral resources is the following information about the Cursed Mine:

_There are no_ _working mines in the northern portion of the Glittering Knobs, that section of the hills not covered by the Goldwood. This is not to _say there are not valuable mineral resources in this place. On the contrary, some _two _decades _back _a gold strike was made there by dwarven miners. They _named _their _shaft _the Abounding Lode because _of the nearly pure vein of gold they were following. About _three _years _later _the dwarves disappeared, and when it was apparent they had abandoned _their claim and were not coming back, gnomes _moved _in _to _exploit the _mine. _They _brought _out a considerable amount of ore in the several months they _worked _the _digging,_

_then _they _too _disappeared. _When _it _was _apparent_

_that _the _gnomes _had _also _pulled _up _stakes _for some reason—no evidence of foul play was ever discovered, and in both cases the mine was simply abandoned—human miners stepped in and began work _there. _They _lasted _only _a _week, _then _vanished as had those before them._

_Rumors about the Abounding Lode mine were common after the original crew of dwarves went missing. _When _the _gnomes _also _vanished, _the _stories proliferated _and _became _more _gruesome. _After _the third mining team disappeared, _leaving _not _a _clue as _to _what _happened _to _them, _the _place _received a new name: the Cursed Mine. Supposedly several other parties of would-be miners who sought to exploit the diggings over the next few years were never _heard _from _again. _This _made _the _new _name_


_take on an even more ominous tone that was sufficient _to _discourage _even _the _hardiest _of _miners. The whole area has been shunned ever after. Prospectors avoid the bald knobs there, swearing that _something _dark _and _dreadful _now _makes _them its home, issuing forth from the abandoned mine _to creep through the darkness, hunting for any trespassers and carrying them off without leaving a trace._

In any friendly dealings with a knowledgeable member of the Thieves’ Guild, especially one who is involved in smuggling or other river-connected activities, information of a different type is yielded. To loosen the tongue, several drinks should be bought and coins exchange hands. If done so properly, the following information can be learned:

_There are still dwarves in the supposedly cursed mine. How do I know? Ah, that’s easy. One-Eyed Billy takes a load of supplies up the Nemo every month, he does. He and his boys packs the stuff up into the hills, leave the lot at the mine entrance, where some mean-lookin’ dwarf pays’ em off with gold ingots. They pays triple value for the grain, hops, livestock, and ordinary stuff like flour, salt, and vegetables, plus 50gp per man for delivery— double that for Billy’s services._

###### Background

A company of dwarven prospectors discovered an exposed vein of gold in the northern Glittering Knobs some 38 years ago. They went to work digging out excellent ore. Soon they had a lateral mine shaft dug, and discovered the vein played out. They were not discouraged by this, as the mineral matrix promised more gold. They were encouraged, and actually used most of their accumulated wealth to recruit more of their fellows, and kept digging. After a year their activities were noted by others in the region, prompting the leader of the dwarves to register a claim in Yggsburgh. This meant the miners would have to send their gold ore to Yggsburgh, but would not have to worry about claim jumpers stealing their mine. The official operations in the “Abounding Lode” thus began a bit over a year after the dwarves had actually begun work there. Their increased numbers meant that the miners could expand their work, and so multiple tunnels were hewn from the rock, all mainly lateral as the veins of ore were thus positioned.

However, one vein to the east northeast angled downwards, so a shaft was dug to follow it. After a year it played out, but traces were found to the north. Following those, the dwarves found the vein resumed again, now angling down and to the east. This they followed. Eventually they broke into a natural cavern in which a large pool of water was discovered.

This great grotto had a natural passage leading eastwards to a whole complex of passages, caves, and caverns. The dwarves sealed the natural passage with rocks, thinking to keep whatever denizens of the subterranean maze that lay beyond out of their prosperous mine. That effort succeeded for only a relatively short time. The work of the dwarves was discovered by a clan of gray dwarves. These sly cousins of the miners removed most of the rocks, so as to enter the diggings and investigate.

Using their mental powers to blind the ordinary dwarves to their presence, the gray dwarves soon assessed the mine as a great prize and one well worth some killing to gain. Word was sent back to the clan, and the warriors of the Dark Delvers infiltrated the diggings to attack. They made sure to pick off gangs of miners separately to avoid fighting a large pitched battle. In a few hours they managed to slaughter every one of their cousins. The gray dwarves deemed enslaved workers not likely to be efficient but likely to cause trouble. If a single one escaped, their game would be up and other dwarves would come to drive them off. As a result, none were spared.

Thus, the dwarves “disappeared” and the gray dwarves went to work digging out the veins of gold the former owners had

###### The Environs of Yggsburgh

discovered. Their chief, Drugan the Hammer, was much pleased as little ingots of bullion accumulated in his personal hoard. There was no grumbling from his clansfolk either, as the mine was so rich that even the avaricious chief could not begrudge ample shares of this vast wealth to his clansmen.

Being so great a prize, these thieves were careful to guard against other robbers who might come from the outside world to lay claim to the mine. That precaution was well-founded. In a few short months, a gang of gnomes came trudging up to the entrance of the mine and sent scout teams inside to explore it. Being suspicious (because of the disappearance of the dwarves) the gnomes were not taken by total surprise. Warnings from scouts enabled the gnomes to ready themselves for invisible opponents. A fight was had. It was a long and bloody one but, in the end, the gray dwarves slew the lot of them, taking some considerable losses themselves in the process.

Rather than seek replacements, the gray dwarves decided to keep the mine to themselves, thus having larger shares of gold. Again, their chief, Drugan the Hammer, stationed lookouts for new intruders who might steal into their mine.

When groups came to claim the “abandoned” mine, they were each less numerous than the gnome explorers had been. These groups were allowed to penetrate well into the diggings before being ambushed and slaughtered by the gray dwarves. A few prisoners from each unfortunate party were taken and put to work as slaves. Thus, things seemed to be going well indeed for the murderous interlopers. In time, there were no new would-be claimants appearing, the slaves died off from overwork, and the malign dwarves were alone with their ever-growing hoard of gold.

Then things changed. An aberrant elder xorn, burrowing for tasty minerals, came upon the underground lake, sensed the rich aroma of pure gold, and began exploring the caverns and the mine shaft leading from it.

The elemental creature was filled with much joy (as much as its kind is capable of feeling) when it detected the thoughts of the gray dwarves. They were easily managed by the xorn’s own mind, as the two possessed similar mental prowess—but the gray dwarves’ powers were inferior. Thus, they were subject to the xorn’s illusions and suggestions, and quite incapable of discovering that they were being manipulated.

After observing them unseen for a time, the mineral elemental worked out a plan. The elder xorn appeared to the chief of the gray dwarves in the form a golden deity, naming himself Thaarl Goldhand and claiming to be a mighty gray dwarf of supernatural power and awesome majesty. The xorn worked his illusions. Drugan the Hammer became a believer in a hurry, and all doubts were shredded when the disguised aberrant elder xorn introduced his “servants,” earth mephits and small salamanders.

Since then, the gray dwarves have had an easy time smelting ore, thanks in large part to the salamanders. These elemental creatures have even been heating the gray dwarves’ brewing vats to boiling to help make ale. As ordered by their chief, and under supervision of the earth mephits, the gray dwarves bring their ingots of gold

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

to the shrine of Thaarl Goldhand where the “deity” blesses them that they might grow in weight. The bullion is then cast into the depths of a great pool outside the shrine for safekeeping.

That’s what the gray dwarves believe, anyway. In actuality, when the ingots are placed before the idol, the “blessing” consists of the xorn sequestering the metal for later consumption. Needless to say, this creature has grown very large and what would be called corpulent for an animal. The only gold the gray dwarves have gained for their labor is the tithe they are permitted to keep as immediate reward.

###### The Mines

All 10-foot-wide shafts in the mines have rough-hewn floors and walls, and arched ceilings that, at their apex, are 10 feet above the floor. The stone is damp and a strange form of lichen grows in scattered patches on the floors, ceilings, and walls at intervals of around 30 feet. This stuff is known as glowlichen and it emits a faint blue light that enables vision to a distance of about 10 feet for normal characters (similar to the light from a glowstick). Tunnels that are 20 feet wide have ceilings that reach an apex of 15 feet.

An “E” indicates where a shaft ends and digging has stopped. There are obvious signs of drilling, chipped stone, cracked wall faces, and a litter of broken stone on the floor near the ends of these tunnels. When in a dead end, the party will be attacked by the bats dwelling there.

Cave Bat x1-10+20 _(These creatures’ eital stats are: HD 1d2, HP _1, _AC _12, _ueutral. _Caee _bats _attack _by _swarmiug _exposed_ _portious _of _the _body. _Their _attacks _are _iu _groups _of _four, _aud _they_ _receiee _1 _attack _for _each _four _bats. _If _a _hit _is _scored, _1 _poiut _of_ _damage is iuflicted from scratches aud bites. They receiee a +3 to _all _to _hit _rolls. _They _attack _for _ouly _1d4 _rouuds _before _leaeiug.)_

1. **Entrance to the Abounding Lode Mine** From outside of the mines to just before the tunnel jogs southeast, there is a foreshortening of the passageway for 90 feet. After the party proceeds some 60 feet into the mine entrance, they see a flicker ahead, something like ghostly dwarves. Then suddenly the party has crossbow quarrels whirring amongst them as the gray dwarves unleash a volley. When they look again, they see nothing in the tunnel save darkness. After their initial volley, the attackers immediately retreat around the bend in the passage, become invisible, and separate.

Two of the gray dwarves then head northeast to alert their fellows in that section of the mine, while three head south to do the same there. The one left behind peers around the corner and generates an illusion of six of his kind. These reappear in the passage firing crossbows at the party. When the illusion is destroyed, he runs at his best speed to the entrance to area 2, peers around that corner, and generates the illusion of six more crossbow-armed gray dwarves. These illusions attack the party as the previous ones did. When these phantom images are destroyed, he hastens to join his fellows in area 4.

Gray Dwarf, miner x6 _(HD _1d10, _HP _6, _AC _16, _EQ _crossbow,_ _short sword, bauded mail, iugot worth 10gp. Special: str 15.)_


Castle Keeper note: As a reminder, an illusion generated by a gray dwarf, struck by anything causing 1 or more points of damage, wavers and collapses into the floor as if melting incredibly fast. Of course there is no trace of any “body” where the illusion was thus destroyed.

1. **Inclined Passageway** The tunnels indicated by a line in the middle of the passage are inclined downward to the east at a gradient of about two feet over five. It is a noticeable slope. Running herein by the characters risks a chance of stumbling, tripping or falling. A dexterity check at -3 is necessary when running down the slope to prevent falling. No damage will accrue to the character that falls, but anything held in hand has a chance of being dropped. Another dexterity check must be made, with failure indicating any items held are dropped. Anything dropped may roll or scatter down the hallway, requiring at least a round to recover.
1. **Chamber This 30’ x 30’ chamber has a 15’ high ceiling. There is no glowlichen in this room. Waiting in this place is an earth mephit—a lumpy, thin, and gangly gnome-like beast with wings. It was stationed here by the aberrant elder xorn as a reminder to the gray dwarves of the power of their “deity.” Of course this creature attacks the party when they enter the chamber.

The earth mephit is hovering above the floor at 10’ height, just inside the entry. It allows the first person entering to pass unless they see it. It then attacks the most likely target in the second rank with its breath weapon or whomever looks up at it. It then summons additional mephits and flies down to attack the initial character entering the chamber.

Mephit, earth _(This_ _creature’s_ _eital_ _stats_ _are_ _HD_ _3,_ _HP_ _16,_ _AC _16, _chaotic _eeil. _Its _prime _attributes _are: _physical. _It _attacks_ _with 2 claws for 1-4 damage each.

1. **Ledge This stone ledge is of varying width, and one foot above the pool of water to the east. There are patches of glowlichen spread around this chamber. The entire cavern is approximately 80 feet across and 170 feet long at its greatest. The entrance to area 5 cannot be seen from any position except the ledge at the entry or from a location above the water and to its north.

There are 15 gray dwarves waiting in here to ambush the party. There is a group of three waiting near the entry. The others are divided into two groups, with 5 miners and a leader in each group. They are 20 feet from the entrance passage with one group on each side of it. When the whole party is on the ledge, they attack.

As the intruders have threatened the sacred place of their “deity,” the gray dwarves attack relentlessly and without fear of death. They remain visible and press in from both sides to try and force the characters into the water in the hopes they will drown.

They will fight thus to the last. Any one of them not engaged for a round will concentrate on creating the illusion of any fallen fellows jumping up and returning to the fray.

If the party breaks through to the south, the gray dwarves concentrate on creating the illusion of anaconda-like snakes emerging from the pool of water that then attack the characters. The illusions act as large snakes and attempt to coil around the characters feet and cause them to trip and fall. Should the illusion work, the character so entwined must make a dexterity check at

-7 or trip and fall. If this happens, the character must then make another dexterity check at -8 or plummet into the watery hole beneath. Should the characters not be able to swim, they likely drown. Even those that know how to swim suffer a -5 to their swim check if the illusory anacondas are still attacking them.

**4A. Underground Pool** This pool is 70’ east-to-west and 150’ north-to-south. The gray dwarves catch and eat many fish from this body of water. Phosphorescent plants growing in the water enable the observer to see some 40 feet into it. It is filled with fish of varying size. The largest of these are mostly red sunfish, platter crappie, and golden perch of two-foot and more length, and weighing six or more pounds. Smaller fish, the size of normal panfish on down to shuns and minnows, are also abundant.

The glitter of gold can be plainly seen by any character looking into the water from the entrance to area 5. It appears that there is a small mountain of gold ingots at the bottom and just below the ledge. This is actually a strong illusion created as a permanent semblance of bullion by the aberrant elder xorn. The “ingots” are rocks. Only if a dispel magic is cast upon them, or when they are taken out of the mine, will their true nature be revealed. Otherwise, it appears as if there are 10,000 little ingots each weighing 20 ounces and having a presumed value of 500gp each.

Around the base of the pile of ingots are some 20 skeletons— human and demi-human, including several gray dwarves (who were slain by their own belief in the xorn’s illusion). The bodies have been dumped here as sacrifices to the “deity.”

1. **Natural Cave** This cave is a 30’ x 25’ room with a ceiling arch. It contains the shrine the dwarves have established for their “deity.” The southeastern third of the grotto is clearly a place of worship, and near the cave wall towers a golden statue of what can only be a gray dwarf of colossal proportions—12 feet tall, six feet across the mailed shoulders. The visage of the statue shows a leering frown as one hand reaches forth at waist height while the right hand holds a massive, double-bitted axe overhead.


###### 143


The Environs of Yggsburgh

As anyone enters, an earth mephit comes from its place of concealment west of the entry to breathe on the first person setting foot in the grotto. It then flies up and summons additional mephits before diving down to attack with its claws.

Mephit, earth _(This _creature’s _eital _stats _are: _HD _3, _HP _16, _AC_ _16, _chaotic _eeil. _Its _prime _attributes _are: _physical. _It _attacks _with _2 claws _for _1-4 _damage _each. _See _3, _aboee, _for _special _abilities.)_

If and when the earth mephit is slain, that loss causes the illusory idol to speak: “Who dares to defile the sanctuary of the gray dwarf demigod, Thaarl Goldhand?! Turn and flee for your lives while you can!” The latter is a magical suggestion and acts as a fear spell cast by a 15th level cleric.

The statue is actually the elder xorn. After the spell is cast, the xorn, using its powers of illusion, attacks the party. The illusion covering the xorn will make it appear as if the great axe is whirling around and striking four times during a round—its claw and bite attacks. Anytime after being hit and damaged by a spell or weapon, the aberrant elder xorn foregoes its biting attack and instead suggests, “You don’t want to harm me!” Anytime after suffering the loss of 40 hit points, the xorn is likely to stop attacking. A charisma check is made each round starting with a -10. In each round thereafter that the xorn receives damage, another charisma check is made at an additional and cumulative

-5. If the xorn fails a charisma check, it spends the round adjusting its molecular structure, and sinks into the stone of the cave floor or into its wall, thus escaping back to its home plane. After all is said and done, this xorn has enjoyed its vacation on the Prime Material Plane, eaten gold to near surfeit, and is ready to return to its own plane.

Xorn, elder _(This _creature’s _eital _stats _are: _HD _15d10, _HP _120,_ _AC _25, _chaotic _eeil. _Its _prime _attributes _are: _physical. _It _attacks_ _with _3 _claws _for _1-6+5 _damage _each, _aud _a _bite _for _4d8 _damage.

1. **Chamber This is a 40’ x 40’ chamber with a 25’ arched ceiling. Many patches of glowlichen grow on its walls. This chamber is filled with growing fungi, as the floor is covered with a mulch of dead leaves and dung. It is a mushroom garden that supplies the inhabitants of the mine with one of their favorite foods.

Six gray dwarves are in the main chamber, spreading animal manure, tending to the fungi, and picking off beetles that they feed to chickens. If the party is quiet and not using a light source, they will surprise these workers. Otherwise, the dwarves will spot the intruders and attack them first, possibly by surprise.

The fungi growing here are large and luxuriant, consisting of such varieties as shaggy mane, puffball, morel, button, and brown mushrooms. Culled and tossed into a small pile just inside the chamber near the entry against the west wall are poisonous toadstools. Mixed in with them are 30 warty and bulbous yellow- green fungi with a disgusting odor like that of rotten cabbage. Eating one of these will empower the consumer with the capacity to see invisible things, including invisibility caused by illusion. It

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

also enables the eater to detect illusory things for one hour. These fungi dry naturally and may be kept for at least 6 months before losing their potency.

Noticing the pile is automatic if any character is searching the chamber in this area. Spotting the unusual mushrooms in it requires a detect magic spell, or the one examining the fungi must be a druid, wizard, ranger, or any type of dwarf character familiar with such things. In that case, the individual can recognize that these mushrooms are both edible and rumored to be magical, but their effects will not be known until one is consumed.

There are 8 goats and 12 sheep penned up in the tunnel to the northeast. They’re feeding on hay gathered locally by foraging parties late at night. In the dead end tunnel to the north, there are cages containing chickens. The livestock provides meat for the resident miners, as they found a steady diet of rats and lizards tedious, even if supplemented by occasional fish.

1. **Cavern** This is a 40’ x 40’ chamber with a 25’ high arched ceiling. The walls have many patches of glowlichen growing on them. This chamber is filled with growing fungi, its floor is covered with a mulch of dead leaves and odiferous dung. It is another mushroom garden similar to area 6.

Six gray dwarves are in the main chamber, spreading animal manure, tending to the fungi, and picking off beetles that are fed to the chickens in area 6. If the party is quiet and not using a light


source they will surprise these workers. Otherwise, the dwarves spot the intruders and attack them as they enter, but only a totally inept party will be surprised.

There are 12 pigs penned up in the tunnel to the northeast, feeding on the garbage from the dwarves’ table and roots brought in from above. In the dead end tunnel north there are cages containing rabbits fed on hay brought in from outside.

The fungi growing here are also large and luxuriant, consisting of such varieties as shaggy mane, puffball, morel, button, and brown mushrooms. Culled and tossed into a small pile just inside the chamber near the entry against the southwest wall, are poisonous toadstools. Mixed in with them are 20 small black fungi with leathery caps that look something like shittake mushrooms. Eating one of these empowers the consumer with the capacity to see in total darkness as if it were twilight, this effect persisting for 24 hours. Also in this discard pile are 12 small fungi with cratered blue caps. Eating one will heal 4d4 +4 hit points of damage. If the consumer is not below normal hit points, the effect of this fungus is to increase reaction speed so as to enable an extra attack in each round, and to add 1-2 points of physical strength to the one consuming the mushroom. The latter effects occur one round after consuming the fungus and persist for d4+12 minutes thereafter. These fungi dry naturally and may be kept for at least 6 months before losing their potency.

Noticing the pile is automatic for any character searching the chamber in this area. Spotting the unusual mushrooms in it requires a detect magic spell, or the one examining the fungi must be a druid, wizard, ranger, or any type of dwarf character. In that case, the individual will recognize that these mushrooms are both edible and rumored to be magical, but their effects will not be known until one is consumed.

1. **Dead End** Upon close inspection, this seeming dead end can be noted as unusual by any character who is familiar with mines and mining. The detritus is scant and there is none in the central portion of the floor. The dead end is actually a secret door. Anyone searching for a secret door has +3 to their chance of locating it. Once it is detected, opening and closing it is a matter of course.
1. **Secret **Cavern This is a 40’ x 40’ chamber with 25’ high arched ceilings. There are many patches of glowlichen along the walls and ceiling. Originally, this was the place where the company of dwarf miners hid away their bullion. When the gray dwarves took over the mine, they made it into a slave pen. There are leg chains and manacles fastened to the walls by eye-bolts. The floor is littered with filthy straw. Several wooden buckets for waste are visible. Near the entry passage is a big barrel full of water, and a stack of 20 small wooden bowls.

There are five gray dwarves stationed in the tunnel leading to the prison chamber. If the characters are relatively quiet, there is a chance of surprising the guards.

###### 144

It is the Castle Keeper’s decision as to whether or not there are any prisoners confined herein. If the characters have suffered losses, or are in need of help to survive, then there should be some non-player characters imprisoned herein. While some of them will be ordinary miners, one or more can be fighter, ranger, or thief, and of level commensurate with the party and its needs.

Should the Castle Keeper decide there are prisoners here, their number will be 5-8 commoners of varying races. Additionally, such special ones as are deemed appropriate for addition to the party as reinforcement non-player characters will be present. The prisoners may be human, demi-human, or whatever mix is desired.

1. **Dwarven **Hall This large chamber is 60’ x 20’ with a 35’ high arched ceiling. There are patches of glowlichen throughout the chamber. This place is where the Gray Dwarves gather to eat and socialize. The salient features are given below, and you should add such special touches as desired when describing the place. All the furnishings are, of course, sized for dwarves.

There are five trestle tables and 10 benches along the south wall. The central part of the hall is clear, forming an aisle east to west. There are two trestle tables, one with two benches, one with eight chairs, along the western portion of the north wall. All of the tables have plates and flagons atop them.

There is a great fireplace for heating and cooking in the center of the north wall, it being hewn from the living rock. The Castle Keeper should decide whether or not there is a fire going, with a spitted sheep or pig roasting there. Before the fireplace are various cooking utensils, kettles and pots, and a food preparation table. To the east of the fireplace is a long work bench and sink for cleaning dishes. Various containers for large quantities of foodstuffs are nearby.

At the eastern end of the hall is another fireplace. This also hewn from the rock, with an extended raised bed for holding hot coals. It is a forge, and near to it are a large and small anvil, sacks of charcoal, a bellows, iron bars, and various smithy tools.

The number of gray dwarf warriors encountered in the hall is left to the discretion of the Castle Keeper, but at least nine should be included. Their locations in the hall are given with each set of stat blocks.

The gray dwarves will attempt to take the following actions. When intruders enter the hall, the ordinary warriors discharge crossbows or grab spears and hurl them at the enemy, pick up their shields, draw swords, then become invisible on the round after firing their missiles. They do so at a charge to close to attack. The first ones into the fray attempt to knock the characters over, so the second wave of attackers can lay waste to them.

Meantime, the cleric casts his bless spell upon his fellows, then invisibly awaits developments. He uses dispel magic or inflict serious wounds as appropriate. If and when the sub-chief or chief is badly hurt, the cleric becomes visible and uses a healing spell to assist such individuals. Otherwise he remains invisible and defends himself with his hammer if detected. Should he see the chief depart the area, he follows.

The serjeant and smith become invisible, move to within melee range and attack the intruders with their hand weapons. This can take up to four rounds of time after the enemy is detected. The salamander simply springs from the bed of coals and slithers forth to attack the intruders.

The sub-chief and chief likewise become invisible. The chief generates the illusion of another salamander coming forth from the coals of the forge furnace. He then observes the course of battle for one or more rounds. If it appears that his fellows have a good chance of winning, he and the sub-chief move to within melee range and attack. If things are going badly, the two move as quickly as possible away, leaving by the southeast tunnel exit. From there, they head east and south to the wide tunnel behind area 11 to alert all those therein.

1. **Cavern This 30’ x 50’ chamber has a 25’ arched ceiling. There is no glowlichen in the cavern. This chamber is where food and equipment are stored. The supplies smuggled to the gray dwarves by the Yggsburgh Thieves’ Guild are kept here, along with other things gathered from outside or taken from victims of this malign bunch. There are also small carts here for moving ore to, and bullion from, the smelter in area 13. There are normally no gray dwarves here, but the aberrant elder xorn has placed an earth mephit here to keep tabs on the material and the dwarves.

The earth mephit is hovering above the floor, at 15’ height in the middle of the room. It allows the first person entering the room to pass unless it is noticed. It then attacks the most likely target in the second rank of the party with its breath weapon—or whomever looks up at it—then summons additional mephits and flies down to attack the initial character entering the chamber.

If the characters make a lot of noise in the battle with the mephit, the sleeping gray dwarves in 11a are alerted.

Besides foodstuffs and mining equipment, the Castle Keeper is to decide what items of value the characters might discover here. There will certainly be several suits of armor of better type, sized for gnomes, dwarves, and humans. Likewise, there will be a variety of shields and weapons. Included in the cache will be clothing of all sorts, and adventuring gear such as backpacks, canteens, belts, belt pouches, coils of rope, etc. Rations, wine, liquor, torches, oil, blankets, and like things will have been taken and used by the gray dwarves. There is little likelihood of discovering anything magical here, but the Castle Keeper can include one or two such objects if the party is in dire need.

**11a. Lodge** The 20-foot-wide passage to the east of area 11 is where the gray dwarves lodge. The 100-foot long tunnel is littered with the personal pallets of the gray dwarves. Piles of bedding are laid out at intervals along both the north and south walls of the


passageway. There are 35 ‘beds’ on either side of the hall, with more centered than near the east and west ends of the place. Near each pallet is a wicker hamper, or canvas carrying bag, containing the gear of the dwarf who beds down there. These are personal kits and contain spare clothing and odds and ends, but nothing of value. The individuals currently at rest here are listed below. It takes 20 rounds for any of these individuals to arise, arm and begin moving.

If alerted by the chief or sub-chief from area 10, these dwarves will be further along in their arming process, possibly fully ready by the time anyone arrives here. In such case, the two leaders will each generate an illusion of 10 regulars and 1 serjeant, fully armed and arrayed in a double line across the tunnel. The rear rank will be of crossbow-armed warriors, staggered so as to be able to fire between their comrades in front of them. The two leaders will remain invisible and bring the illusory warriors back to life to fight. This will last as long as the intruding adventurers seem to be affected by their illusions.

When the characters ignore the phantasmal figures, the chief and sub-chief will make a break back the way they came. If they are confronted with dead fellows everywhere, the two will attempt to exit the mine and escape. If cornered and given a chance to surrender, they will do so if promised that their lives will be spared and they will be released after giving over their wealth. Of course, both are murderers and criminals. If somehow taken prisoner and brought back to Yggsburgh to be questioned, the whole truth of the Abounding Lode mine will come out. The two will be hung, and the characters lauded for their good offices and offered claim ownership to the mine, free of any fee.

1. **Cavern This is a 20’ x 40’ chamber with a 15’ ceiling. There are patches of glowlichen growing along the walls and ceiling. Despite active mining at the southern end of the mine, this place is where the gray dwarves brew their ale. There are 12 barrels (each holding 60 gallons) of beer cached in the dead end tunnel just north and east of the room. Here, they can properly age for a week or so before being quaffed. There is a big copper vat of eight-foot diameter, set on legs at six feet height above the floor, in the rear of chamber and 10 feet from the south end. Beneath it, instead of a fire, is a salamander heating the water and brewing mash to steaming temperature. Next to it is another vat of nine- foot diameter, but only four feet off the floor. It is used for draining the boiled liquid and adding yeast to it for fermentation. A third vat, eight-foot diameter, two feet above the floor, receives the fermented ale and then the liquid is drained off to barrels. Besides the salamander, the dwarves working here will attack intruders.

It is likely that those in here will be surprised by intruders as they are working. They will stop what they were doing and attack the characters as soon as they are aware of them. The brew master

###### 146

will likely be the first into melee, followed by the salamander. The workers will themselves invisible, then each creates an illusory image of himself that appears close to the intruders, attacks, and after being hit and “melting” reappears the next round to attack again. Only when cornered and attacked will these workers actually fight physically.

1. **Tunnel** This is a 80’ x 30’ mine tunnel with a 20’ ceiling. There are a few patches of glowlichen in the tunnel. Smelting is done in this tunnel.

At the time the adventuring party enters, two salamanders are at work melting crushed ore in a big iron kettle, which is suspended on chains above the floor, 20 feet from the east end of the chamber. The gimbaled frame that holds the melting pot allows it to be tilted to the west, where there is a hot iron channel. Slag is poured into the channel and shunted into two large iron waste bins to the north and south. When pouring gold, the channel is opened to run to the west to fill a mold that has many small cavities for forming up to 16 small, 10-ounce ingots of gold. Any surplus and splashed gold is picked up and tossed back into the crucible. The floor to the west of this operation is littered with heaps of slag near the walls. There is a 10-foot-wide clear space down the center of the tunnel. The slag is not removed from the mine, as it would give away the fact that it is operating and producing bullion.

Presently, they have cast 16 ingots and are pouring the last batch of molten gold to make eight more. Two gray dwarves are standing by to carry the cooled ingots to the chief, who in turn conveys them to Thaarl Goldhand, the aberrant elder xorn. When characters enter, they immediately face the two salamanders and the two gray dwarves.

The salamanders attack as soon as they can reach the intruders and without tactical considerations. The two gray dwarves shout loudly for help as they become invisible. Their noise brings the four dwarves currently mining in the shaft to the east. On the second round after willing invisibility, if not attacked, the two will create the illusion of eight of their fellows coming into the area on the run, one squad from the northeast tunnel entrance and one from the southwest tunnel entrance.


###### 147


The Environs of Yggsburgh

On the third round after the characters enter the room, the four miners exit invisibly from the shaft, and each creates a phantasmal duplicate that heads for the melee at fastest speed. In the meantime, they slowly move towards the combat and join the battle if their illusions are ignored. Otherwise they continue to regenerate the illusions.

1. **Mine This is an area of current active digging. A vein of gold is being followed by the gray dwarves.
###### Concluding the Adventure

If the characters wish to claim the Abounding Lode mine, the Castle Keeper should allow it, if that suits their plans. The characters will need to find a boss miner and crew to do the digging, unless they plan to mine it themselves. A boss miner can be located in Yggsburgh and will insist that, before taking on the job, the claim be registered in Yggsburgh to prevent continual attempts by claim jumpers to take over the diggings.

Registering their claim can cost anywhere from 1gp to 25gp, at the option of the Castle Keeper. The location of the claim and name of the mine will be recorded along with the owner’s name and place of residence. The recording clerk will explain that all gold—nuggets, dust, bullion or raw ore mined—must be sent to the refinery in Yggsburgh to be handled. Payment for shipments will be at 90% of value for .999 fine gold, less additional processing costs, if any. This can be as high as 50% of the value for raw ore, or as little as 10% for nuggets and dust. Ingots will be assayed and paid at 90% of their actual gold content. Failure to send a monthly shipment of gold to the town will result in cancellation of the claim rights, and the town then owns those rights. Otherwise, Yggsburgh stands ready to enforce the owners’ rights whenever needed, using its military to do so if necessary.

The mine yields to the owner a net of 40-160gp per month for every miner (up to a maximum of 15) working it. The mine boss steals only the moderate amount of 25gp a month. The miners steal much less, perhaps 1sp worth each. It seemingly plays out in 5d10 months of time. Only a mining engineer, or dwarf or gnome miner, will be able to locate new veins of ore. If hired, they can return the mine to 50% normal yield for a period of 6-60 years—it being an excellent mine overall.

#### The Unnamed Island


**Location: The River Nemo

**Encounter **Chart:** River

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: River Nemo, Yggsburgh

The Unnamed Island is about 10 miles upstream from Yggsburgh. It is said to be a place where dark forces gather on moonless nights. This is likely a tall tale to explain the fog that tends to form over the island on such nights. But sometimes, visible in this murky blanket are strange lights that dance and pulse, and passing boatmen have heard eerie sounds that might have been chanting coming from the place. That demon worshipers gather there to perform obscene rites and offer sacrifices to their nether masters is most doubtful, although there are many unexplained disappearances in the area. In all cases this island is given a wide berth, and normal folk shun treading on it, and do not name it for fear of attracting the attention of the evil ones.

###### Adventure Hook

This adventure will take much effort on the part of the Castle Keeper. The Castle Keeper is to prepare the actual adventure material and the opponents’ statistics for this encounter. As this can be quite an extensive adventure, the undertaking will be no mean effort but will ultimately greatly increase the abilities of the Castle Keeper to prepare and run adventures of his own in this setting.

Should the characters venture to the island on a moonless night, they will discover an evil cleric is calling up shadows that wander around in search of something. The cleric is trying to ascertain the whereabouts of the hidden tomb of an ancient lich. He is doing so in order to gain that monster’s treasure for himself, for this cleric has discovered that amongst the horde is a potent malign artifact of evil that will empower him greatly.

The Castle Keeper should consider that the motivation for seeking the relic might well extend beyond personal aggrandizement. The cleric might be the chief agent of some powerful noble bent on conquest of the area, or usurping power in Yggsburgh itself.

#### Swift Currents


**Location: Urt River

**Encounter **Chart:** River

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Urt River, Menhir Hills, Greypools Mire

Where the Urt River narrows, near the morass of the Greypools Mire and north, are areas of great danger. Their unusual inhabitants raid unchecked causing havoc for all who dare these waterways.

###### Adventure Hooks

Somewhere up the Urt, deep in the Menhir Hills, there is reported to be the lair of a most awful water giant. Now it is laying in wait for, and attacking, the small boats that dare the swift current of the river, wrecking them and devouring the people on board. These reports come from dwarves who have fled the area because of this fierce monster. Can the characters locate the water giant, find its lair and defeat it? Alternately, can they convince it to quit


with its wanton destruction and allow fishermen to ply its trade? The Castle Keeper should prepare appropriate encounters, and a lair, should the characters undertake this adventure.

Water Giant _(This _chaotic _eeil _creature’s _eital _stats _are: _HD_ _9d12, HP 75, AC 20. Its prime attributes are: physical. It cau attack with two large fists for 3d6+6 damage, a giaut club for_ _2d12+6 damage or by hurliug rocks for 5d6 damage. Special: The_ _water _giaut _cau _breathe _uuderwater _for _6 _hours _before _ueediug _to_ _come _up _for _more _oxygeu.)_

Not far upriver, somewhere near the place it passes the Greypools Mire, storytellers relate that there is a sunken ship that has lain on the bottom of the Urt River for centuries. It is supposedly a raider vessel filled with riches, which was sunk with all of its reaving crew by an outraged demigoddess for their daring to have sacked and burned her fane. No one has sought to locate the wreck, because of the curse the deity put upon both it and any who seek to gain its wealth for themselves.

The Castle Keeper is to prepare the actual adventure material and such opponents’ statistics as are appropriate for the encounter. Several creatures in the Orders of Battle may be appropriate for such encounters. It could be that ghosts of the crewmen are haunting the river or protecting their “tomb,” or even doing the bidding of some greater being who has come to reside here.

#### Snails, Shells and Minnows


**Location: Meadow Creek

**Encounter **Chart: Stream

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Meadow Creek, River Nemo

In this small but notable stream are said to be a living in the upper reaches of this waterway a rare kind of fish. These are all but invisible fish; little creatures are who many claim to be of fairy sort, magical and intelligent.

###### Adventure Hook

Rumors of the magical fish living in this stream should attract any curious character. And the fish here are indeed magical. The minnows dwelling in the upper reaches of the river are all but invisible and intelligent. If caught, they can change themselves into a seemingly inanimate object such as a pebble or snail shell. Or so the rumors go. Whatever the case, if that or other ruses fail, the captive minnow resumes its own form and answers three questions of its captor, if a promise to be released and allowed to live is given. The knowledge possessed by one of these fabulous minnows is claimed to be vast.

Could it be the fish are lying? Are others in the region looking for the magical minnows? Are they protected by other fey? The Castle Keeper should prepare the actual material for this encounter and determine the amount of knowledge known by the minnows.

#### Witches and Waterways


**Location: False Urt River

**Encounter **Chart:** River

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: False Urt River, Greypools Mire, Urt River

This sluggish waterway is the subject of many rumors and tales. Many are easily discounted, others are not. What nature of beast or evil creature lurks along banks overgrown with willow bushes few can say with accuracy, but one can accurately say anyone who decides to find out is indeed brave.

###### Adventure Hook

Old wives’ tales claim that the False Urt River was created long ago by a potent witch, so as to lure unsuspecting waterfarers into the Greypools Mire. There, they were drowned or else killed by the witch and her vile servants. Although the original witch is said to have died decades ago, it is told that her daughter now roams the waterway, doing her mother’s fell work.

The Castle Keeper is to prepare the actual adventure material and opponents’ statistics for this encounter, keeping in mind the characters’ levels and capabilities. Whether or not a witch can even be found in this region is left up to the Castle Keeper. At the very least, though, keep the mystery alive.

#### Fish and Savage Reptiles


**Location: Big Fish Lake

###### Encounter Chart: **Lake**

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Garham, Mound Island

Big Fish Lake is located near Garham. It is well-known for its big fish. Eels and lampreys of incredible size menace the lake. Where do fish of such size come from? Though rumors abound, few know the actual truth of the matter. What is known is that the lake is not an altogether safe place and at one time, in days past, a great army of savage reptilemen once dwelled here.

###### Adventure Hooks

Fable has it that at the deepest part of this lake there is a great artifact, a sampo that periodically produces a random elixir. It is said to be a draught that extends life, or perhaps conveys good health, and maybe even a potion that causes increase in size. These magical liquids being discharged into the lake’s waters are what have caused the creatures dwelling therein to grow so large, demonstrate such vitality, and live for decades if not killed by predators such as fishermen.

Will the characters brave the waters of the Bigfish Lake to find the sampo? Is there even a sampo here? What guards this object and why would it be here? The Castle Keeper should decide these and other issues before the characters embark on their mission of discovery.

There is said to be an underwater cave not far below the surface of the lake’s south shore. The cave is claimed to lead to an extensive underground lake, and from thence upwards into a cavern complex underneath the Lakepens Hills. This place was once the

###### The Environs of Yggsburgh



home of a great tribe of reptilemen, but because of their attacks on the humans nearby these savage creatures were exterminated in a long war. Now all the hidden places are empty save for monstrous things.

#### Disappearances and Labyrinths


**Location: North Eel River

**Encounter **Chart: River

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: North Eel River, South Eel River, Menhir Hills, Bigfish Lake, Fallsford

The North Eel River flows fast out of the Menhir Hills and empties into the Bigfish Lake. Its lower reaches are inhabited by the same giant fish and aquatic animals found in the Bigfish Lake, but it is home to much more than this. Its tangled banks conceal many strange creatures, and its upper reaches, far in the Menhir Hills, harbor even more.

###### Adventure Hooks

The frightening tales told about the phantom that haunts the banks of this river are likely no more than tall tales, and disappearances of persons in this area are ascribed to accidental drownings. This spirit is said to wander North Eel River to frighten away mortals, so that they do not fall into clutches of the terrible green hag that has her lair in the North Eel River. The Castle Keeper should decide where the Green Hag resides and what part, if any, the spirit has to play in the affairs along the river. The Castle Keeper is strongly encouraged to determine the specifics of this encounter; however, a suggested Green Hag is statted below.

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

Green Hag _(This creatures eital stats are: HD 6d8, HP 37, AC_ _17, chaotic eeil. Its prime attributes are: physical.

Far upriver, where the Menhir Hills are near to being mountains, gnome miners are reported to have struck a great vein of gold intermixed with platinum. In their efforts to find more such wealth, however, these demi-humans are said to have broken into a labyrinth of natural caves, the subterranean inhabitants of which decimated the gnomes and drove the survivors out of the area. There is a clan of dwarves willing to go investigate, and take over the diggings if they have heroes with them to assist in fighting whatever fell creatures might be in the mine. They will pay no less than 2,500gp if there is indeed such a mine, and give a bounty of 50 to 500gp, depending on the ferocity of each monster found therein and slain by the party members.

The Castle Keeper must determine both the make-up of the dwarven miners and the monsters that have driven out the gnomes. Use of the Orders of Battle Appendix, Dwarves, should be helpful, as would any of the other humanoid Order of Battle tables. Further, use of the random encounter table may also be useful.

#### Barges, Beavers and Tavern Tales


**Location:** South Eel River

**Encounter **Chart:** River

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: South Eel River, Bigfish Lake, Garham

The South Eel River is busy with barge and boat traffic, moving to and from Garham with goods of all types. Though not quite the same size, the same fish found in Bigfish Lake are often found here as well. However, it is not only boats and barges that move along this river. Dangerous and terrifying creatures are said to dwell here, and fishermen keep an eye out for strange goings-on.

###### Adventure Hook

Tales told in taverns in Garham and the surrounding area sometimes concern an otter-were dwelling along the banks of this great river. In stories related by those who have met it, this creature is described as a great animal which can change itself into a human. It is described as a trickster who


deceived them into doing it a favor and, in exchange, promised to lead them to a hidden cache of wealth—but never did.

This is no otter-were, and it would be wrong to associate with those other creatures of the “were” family such as the werewolf or jackelwere. This is a magical otter, the origins of which are lost to all. It uses fishermen and others to do its bidding. What it bids the characters to do is left up to the Castle Keeper.

#### The Curse of Blessing


**Location: Cress Brook

**Encounter **Chart: Stream

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Cress Brook, South Eel River, Richwood Forest, North East Uplands

This small brook is renowned for the watercress and trout caught in its fresh waters. Some elves are believed to live in the vicinity of the creek. But there are also rumors and tales of the creeks magical blessings but, the story warns that there are also curses accrued with the blessings. These tales bring many a traveler to this remote area.

###### Adventure Hook

Legend claims that the brook’s waters are magical. If a person bathes in them on a certain night of the year, the waters convey magical properties to the bather. The person bathing in the creek receives protective powers, such that they receive a 21 armor class no matter the armor they are wearing. It also confers an 18 dexterity upon the person. And that lucky individual is also able to see in total darkness. Along with these blessings comes a curse. These benefits are balanced by an aura around the person such that all evil creatures can see them clearly, day or night. This radiance causes the malign to be incensed and attack, unremittingly, the one shedding the aura. These effects last for one month only.

#### The Nereid’s Warning


**Location: Cold Springs Run

**Encounter **Chart: Stream

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Cold Springs Run, River Nemo, Salamander Creek, Glittering Knobs

The navigable portion of the small creek is crowded with boat traffic ferrying supplies to the various encampments of miners in the Glittering Knobs as well as bringing back precious cargoes of gold, silver and gems. But what of the upper, non-navigable portions? What lies beyond?

###### Adventure Hook

An old gaffer’s tale tells of a nereid dwelling in the largest of the spring pools at the headwaters of the Cold Springs Run. She is said to be there to guard the burial place of a wingless dragon or serpent of most terrible aspect. She commands any wanderers in the area to stay away, lest they bring the creature back to life.

Should it be decided that this rumor is true, the Castle Keeper should prepare beforehand the place of burial, what guards it and the nature of the serpent aroused should the characters not take the advice and warnings of nereid.

#### Services and Rewards


**Location: Greypools Mire

**Encounter **Chart: Marsh

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Greypools Mire, False Urt River

This broad marshland is dotted with small and large ponds. Some are shallow and others deep, but all have soft muddy bottoms that swallow up those unfortunate enough to fall into them. This is only one of the dangers of the Greypools Mire. It is inhabited by many ferocious and dangerous creatures of evil bent and malign spirit. Travel here is fraught with many dangers so great care and planning are a must.

###### The Environs of Yggsburgh

###### Adventure Hook

Folk tales claim that one of the large pools is the home of a community of fairy folk. Though difficult to find, anyone bringing these water-dwelling wee folk gifts of a useful sort are welcomed and given rich rewards for their trouble.

The Castle Keeper should develop the nature of this encounter to include the location of the community and the make-up of its inhabitants. The wandering monster table for marshes should supply ample challenging encounters, and adventures aplenty for any party attempting to reach the fairies.

#### Hauntings and Hillocks


**Location: Great Leech Marsh **Encounter Chart:** Marsh **Map Reference:** 24

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Great Leech Marsh

Thick with thorny trees and marsh grasses, mires and pools of soft mud, even moving through this place is dangerous. Combined with the marsh’s many monstrous inhabitants, it becomes deadly.

###### Adventure Hook

There is said to be a barrow, a haunted tomb, in the marsh. Rumor places it near Bigfish Lake, on a strangely-shaped hillock amongst the many low rises of dry ground in the morass. What might have caused the strangely-shaped hillock? Is there some animal responsible for it? Or is the mound just the earth covering some ancient, eldritch burial site?

The Castle Keeper must develop this barrow as needed and provide answers for all the questions the characters may devise. The one certainty is that it is not here by accident.

#### Rooting Out Truffles


**Location: Wynchwood Forest

**Encounter **Chart:** Wynchwood

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Ashwood, Bald Hills, Menhir Hills

The Wynchwood is an enchanted place! It is named for a tribe of ancient folk who dwelled in and around it long ago, the people calling themselves the Wycce. The Wychwood is best known for its two widely differing aspects. First and foremost, its principal inhabitants are of sylvan sort such as satyrs, silini (human upper torso, pony lower torso), stacentaurs (deer-bodied centaurs), centaurs, and bucentaurs (bull-bodied centaure). There are many other creatures living in this forest who are of unusual sort.

Second, and of commercial note, are the fungus beds that grows underground within it. These are truffles, and are knows as “black silver” as their wholesale value is the same as silver, ounce for ounce. A number of daring freemen with trained swine venture into the Wychwood Forest’s verge to locate and root out the truffles locate therein. An average single find brings forth about three pounds of the fungus worth about 20gpto the right buyers. Few pickers or woodcutters dare to venture into the heart of the woodland where the exotic fruits and desirable species of timber to be felled are located.

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

###### Adventure Hook 1

The small Trufflers’ Brotherhood of Yggsburgh is asking for up to 10 mercenary guards of exceptional ability, to protect them against attacks by satyrs and other forest denizens while they are seeking truffles. The pay is 25gp per person, per day, plus any loot taken from attackers. What they really want is a force to go into the woodland and exterminate its inhabitants, so they can take more truffles and their associates dealing in timber can freely harvest the rare trees. Of course, it would take an army backed up by potent wizards and priests to accomplish that, but these merchants are not aware of that.

The Castle Keeper should manage this adventure by having a wood elf of friendly nature approach the party, and warn them not to get involved in a fight with the creatures of the forest. If they listen and leave, on their way out of the woods they will find a gold broach in the shape of pan pipes–the Syrinx of Sylvan Summoning (see Magic Items Appendix). If the characters decide to seek out and attack the forest’s inhabitants, they will encounter first a band of 12 satyrs, then 12 silini, then 6 stacentaurs, then 6 centaurs and then 6 bucentaurs. If those five groups are defeated, then repeat the sequence, this time with half again as many of each creature attacking. If the party succeeds in defeating all of those assailants, they have succeeded in making the area safe for truffle hunters for the next five years!

###### Adventure Hook 2

While in the Wychwood Forest the party sees a hamadryad pleading with several woodcutters. These men are intent upon felling her home tree. What will the characters do?

This particular hamadryad is in desperate straits because the leader of the woodcutters has an Amulet of Counter-Enthralling (see Magic Items appendix). As a result, all the hamadryad’s attempts to captivate or fascinate the woodcutters have failed. So her tree is about to be cut down by the woodsmen and her life ended. The woodcutters will not heed her pleas, as they want the tree and the treasures within it. The hamadryad cannot physically attack the woodsmen, as she has no effective weapons and an axe blow upon her tree will disrupt her spell casting and concentration (this already happened when she attempted to use her magic against them). There are several cuts in the great oak’s bole already. If the characters intervene and save her tree, the hamadryad will give each of them a kiss which will increase that character’s charisma by 1 point. This magic only affects those characters with a charisma score of 16 or less.

Inside the bowl of the tree are 30 gemstones of red and green hues. Each is worth 50-200gp.

#### Red Bill and the Filthy Orcs


**Location: Little Hillwood

**Encounter **Chart:** Woods

**Zagyg Adventure Reference:** Little Hillwood, Menhir Hills, False Urt River, Urt River, Greypools Mire, Old Castle Track

This woodland is a dangerous place. Where it borders the Menhir Hills Road to the west, the Little Hillwood serves as a lair and hiding place for human robbers and humanoid reavers alike. For this reason, and the fact that there is nothing but danger along its course, the Old Castle Track that enters the forest’s south central portion is shunned by all sensible persons.

###### Adventure Hook

The party comes upon a group of brigands that are encamped in a hidden dell. Their guards detect the interlopers, but welcome them, evidently mistaking the characters for some tough and able reinforcements their leader is expecting. The chief of the robber band, Red Bill Farmer, greets the most able-looking fighter in the party, saying: “Damme, but you must be ‘Savage Wilk.’ No one else would dare to have such a band of villainous cutthroats with him. How did you get here so quick? No matter, it’s a wonder you found this place at all. Come on, let’s have some drink and discuss how best to attack and kill those filthy gnoles that have been cutting into my band’s rightful prey!” The Castle Keeper should change the gnoles to another humanoid band if needed.

The brigand captain then describes the enemy, the location of their village encampment, and his plan of attack. Will the party manage to pull off an impersonation of a band of dangerous criminals? Will they join in the assault? Will they try to sneak away in the night? There are many options involved in this scenario, including the later appearance of demi-humans or humanoids drawn to the fight by the noise…

###### The Brigands

The group size and level range of the brigands are left up to the Castle Keeper. However, the following group is provided if needed. The captain of the band is the ruthless outlaw Red Bill Farmer and his faithless lieutenant Jocko. Their spiritual advisor in badness is Demon Harv, and they also have with them The Flash, a wizard with a pyromaniac bent.

###### Wood Elves

A band of wood elves is in the vicinity. It is up to the Castle Keeper to decide if the wood elves hear the sounds of battle and come to investigate. The size and level range of the band should be altered to fit the party’s level. The wood elves are led by Aldion Ashgrove and his advisor Trintolan Yarrow. They are aided by their lieutenant, Valitas Ferret.

#### Assignations and Assassinations


**Location: Great Hillwood

**Encounter **Chart: Wooded Hills

**Zagyg Adventure Reference:** Great Hillwood, Menhir Hills Road, Castle Gaxhill, Stonewyck, Sir Alec, Lord Mayor of Yggsburgh

Within the mighty forest of the Great Hillwood, with its massive oaks and pleasant meadows, lies Castle Gaxhill. Traveling along the Menhir Hills Road brings one to the southern edge of this forest some 50 or more miles from Yggsburgh. Just at the verge of the vast woodland, perched atop a steep rocky upthrust to the east of the road, there is the small fortress of Castle Gaxhill— the stronghold of an independent knight—and the town of Stonewyck.

###### Adventure Hooks

1. Sir Alec is not sworn as a liegeman of the Free Town of Yggsburgh. The Lord Mayor Druid Lochinvar Beechwood summons the party to an audience, asks if they can travel north to the knight’s manor, and convince Sir Alec to pay a visit to the town and pledge his fealty to it, thus strengthening Yggsburgh and his own position—according to the mayor. To make the offer more attractive, His Lordship says he will appoint Sir Alec to the office of Steward of all Yggsburgh’s territory. This is a new office, ranking just below the Lord Mayor in precedence and bearing with it an annual stipend of 3,000gp. Will the adventurers undertake this embassy? If so, they might well earn the enmity of both town Councilmen, Sir Donald Kark and Sir Charles Thornly. Each of these two aristocrats believes he deserves the position, not to mention the other knights of the free town!

If the team succeeds in bringing Sir Alec to the town, an assassination attempt will be made on the knight. That will make convincing him to become a liegeman of the town’s lord mayor more difficult. Suspicion will fall on his fellow cavaliers in regard to the attempted murder, but if the team investigates it, it is likely they discover that the assassin was hired by one of the three neighboring nobles, intent on making Yggsburgh a part of their respective domains. Success for the adventurers will mean elevation, with commoners amongst their number given coats of arms and made gentlemen. Characters of gentle birth will be styled “esquire,” and any that are knighted at the time will be made Knights of the Order of the Citadel, the highest ranking order of the Free Town of Yggsburgh.

Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

#### Sepulchral Tones


**Location: Oldoaks Grove

**Encounter **Chart: Wooded Hills

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Oldoaks Grove, Menhir Hills, Lord Mayor of Yggsburgh

Deep in the Menhir Hills, hidden among the ancient and massive trees of this forest lies a bowl-shaped valley. Four times a year, the region’s highest ranking Druid, Lochinvar Beechwood, the Lord Mayor of Yggsburgh, comes to hold the sacred ceremonies of that faith for the worshipers of the region. The Oldoaks Grove is now the center for the Druidical faith.

1. The center of the Oldoaks Grove is marked by a huge tree that has a black lightning scar on its bole, running down to the roots from a place where the trunk divides into four branches. Once the characters have located and are within the circle of the grove, they cannot find their way out. Should they try to leave, it seems as if they are leaving, but no matter what direction they travel, they end up back in the heart of the place where the lightning- scarred tree grows.

If the characters spend the night here, a ghastly phantom visage appears. It speaks to the characters in hollow, sepulchral tones telling them that they are doomed, will never leave this place of death, and their souls will be bound to the grove eternally. After it disappears, the characters will see ghostly forms amongst the trees, all appearing lost and in anguish. Of course, they must discover what is keeping them in the grove and how to break its power so as to allow them to leave. The exact nature of the conundrum is left up to the Castle Keeper and should be detailed as desired. Perhaps it is the spirit of an ancient druid who turned from nature to evil, made human sacrifices to the dark powers and was struck down by lightning for his terrible crimes. Although dead physically, his malign spirit remains and is able to wield magical spells. To destroy such a creature the characters would need to find his remains, destroy them by fire, and then possibly use exorcism or some hallowing spell on the scarred oak to remove his spirit from it.

#### The Drumbeat of War


**Location: Westfields

**Encounter Chart: Open Grasslands

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Westfields, River Nemo, Ashwood, Sir Donald Kark, Sir Charles Thornly, Sir Reynard Montjoy, Sir Bertram Trillingby

**Towns **of **Note: Villages of the Westfields, Yggsburgh

The fertile plains of the Westfields are home to many freehold and socman farmers, and also contain the manors and holdings of four noblemen from Yggsburgh. Sir Donald Kark, Sir Charles Thornly, Sir Reynard Montjoy and Sir Bertram Trillingby all have fortified manor houses in the Westfields, and it is upon these four noblemen that much of the responsibility for the area’s defense and policing lies. Though currently peaceful with only few minor disturbances, the politics of Yggsburgh often spill over into the Westfields, with ofttimes disastrous results.


###### Adventure Hook

Reports reach the area that a fleet of small ships has passed Dunfalcon and is heading up the River Nemo to raid and pillage the countryside. This means that at least 200 barbarian warriors will be here in perhaps a week, or even less time. Unless the raiders are met and defeated before they get a foothold, they will build a fortified base camp, steal horses, and proceed to attack and plunder the countryside virtually unchecked.

The knights in the Westfields are quarreling and so none are willing to cooperate in a concerted attack against the invading force when it lands. What can the party of adventurers do to convince the nobles to set aside their differences and act in concert? If they refuse to work together, their lands will be stripped of their wealth, of course, the communities ransacked and burned, and not a few of their folk carried off as captives and likely sold into slavery. If the characters do succeed in uniting the four knights, what can they do to both assure a victory and mitigate the losses bound to occur to the local force? Possible tactics include ambush, the use of war engines, and recruiting elves from Ashwood.

A review of the “Villages of the Westfields” located in “Garham, Villages and Thorps” (Section II, Part Three) should be used in preparing adventures in this region.

###### The Barbarian Raiders

There are two groups of barbarian raiders. The first is under the leadership of Jarl Vungard Bloodhand, and his aide Ulrich Wotanskald. The second is commanded by Jarl Arnie the Wolf, and his aide Bjorn Thorsmann. In the ship of each of the two commanders there is an iron chest containing 30-300 gems worth 20-80gp each, and 20-80 pieces of jewelry worth 50-2,000gp. There is also 2,000-8,000gp and 10,000-40,000sp.

#### Settlers and Burrows


**Location: Lonely Valley

**Encounter Chart: Open Grasslands

**Zagyg Adventure Reference:** Lonely Valley, Menhir Hills, Yggsburgh, Green Ridge, Urt River, The Gnome Burrows, Garham, Jolly Fisherman, Green Friends Clan, Yggsburgh College Library

**Villages **of **Note: Garham

The lonely valley has no roads leading in or out of it. Its lands are unsettled by the farmers of Yggsburgh and few humans are likely to be seen here. The only folk that dwell in proximity to the Lonely Valley are (were–see below) a clan of gnomes who have their burrows in the hills at the valley’s north central edge and a tribe of elves in the woods at the south end. Neither group welcomes humans, for if settlers come into the place everything will change drastically. The lord mayor of Yggsburgh would have it otherwise if he could thinking that the addition of a road and a few villages, two or three knights and Yggsburgh becomes that much stronger and more wealthy.

###### Adventure Hook

What brings the characters to the Lonely Valley? Perhaps the Lord Mayor requests that the characters survey the Lonely Valley for a likely spot to begin building a village, or sends them to make arrangement with the gnomes and elves for settlement rights? Whatever the case, the characters are unlikely to be received well by the elves, or at all by the gnomes (see below).

###### The Gnome Burrows

The exact location of this place is left in the hands of the Castle Keeper. The burrows are generally in the hills at the west edge of Lonely Valley. What is around the location can be whatever the Castle Keeper wishes. This is very much a dungeon crawl, with little in the way of role-play, and very much exploration with some hack and slash thereafter. What heroic party would really want to spend time chatting with a bunch of murderous goblins anyway? So let your players have at it in this action-filled scenario.

###### The Environs of Yggsburgh

Information regarding the Gnome Burrows can be gained in any of the following ways:

**Lonely Valley:** When meeting and conversing with any persons dwelling in or familiar with the Lonely Valley, the person will comment that the tribe of friendly gnomes that dwelled in the west central hills bordering the valley seems to have gone elsewhere, and that wild animals now make the area dangerous.

**Jolly Fisherman:** When in conversation in the Jolly Fisherman ale house in Garham, and the subject of gnomes, herbs, or the Lonely Valley comes up, information can be gained. An individual comments that the gnomes who inhabit a burrow at the valley’s western verge have become hostile and won’t allow anyone near there anymore, so it is dangerous to go there. They think something is definitely wrong.

**Green Friends Clan:** If the characters are friendly with any gnome dwelling in the area, they express concern that something bad has happened to the Green Friends Clan that dwells in the Lonely Valley. Why? Because the gnome has heard whispered remarks amongst his fellows that the Green Friends would never have willingly ceased trading their herbs and minerals for the many goods they got from the town.

**Yggsburgh **Herb **Suppliers: When discussing rare herbs with any supplier of same in Yggsburgh, that individual will complain that since the gnomes of Lonely Valley have stopped trading in the town, it is difficult to get some kinds of rare herbs, and quality is not as high as those from the local gnome growers.

**Yggsburgh Spell Component Suppliers:** When discussing spell components with any supplier of the same in Yggsburgh, the proprietor mutters in passing that since the gnomes of the Lonely Valley quit sending their mineral components to the town, magnetite and pyrite are difficult to come by.

**Yggsburgh College Libray:** If researching in the Yggsburgh College library regarding non-human occupants of the area, the following entry will be discovered in a text dealing with demi- human groups in the vicinity of the town:

_Of _fairly _recent _introduction _into _the _region _is _a _clan_ _of gnomes who call themselves the Green Friends. They _are _mainly _agriculturists _that _cultivate _herbs of all kinds, but are especially known for their ability to grow rare herbs of exceptional potency. The _clan _is _small _and _reclusive. _The _location _of _their burrow is northwest of the Town of Yggsburgh, in the area known as the Lonely Valley._

###### For the Castle Keeper

The gnome clan of the Green Friends numbered only 12 families, with 56 members and a bachelor association of 24 members. With their chief and his family, the clan priest and his family and warrior guards, the total number came to around 100 clansmen. Despite their small number, the clan was prosperous and lived well. In addition to their herbal crops, the gnomes had discovered an excellent source of magnetite (lodestone) and pyrite, so they became relatively wealthy trading these goods.

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

Being insular in their outlook and averse to general fraternization with any persons not of gnomish heritage, the Green Friends enjoyed their isolated location and kept all strangers, including other gnomes, away. This led to their undoing in the recent past. A tribe of wandering goblins made their way through the Menhir Hills undetected by humans or gnomes, and noted the rich conditions of the Little Hillwood and Long Forest timberlands, as well as the lushness and game in the Lonely Valley. In seeking a hidden place to make their own, the goblins discovered the burrows of the Green Friends Clan. As the leaders of these humanoids were clever, they spied on the gnomes carefully before making their move. When they struck, the goblins ambushed sentries, taking prisoner many gnomes who were working in the herb gardens, and then used their captives to gain entrance to the burrows. The gnomes were soon totally subdued and then killed.

The goblin chief was so pleased with his success that he named his band the Green Slayers, and their emblem is now a gnome skull dyed green. However, because the goblins are few in number now, the chief has elected to enlist many wererats into his force.

The shaman was also quite happy, as he discovered the means of summoning a will-o’-wisp amidst the booty taken from the demi- humans. A special potion was discovered that gave the shaman the means to control a summoned will-o’-wisp. It is a gnomish potion made from rare herbs. He regrets being unable to make new batches of the magical draught but keeps on experimenting, the only results so far being three dead members of the band.

The main objective for the party is rather straightforward and violent. Get into the complex, and wipe out all of the goblins and their associated number. To make the victory complete, they need to make known what they have done after accomplishing the extermination of the vile goblins. This will gain the party some renown and make them popular with all demi-humans, and gnomes in particular.

If you wish, the scenario can be modified to allow for dissension within the goblin clan, there is a sub-chief who can be established as the head of a rebel force that will possibly fight with the characters against the other goblins if they play things correctly. This optional approach is introduced and explained in pertinent encounter areas. You are free to employ it or not, but if the party is not particularly strong, it is the best way to provide a fair chance for their succeeding in the challenging series of confrontations they face.

If the party is of relatively high level, simply increase the number and/or level of goblins and other denizens of this place. In all cases where goblins are receiving a bonus to damage, that same bonus applies to the attack die roll.

###### The Burrows

###### Composition of the Burrows

The Green Friends dug their home into a hillside composed of limestone with pockets of soil. Those areas of the underground complex excavated from earth are indicated hereafter in the encounter areas.


**Tunnels:** All five-foot-wide shafts have rough-hewn floors and walls, as well as an arched ceiling eight feet above the floor at its apex.

**Doors:** Single doors are of iron-banded oak, two inches thick. Each is two-and-a-half feet wide and five feet high. All open inward and have an iron bolt to lock them. Double doors are studded and iron-banded oak, two-and-a-half inches thick. Each is three-and-a-half feet wide and seven feet high. All open inwards, have an iron bolt, and a wooden bar to lock them.

**P: These are privy rooms with several accommodations. The waste shafts run some 40 feet down to the channel of an underground stream.

**Approach to the Entrance** The area surrounding the entrance is sparsely wooded, with clumps of low foliage and bushes. The terrain is somewhat rocky and hilly, with many small ridges and swales that cut line of sight considerably. As the party moves through here they notice small paths in the dirt, something like deer trails, but not made by hoofed animals. A ranger notes small footprints of demi-human and humanoid sort. The various paths lead away to nothing in the west and north, to overgrown garden patches in the east, and to a slightly broader path leading off southwards into the open land of the valley. Backtracking along the paths leads to Area 1.

1. **Entrance **to **the **Gnome **Burrows The well-beaten path leads to the location where it seemingly dead ends against a sloping rock set into the side of a low hill covered with scrub. The rock slab is counter-weighted, so that a strong pull upon its lower edge causes it to swing upwards to reveal an opening six feet high and five feet wide, and stairs leading down into the rock beyond.

The party will arrive either during the day or night. Each arrival is described separately below.

###### Daylight Arrival

As the party comes close to examine the slab of stone, four gnomes concealed in the bushes flanking the rock stand up with short bows at the ready, demanding to know what strangers dare to trespass on the lands of the Green Friends Clan.

The characters may notice that these demi-humans are rather beady-eyed and sharp-faced for gnomes, and that they are nervous and twitchy. Observant characters see that something is wrong.

These sentries are not eager to engage in conversation, but if the party appears tough and determined, they will speak at some length. In general, they demand that the intruders leave, that their clan is in mourning over the death of its chief, and no one not of the clan can enter the burrows.

They are lying, of course. These gnomish wererats attack if the party is aggressive. These creatures will fight until two are dead, then the two remaining flee at their fastest speed up the hill into

the scrub. If they escape, the two enter the escape passage on the north side of the hill, which is disguised as a fox’s den (see Area 2). They will not alert the goblins, because they are cowardly and not loyal in the least.

###### Night Arrival

There are two gnome wererats on guard at night. They watch from the bushes while a will-o’-wisp glows steadily as if it were a magic lantern. It is located about 10 feet above the entrance to the burrows. Each wererat sentinel has an attack-trained wolverine with it. When anyone approaches, they ready their bows and demand the intruders step into the light. Upon seeing a party of adventurers, the guards order the will-o’-wisp and wolverines down to attack, loose their arrows, change to rat form and join the melee. They feel confident of their strength, so they will fight to the end.

Rebel Faction Plot: In either case, if the “rebel faction” plot is being used, the gnome wererats are not loyal to the chief but back the sub-chief, because he was not the one responsible for making them what they are now. Thus, if one of these creatures is captured, or surrounded and given a chance to speak so as to save its life, the wererat tells the adventurers of the rebel sub-chief, urges the characters to go to the right upon entering the burrows, take the second, short passage to the left thereafter, and knock on the door there, calling out they are “friends come to assist in overthrowing the goblin chief.” The wererats will swear they are telling the truth, and they are, of course.

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

1. **Stairway:** These stone steps lead northeast from Area 1 twenty-five feet down to a passage leading north and a branch leading southeast.

The steps in the north passage, accessed by the entrance steps, lead first east then north for a distance of 30 feet. The area directly in front of these steps is flagstone, not hewn rock, indicating that there was earth here, and the initial course of the stairway is of laid limestone risers. This stairway leads to a corridor that runs north beneath the upper level of the burrows to Area 5, and from there goes due north 130 feet. At that distance, the stone passage becomes a clay-walled tunnel of three- foot width and five-foot height, gradually lessening to two-foot width and three-foot height as it runs another 40 feet. At its end is a heavy wooden door with a latch that requires great dexterity to open. The door is concealed in what appears to be an abandoned fox’s den (see Area 1 above). The seeming fox hole is actually the back door to the burrows.

1. **Goblin Guard Room** This 20’ x 25’ room has an 8’ high ceiling. This door is open, with a sentry standing just outside the room but not in the passage. The sentinel is not particularly alert, so the chance for surprising him is normal, but if he is able to act, he will shout an alarm to his comrades in the room. A shout and the noise of combat alerts the goblins in Area 4 as well. It will take the goblins in Area 4 ten rounds to arm and put on armor, then they will exit and head south to the corridor to assail the intruders, or see what has happened to their comrades in this room.

There are a table and four chairs in the room, a bench against the west wall facing the door, and a rack of 12 short spears to either side of the bench. A water barrel holding 60 gallons is in the northwest corner of the place.

Tactics: The guards fight until dead. This is because they are cornered, and know that if they surrender and the intruders are later defeated, the chief of their clan will have them skinned alive. When a foe is in the doorway or inside the room, the serjeant will hurl a burning, hooded oil lantern over the attacker in the entrance to hit an intruder behind him, then the goblin joins the melee.

1. **Barracks** This 5’ x 30’ room has an 8’ high ceiling. Off-duty goblin guards rest here. The goblins in here are just arising to get ready for their duties, so they will not have armor on if surprised. If they hear an alarm, or the sound of fighting, they will have their armor on in 10 rounds’ time.

There are eight small bunk beds in this room, each with a pair of wicker hampers stolen from the gnomes. The goblins keep their clothing and personal effects in these containers, so there is nothing of value or interest in them other than 1-4 daggers each.

Tactics: The guards fight until dead even if unarmored, as they know the penalty for failure. When noise alerts these goblins they will hasten to put on their armor, then leave the room on the double, and head directly for the guard post at Area 3, or else towards any noise or intruders who are visible to them. The serjeant of this squad hurls his caltrops down before advancing enemies, so that any characters moving into the area while attacking suffer 1d4 points of damage from stepping on them. A character suffering damage thus must spend the following round pulling the caltrop(s) out or risk additional damage.

1. **Natural **Cave This 35’ wide, 25’ long room is below the upper level. This grotto has a five-foot-wide entrance in the middle of its south wall, and a like exit across from it in the north wall. The

cave is smooth-floored with a low ceiling, the apex of its dome being only 10 feet above. This place is now the lair of the gnome wererats serving the goblin chief.

The number of wererats encountered here depends on the tone and the actions of the party. If it is day, there will be 4 here (or 6 if the two that were on guard duty managed to escape and get back). At night there will be six. These lycanthropes will be divided evenly along the two sides of the room, east and west. They fight to the death, as they know there is no chance for escape if confronted by a group of adventurers.

There are eight heaps of straw and old blankets and clothing in the room. These are the nests for the wererats. There are four to either side of the cave. Hidden somewhere in each nest there is the following treasure: 5-50sp, 1-4gp, 1-4 pieces of jewelry (10- 40gp value each), and a 50% chance for 1 healing potion or 2 flame breath potions. The wererats attempt to use these potions if in combat.

Rebel Faction Plot: If the “rebel faction” plot is being used, the wererats attempt to use this information to save their lives. They ask to be spared in return for assisting the team of adventurers, by informing them that the sub-chief and his followers will assist them in defeating the other goblins in the burrows.

**6.-8. Officers’ Quarters** Each of these rooms are occupied by a goblin officer and his concubine. Each is a 15’ x 15’ room with an 8’ ceiling. Loud noise in the corridor alerts the occupants to trouble, so all will be equipped and ready should anyone enter their room. After about 20 rounds (15+d6 rounds) they exit their rooms to discover the source of the commotion.

The small-scale furnishings in each include a bed, trunk, stand, small table, and two chairs. The trunks hold gnome and goblin clothing—nothing of interest to adventurers.

Tactics: The occupants herein will also fight fiercely until slain. If they exit the room, the male goblins will move to assist their fellows, and the females will cry out loudly for help, then follow them into combat.

will be equipped and ready for combat. After about 20 rounds, they exit their rooms to discover the source of the commotion in the hallways.

The small-scale furnishings in each include eight bunk beds, hampers, a large table, and two benches at the east end. The hampers hold gnome and goblin clothing, and goblin personal gear—nothing of interest to adventurers.

Tactics: These goblins fight fiercely until slain. If they exit their rooms, they move in the direction of any loud noise or commotion.

Areas 10, 11 and 12 These are occupied by the same number of goblins. These are described below.

Area 9 is larger than the others, so it has the above contingent and an additional six goblin warrior pickmen guarding it.

1. **Serjeant’s Quarters** This 20’ x 15’ room has an 8’ high ceiling. Four goblin serjeants are quartered here. Loud noise in the corridor alerts them to trouble. They will be equipped and ready to enter the fray after 20 rounds, exiting the room to discover the source of the commotion.

The small-scale furnishings herein include four beds, chests, a medium-sized table, and two benches in the middle of the place. The chests hold gnome and goblin clothing, and goblin personal gear—nothing of interest to adventurers.

Tactics: These goblin serjeants are just as willing to fight until slain as are the rest of the Green Skull Clan. If they exit the room the group will move in the direction of any loud noise or commotion. If there is no clear place to go, they will head for the check point at Area 17 to reinforce the guards there.

1. **Craftsmen’s Quarters** This 10’ x 60’ room has a 10’ high ceiling. This place will have the same number of occupants in the daytime as it does at night. Loud noise in the corridor will not alert the occupants to trouble, but a commotion in Area 15 does. In the latter case, all will be equipped and ready after 10 rounds. They will exit the room to see what is wrong in that area.

The small-scale furnishings herein include 10 triple bunk beds, hampers, a long and narrow table with two benches, and chairs at head and foot, in the middle of the place. The hampers hold gnome and goblin clothing, and goblin personal gear—nothing of interest to adventurers.

1. **Woodworking** This is a 20’ x 120’ room with a 12’ high ceiling. This is where the gnomes performed their woodworking, wicker weaving, blacksmithing, lapidary work on magnetite and pyrite stones, and herb preparation (drying and packaging). There are two fireplaces at 30 and 90 feet north, and a forge area at 60 to 70 feet north along the east wall. There is a barrel tumbler and a work bench for cutting stones near the south end of the space. In a corner near the tumbler is a pile of 200 semi-polished agates worth 1d10gp each (the goblins haven’t noticed them for anything but rocks). North of these are four work benches, with 24 high stools for workers to sit on while weaving or herb packaging. Next come four woodworking benches with small hand tools atop them, untouched by the goblins. There are drying racks for herbs near each fireplace. There is an anvil and tools near the forge, and two large tubs of water for quenching. The coals in the furnace are hot, and goblins are at work beating out and sharpening weapons. At the north end of this long space is a naturally circulating pool of water about eight feet in diameter, three-to-four feet deep, and naturally warm. It is screened off from the main chamber by free-standing wooden screens. The gnomes bathed here, but the goblins ignore the pool.

The goblins listed below are laboring at various work projects here; if they hear the sound of combat from Area 14 they go to investigate.

Tactics: These goblins are willing to fight fiercely until slain. If they exit the chamber the master workers will lead the group into Area 15 and attack any intruders they see.

1. **Barracks This is a 15’ x 20’ chamber with an 8’ high ceiling. The goblins here will just be arising to get ready for their duties, so they will not have armor if surprised. If they hear an alarm, or the sound of fighting, they will have their armor on in 10 rounds.

There are five small bunk beds in this room, each with a pair of wicker hampers stolen from the gnomes, and a small table and four chairs. A small cask of water stands near the entry. The goblins keep their clothing and personal effects in these containers, so there is nothing of value or interest in them.

Tactics: The guards will fight fearlessly if there is no safe escape from combat. If they hear an alarm call or the noise of combat


from Area 17, they will arm and move at double time to give battle. The serjeant will hurl his torch at invaders, and then wade into the fray.

1. **Guard **Post This 10’-wide passage is a guard post. The chief of the Green Skull Clan has posted guards here, three just north of the corner where the main east-west passage runs, and two regulars watching east along that corridor.

Tactics: The guards will fight fearlessly if there is no safe escape from combat. If they hear an alarm call or the noise of combat away from their area, they will call the alarm to their fellows in Area 16, but will not leave their post unless an officer or main leader commands them to do so. As with all the other goblin warriors here, they will not surrender.

1. **Audience Hall This is the forecourt, 55’ x 20’ in front, tapering to 25’ x 15’ in the rear, with a ceiling height of 12’. This place is paneled in polished walnut planks to 6’ height, the walls above that height plastered and painted, as is the ceiling. The walls have murals of sylvan woodland scenes on them, while the ceiling is painted sky blue with white clouds. There are six spherical globes of quartz in the room, two of clear crystal in sconces in the middle of the forecourt’s east and west walls, and another two in sconces at the corners where the forecourt tapers into the rear area. There are two pale yellow quartz crystals. One is hanging from the ceiling at eight feet height in the middle of the forecourt, and another is hanging at five feet inside the middle of the rear portion of the chamber. These globes emit magical light equal to a light spell when commanded to do so, but the goblins do not know that.

The forecourt is bare of furnishings, other than carpets spread on the floor and a large bronze cylinder. This is used as a warning bell, and when struck smartly by a large metal object, such as a sword, sounds loudly enough to alert Areas 19 and 20, and Area 22 if one or both of the double doors to area 18 are open! Centered in the rear portion of the hall is a throne-like chair of polished pear wood, padded with green velvet on arms and seat. Flanking it are two smaller chairs of cherry wood, padded with blue velvet. On the wall behind the central chair is a tapestry showing a green tree

with a golden sun above it, the emblem of the Green Friends Clan. The goblins have outlined a skull upon the foliage of the tree, and painted in the eye-sockets and open mouth in red, so as to have a grinning green skull centered on the wall hanging, the blazon of the goblins’ new Green Skull Clan.

Tactics: The regular goblins guarding the hall will immediately strike the warning bell, then attack intruders. They will fight in hopes of being reinforced, which is likely to happen, even if not in time to save their lives. The chief’s two female warrior guards and pet wolverine will come in from Area 19 on the 3rd round. The shaman and his apprentice will enter on the 11th round and begin casting spells. The chief and his other female warrior guards will enter the chamber on the 13th round, and close for combat on the 14th.

If there has been much commotion in this hall, the goblin chief and his guards (Area 19), as well as the shaman and his assistant (Area 20), will be here ready to battle. If there is time, once the chief and the others are in the hall the goblins will open the doors to the main corridor, report what they see, and the chief will react. See below.

If the leaders have been alerted, all their forces will be assembling in the main chamber 20 rounds after being warned. Two regular warriors will open the two doors to the hall, while their four fellows—flanked by a corporal on either side—will be ready to loose missiles. Behind the front line will be the serjeant, officers, two female warrior guards, with the shaman and apprentice shaman in the middle. The chief, one female warrior guard, and the wolverine will form a third rank.

The force will proceed to face in the direction of the foe, exit the hall, and move at best speed to join battle against the intruders. If the goblin chief is slain, all other goblins witnessing his demise will run away from combat at their fastest pace.

If no intruders are in sight, the front rank will split in two, half moving 10 feet east into the wide passage, the other half 10 feet west. The second rank will then likewise wheel left and right, the apprentice shaman facing to the east. As the guards from Area 17 are called for, the chief will move quickly across the hall to the doors to Area 22, calling out the alarm if there are goblins in the chamber. These goblins immediately come to their leader’s aid. (see Area 22). If none are there, the chief will panic, drink his speed potion, turn back and flee westwards—heading for the steps leading to the escape tunnel below (Area 2).

###### The Environs of Yggsburgh

1. **Chief’s Chamber The forepart of the room is 10’ x 15’, and widens in the rear to 15’ x 15’ with a 10’ high ceiling. The goblin chief took this place over, as it was where his gnome counterpart was housed. This place is wainscoted, plastered, and painted in the same manner as the throne room. A drapery separates the rear portion from the entry. There are two beds, a chest for clothing, and a chair in the forepart of the room. When the goblin chief is in his chamber, there are two female goblin warrior guards in attendance, one always awake, the other resting. A third is with the chief in his personal area.

The chief’s personal area has a bed, stand, table and chair, a chest for his clothing and an iron strongbox under the bed. The goblin lord has managed to open the gnome chief’s lock box without being pricked by the poison needle trap in its hasp’s latch. Anyone opening the latch with bare fingers will be pricked by the poisoned needle and suffer 2d8 poison damage per round, for five rounds. Saving throws are made at -5, so powerful is the poison. Remove trap attempts are also made at -5, and failure indicates the person attempting it has pricked their finger on the needle trap. Inside the iron box are 1,950sp, 50gp, 100 large chalcedony stones (translucent pale blue), 100 cornelian stones (opaque cherry red), and 100 sard stones (opaque chestnut brown). All are polished and cut, with an average weight of 50 carats and value of 25gp. The chest alone weighs 150 pounds. With the contents included, its weight is around 350 pounds.

Tactics: If the party comes into the chamber when the chief is here, the guard will immediately shout a warning and hurl her poisoned daggers, while the one resting enters combat on the 2nd round. At the warning cry, the chief and the third guard will arise from bed, arm themselves, and be ready in 10 rounds. Meantime, the chief’s pet wolverine will rush out to join the attack on the 3rd round.

1. **Shaman’s Chamber** The forepart of the chamber is 15’ and 20’ with a 10’ high ceiling, and the rear is 25’ x 10’ with a 10’ high ceiling. The shaman’s apprentice is stationed in the entry hall with the door to the main room ajar. The room proper has a pallet to the left of the entrance upon which the assistant shaman sleeps, a wicker hamper for his clothing and personal kit, and a small desk

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

and chair near it, with two free-standing screens separating his corner area from the shaman’s. The shaman has a bed, chest for clothing and personal items, padded armchair, small table, desk with shelves above it on which are items of food and drink, and a shrine on the west wall where he and his apprentice pay homage and pray to their deity.

The apprentice has a small spell book containing the following spells: 0-detect poison, arcane mark; 1st- magic missile. The book is located in a secret compartment under his chair. The shaman’s spell book is hidden in a wall niche behind the shrine, and it contains the following spells: 0-arcane mark, dancing lights, detect poison, message; 1st-burning hands, magic missile; 2nd- mirror image; 3rd-stinking cloud.

Rebel Faction Plot: If the rivalry is put into play, you should assume that the shaman’s apprentice is in league with the sub- chief. In such case he will do his best to seem active in fighting the intruders, but actually withholds his spells to determine if the rebel group is involved in the attack. Only if threatened with harm will he use his spells against the party without knowing if the sub-chief is allied with them. If he sees his fellow rebels fighting against the other goblins, he will then attack the shaman.

Tactics: If fighting the party, the apprentice will cast command, then magic missile against the most threatening enemy, and use hold person on another. He will cast cure light wounds upon himself when badly wounded, and attack with dagger if in extremis and unable to escape combat.

The Shaman will cast mirror image and then play his magical whistle until only one duplicate image remains. He then casts cause fear or slow against obviously strong foes, burning hands against direct attackers, and cure light wounds upon himself when badly wounded. He attacks with a dagger if in extremis and unable to escape combat.

1. **Sequestered **Chamber This room is 30’ x 15’ with an 8’ high ceiling. This place houses 36 ordinary, non-combatant goblins. What disposition the player characters make of these humanoids might pose a thorny moral and ethical problem for the party.


These goblins are females of ordinary sort, immature ones, and a few elderly. Will it be live and let live, or nits make lice?

Goblin non-combatants x36 _(HD _1d4, _HP _3, _AC _10, _PA _uoue, EQ _clothiug _aud _2d4cp.)_

1. **Dining Hall This room is 55’ x 20’ with a 10’ high ceiling. This place has two rows of three trestle tables. Each is flanked by benches, with smaller benches at head and foot, running east to west in the western two-thirds of the hall. Each table seats up to 12 small diners. At the eastern end are two tables in a T-shape, the upper stroke near the east wall. These tables have small chairs of gnome construction. This is where the leaders, their special guards, and the officers now dine. The head table accommodates eight, the lower one up to 12. At this time none of the diners are seated at the head tables, the officer sitting with two serjeants at a table separate from the corporals and regular goblins. The table service consists of plates, bowls, and cups made by the gnomes. The food being eaten is typical goblin fare—slumgullian stew. There are hunks of half-roasted boar on platters, from which the diners cut slices with their belt knives, boiled turnips, and nuts and hard cider that the gnomes stored up and piled on the tables.

The hall is illuminated by torches burning in wall sconces, this ambience enjoyed by both the gnomes who constructed the place and the goblins who wrested it from them. The diners are enjoying their repast, those finished gorging themselves idly talking or playing dice.

Whenever the party enters the burrows, there will be a certain number of goblins here. For the sake of drama (and if using the “rebel faction” plot), the Castle Keeper may wish to make this group the adherents of the clan’s sub-chief. That being the case, these diners will not assist the other goblins in their resistance to the intruders. They will indeed call out to the adventurers that they will assist them if the humans (and such demi-humans that are in the party) will swear to not harm them, and allow them and their families to go free when the chief and his followers are disposed of. If the rivalry and treachery of the goblin sub-chief and his faction is not employed, the Castle Keeper must assume that the humanoids eating in the hall are loyal subjects of the clan and will instantly attack any intruders.

Tactics: Assuming that the goblins above are treated as faithful to the chief, when they are attacked they will fight viciously to destroy the party. If they hear a commotion in the passage outside the dining hall they will open the doors and move out in formation to attack. They will form up in ranks of four, regulars first with spears to hurl, crossbow-armed regulars in two ranks behind them, the corporals in the fifth rank ready to move up to melee when the soldiers before them fall. Before the serjeants joins the formation, though, the officer will send one running to get the sub-chief unless the party enters from that place. The officer and the remaining serjeant will stay back, ready to move to where they are most needed to sustain the attack on the enemy.

The same tactics will generally be followed if the goblins here are rebels following the sub-chief and fighting against the others. Only two of the goblin servants are active, the other eight are seated at a corner table near the door to the kitchen corridor,

eating their meal. These goblins will flee attackers, heading for the nearest door that will allow them to escape.

1. **Sub-chief’s **Chamber This is a 15’ x 25’ room with a 9’ high ceiling. The doors into the room are bolted shut. The furnishings consist of the sub-chief’s bed, a chest for his clothing and personal belongings, a small table with an oil lamp, brandy bottle, and wooden cups atop it, and three chairs. There are two wicker hampers for his guards’ clothing and belongings, and a pallet near each of the two doors. Other than what they carry with them, these goblins have no wealth.

The sub-chief and his guards will be awake and fully armed whenever the characters arrive or the sub-chief is called. If the party attempts to enter this room from the south door, the sub- chief will demand to know who is seeking entrance. If possible, he will parley with intruders if the “rebel faction” option is being used. He is resentful that the chief has not given him more wealth. Otherwise the parley will simply be a stall, as one of his female warrior guards hastens out the north door to alert nearby goblins.

Tactics: The sub-chief and his guards will fight aggressively no matter the situation, whether he is a rebel or a stalwart follower of the chief. Only in the most hopeless of circumstances will this goblin use his potion of invisibility to attempt to escape with his life.

1. **Food **Storage This is a 15’ x 25’ room with a 10’ high ceiling.
###### The Environs of Yggsburgh

The outer door leading to its entrance is locked. The chief has the key. Much of the stores placed herein by the gnomes have been depleted, but there are still four big casks of hard cider, 12 kegs of pear brandy, and a partially empty tun of sweet grape wine. Barrels on the floor, baskets and sacks placed on wooden shelving along the walls holding such foodstuffs as nuts of various sort (beech, hickory, walnuts), sunflower and pumpkin seeds, dried mushrooms, and root vegetables are also found here. Also, on these shelves are 10 sealed pottery crocks of one-quart size, filled with preserved truffles. The gnomes discovered a small number of the fungus growing wild, cultivated them, and were approaching the time when they could add truffles to their list of major trade items. Each unopened crock is worth 10gp at wholesale price.

1. **Common Area This is a 20’ x 15’ chamber with a 10’ high ceiling. This place houses 24 ordinary, non-combatant goblins. If the “rebel faction” option is used, treat these individuals as belonging to the sub-chief’s following.

Goblin non-combatants x24 _(HD _1d4, _HP _3, _AC _10, _PA _uoue, EQ _clothiug _aud _2d4cp.)_

1. **Kitchen This is a 15’ x 30’ room, with a 15’ x 10’ pantry and scullery alcove. It has a 9’ high ceiling. The main feature of this chamber is the great fireplace where pots are boiled, meat roasted on a spit, and food baked in two side ovens. Charcoal is kept in a wooden box near the fireplace, and some split logs too. There are work tables for preparing the dishes, racks and shelves holding food ingredients, kitchen utensils, and various pots, pans, serving platters and the like.

At the end of the eastern alcove a niche is carved into the stone, where a running fountain of water flows into a basin and a drain for overflow. Next to this are several big tin tubs for washing dishes and cooking utensils—now unused. Open cupboards to either hand on the north and south wall were once filled with stores of things used in cooking and baking—yeast, sugar, flour of several kinds, salt, condiments, vinegar, honey, herbs, cooking oil, grain meals, etc. Almost all of those supplies have been used by the goblins and not replaced.

Working in here are the following individuals, who, if the “rebel faction” option is used, are followers of the sub-chief:

The Castle Keeper should take note of the characters’ accounts of this adventure after it is completed. As noted in the beginning of this scenario, if their defeat of the goblins is generally known, the team will gain renown, especially amongst demi-humans, gnomes in particular honoring them and giving them great respect for such bravery.

Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

#### Brothers of Giant Regard


**Location: Norvale

**Encounter Chart: Open Grasslands

**Zagyg Adventure Reference:** Buckswood Hills, Yggsburgh, Bigfish Lake, Deerwood, Menhir Hills, Garham, Lord Mayor of Yggsburgh

The Lord Mayor of Yggsburgh is even more covetous of Norvale than he is of the Lonely Valley. A road leading through it would enable enfeoffment of four or more knights with estates there. This would serve as the base for further expansion of town lands, and also bring Garham under Yggsburgh’s rule. However, the free foresters and wild elves that dwell in the woodlands of Norvale are determined to prevent the expansion of Yggsburgh’s dominions here, knowing that knights and settlers will devastate the natural ecology, destroying it and their way of life. Thus, they drive out surveyors and turn back wandering families seeking to settle in the valley.

###### Adventure Hooks

1. A party of four hunters from Garham meet the characters. They warn them that they have seen two forest giants lurking in the Lakepens Hills, hiding at the fringe of the Lake Woods, where they have managed to corral a dozen aurochs. The men from the hamlet are sure that these giants would rather dine on humans than wild cattle, so the adventurous strangers are warned to stay well away from where the hulking brutes have concealed themselves.

There are two olive-green-skinned giants ranging about the Lakepens Hills seeking something better to eat. Their names are Bolgrud and Rutlarg, and this “couple” enjoys feasting upon human, elf, dwarf and gnome.

Bolgrud, Forest Giant, male _(His eital stats are: HD 10d12,_ _HP _88, _AC _17, _ueutral _eeil. _His _prime _attributes _are: _physical._ _His great streugth (about 31) allows a +9 to hit aud damage.

Her club iuflicts 2d6 damage.)_

1. The Lord Mayor has heard of the exploits of the characters. He summons the characters to an audience and charges them to go to Norvale and encamp at its southern end, there to establish a base for an engineer, surveyor, and force of soldiers. They are supposed


to guard two men charting a route through the Buckswood Hills and the Deerwood, for a new artery leading east and north from the Menhir Hills Road into Norvale.

If the characters refuse this demand, they will be considered enemies by the Lord Mayor, and he will let that be known to all his officials and henchmen. If the party accepts the charge, they will be faced with hostile woodsmen and elves if they encamp in the valley. These woodsmen are led by a druid who demands that the characters not assist the town forces in their scheme, warning that warfare will result if they do.

Of course, this places the characters in a worse quandary than they faced in accepting or declining the mission in the first place. The likely tact to take to get out of this dilemma is for the characters to convince the free folk to demand the area be made their fief in return swearing fealty to the Lord Mayor, promising payments to Yggsburgh in natural produce from the area (pelts, hides, nuts, and timber) along with military service if Yggsburgh or its domains are threatened. Of course, an all-out war will bring the enemies of the town into the field, seeking to attack when there is a civil conflict raging! The Castle Keeper must decide how to manage all the nuances of this scenario.

There are two lists of forces below. The first contains those forces encountered in the first phase of the adventure. They include the human and elven woodsfolk the characters will be interacting with, as well as the troops and engineers from Yggsburgh. The list following contains those troops and leaders that will be called upon should war or confrontation result, and the Lord Mayor of Yggsburgh decides to invade the valley.

Should open warfare result from this adventure, the Castle Keeper will have to do some preparation to allow for the ensuing battles and encounters. This can be as narrow as the contingents fighting in and around Norvale, or possibly expand to engulf the entire region in war as Yggsbugh’s neighbors descend upon the town at a time of weakness.

**Location: Broadview Valley

**Encounter Chart: Open Grasslands

**Zagyg Adventure Reference:** Cold Springs Run, River Nemo, East Uplands, River High Road, Great Leech Marsh, Glittering Knobs, Norvale, Yggsburgh, Garham

**Villages of Note: Broadview Valley

There are only two thorps in the Broadview Valley, and they are located in an exposed position along the River Nemo. The thorps sit upon the River High Road, which offers easy travel through this area. This fertile and partially unsettled and unclaimed


valley poses a thorny (and not a little tempting) problem for the Yggsburgh’s rulers.

Only the western half of the Broadview Valley acknowledges the authority of Yggsburgh. Should settlers from Yggsburgh be encouraged to move into the place by granting them land freeholds? Should the free town assist in building a community as far east as possible? The latter would allow the knighting of two or three eligible wealthy gentlemen who, with manors populated by prisoners released from confinement and made villains, could build castles and help defend the valley and the town.

However, such a move would surely arouse the ire of the free miners of the Glittering Knobs, all the independent folk in, and for miles around, the Broadview Valley including Garham and its allies. As with the Lonely Valley and Norvale, eastward encroachment on the free borderlands brings angry reaction from all. Civil strife invites invasion, something being easily accomplished in this area…

###### Adventure Hooks

1. The local folk here are concerned about a large band of gypsies who have camped in the east central area of the valley. The gypsies are blamed for the capturing of wild horses, and the killing of all the other animals they can hunt down, as well as stealing livestock. Now several young children are missing from their homes. Will the heroic adventurers undertake to recover the missing children, return the rustled livestock, and make the interlopers move on? The Castle Keeper should decide how much truth there is to the claims of the locals and encourage the players to investigate—if they feel so inclined.

###### The Gypsy Band

The gypsy band consists of about 90 people in all. They travel in 10 wagons pulled by two-horse teams and 6 carts pulled by a single horse. Additionally there is a large herd of 30 draft horses, 24 riding horses (20 of which are light war horses), and 20 still- wild horses in process of being broken to yolk or saddle. They are encamped in the Broadview Valley.

The band is lead by “Prince” Verlink Noleskoy and his wife, “Princess” Jarmishu. Mykkul Hooshadak acts as the bands spiritual advisor, “Captain” Leshy Iabdunia leads the band’s “cavalry,” and “Lady” Yallinia is the gypsy’s eye into the future.

The gypsy wagon train is filled with supplies for the entire band, such as foodstuffs, clothing, camping equipment and other items of necessity. Of special note is a crystal ball in Lady Yallinia’s wagon, and in the wagon belonging to Verlink Noleskoy a large strongbox with much treasure in it. This strongbox is protected by a trap. The trap can be disarmed, but at a -9 to the check. It is a poison needle trap that delivers 2d6 damage immediately (½ damage with a successful poison save). The box contains 4 healing elixirs restoring 4-16 HP each, 10 pieces of jewelry with a worth of 100-600gp each, 100 gems valued at 5gp each, and 200 gold coins.

Additionally, each of the wagons contain the following items: 0-1 pieces of jewelry worth 5-20gp each

1-6 gemstones worth 2-20gp each

10-100gp worth of various coin

1. The Lord Mayor of Yggsburgh summons the party to a private audience. He is planning to enfeoff a landless knight and set his estates in the east of the Broadview Valley. The castle seat is to be located at the junction of the South Eel River and the River Nemo. The Lord Mayor offers this to the characters.

If the heroic strangers are interested in settling down, the Lord Mayor grants knighthood to their leader and makes the others gentlemen (or esquires if already of that status). They are granted a maximum of 10 manors to oversee, and 1-2 manors for each of the others, with a maximum of 16 manors offered. All the characters need do is build a castle, subdue the local population and make them their vassals. Yggsburgh supplies villains to work, and others from the community will undoubtedly be glad to rent land, once things are settled.

If the party wishes to remain uncommitted, they are asked to serve as mercenary guards at a fee of 100-500gp per month per person, and appointment as knight or esquire, and each given 1-2 of 10 manors to oversee and be beholden to Sir Eberhardt Beemish.

Of course, either choice will put them into conflict with the local free folk, and the characters will be hated and reviled and attacked whenever possible by all the humans and demi-humans resisting the expansion of the town.

If Sir Eberhardt Beemish is appointed, the characters will be under his command. He is a very rich and overbearing fellow, the heir to a considerable fortune made in river trade (including smuggling, slave dealing, and piracy). Sir Beemish brings his esquire Terrance Plumly, his chaplain the Pious Lamont Snives, his seneschal, Erlodor Birdlime, and some unsavory mercenaries while settling and subduing these lands. Senechal Erlodor Birdlime, a very wicked fellow indeed, is the real power behind Sir Beemish. Of course all concerned will be rapacious, cruel, and dastardly

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

in all their acts and dealings. Proving the nature of the newly created knight will suffice to forgive any attack upon him and his followers, as all of the Beemish family possessions will become property of the town.

The stats for Sir Eberhardt Beemish, the esquire Terrance Plumly, the Pious Lamont Snives and Erlodor Birdlime are located in the Asppendix I, Orders of Battle.

#### Mushrooms at the Brown Jug


**Location: Wild Mead

**Encounter Chart: Open Grasslands

**Zagyg Adventure Reference:** Serpent Ridge, Glittering Knobs, Dire Forest, East Uplands, Yggsburgh

**Villages **of **Note: Coverdale

Much of the Wild Meads are an uninhabited and wild place. All manner of large and small animals roam these parts. It is not altogether wild, though. Along the eastern verge of the Wild Meads is the small hamlet of Coverdale. Inhabited by 300 or so halflings, the inhabitants of Coverdale are mostly farmers, though the town also has a smithy, general store and a tavern, the Brown Jug. Wild elves from the Dire Forest occasionally make their way here, chasing game as is their want. The entire area seems peaceful. However, looks are often deceiving and travel to and from Coverdale is occasionally dangerous indeed.

The hamlet of Coverdale is detailed in Part III, Communities of Yggsburgh, Coverdale.

###### Adventure Hooks

1. On a late afternoon while the characters are in Coverdale, a pair of halflings who had been out gathering wild mushrooms come into the Brown Jug Tavern panting. They have seen a large warband of goblins heading for the community! What can be done to save the folk from these cruel humanoid raiders?

The characters must get busy and ask questions. From what direction are the goblins coming? (“They are coming from the southeast.”) How many are there in the attacking party? (“There were more than two score of those horrible goblins!”) Do they have any trained attack animals (wargs) with them? (“We saw two serving as steeds for the leaders of the party.”) How far distant are they? (“When we spotted them we were about two miles inside the Dire Forest. Luckily for us they were camping, roasting a great wild boar on a spit, so they didn’t notice us, nor did their wargs


smell us.”) What makes you think they are headed this way? (“We heard them shouting and laughing that their next meal would spitted roast halfling!”)

So the adventurers need to plan an immediate attack on the encamped goblins, or else devise one for ambushing them when they come to attack the hamlet sometime late at night.

1. In passing through this area, the party comes upon a female halfling by the name of Althea Clover. The druidess is from Coverdale and was out harvesting herbs when attacked by a pair of goblins. She barely managed to survive the combat and is now attempting to return home. Her wounds are severe and

###### The Environs of Yggsburgh

debilitating, such that she is having extreme difficulty making headway, and to make matters worse, she is now being followed by a large bear.

Within 1d6 rounds of the characters finding Althea, the brown bear attacks. The bear, a man-eater, roars and comes rushing from some nearby bushes, intent on devouring the halfling and anyone else that attempts to prevent it from enjoying a tasty meal.

Assuming the characters deal with the animal and Althea Clover survives, the halfling pleads with the party to help her get back home. She guides them to Coverdale if they agree to help her. Although the halfling folk there will not be hostile, they are not pleased to have humans in their community.

**Towns **of **Note: Villages of the South Pastures

Sir Anthony Belvoir and Sir Wade Fulgent both have manor houses in the South Pastures. It is a settled and productive region belonging to Yggsburgh. There are four villages and numerous thorps spread throughout the area, focusing mainly upon agricultural produce. But this fertile river valley is not without its problems. Its produce attracts raiders and bandits, while Yggsburgh’s neighbors are always on the lookout for potential allies amongst Yggsburgh’s nobility and ruling elite.

The manors, villages and thorps are detailedin Part III, Communities of Yggsburgh, Viallages of the South Pastures.

###### Adventure Hooks

If the barbarian raiders heading for the Westfields (see Environs Encounter 29, The Drumbeat of War) manage to sack that area, they next head for the South Pastures. Assume that the barbarians have been reinforced with about 200 warriors, and that 200 remain behind in a fortified base camp in the Westfields. Those raiders moving to the South Pastures survived the initial attacks

on the Westfields, and are now horsed and coming here to loot and pillage. They are attacking and plundering the surrounding countryside virtually unchecked, and are tying up Yggsburgh’s forces.

The party will need to alert the two knights of South Pastures, and convince them to call up all available troops, freemen included, to face the horde of barbarians. If the adventurers succeed in this, they will need to have a good plan so as to ensure the raiders are beaten and driven back west, if not virtually eliminated. Possible tactics include ambush, the use of war engines, and recruiting miners from the Glittering Knobs (as their diggings will be a target for barbarian attacks once the South Pastures are cleared). The likelihood of getting demi-human assistance requires that both the dwarf and gnome leaders agree, for one group will not leave their mines unguarded from the other.

In preparing for this adventure, should it be chosen, use of the Orders of Battle is necessary to develop the demi-human contingent, if any. The Villages of the South Pastures details those troops available to the two lords ruling the South Pastures. A suggested horde of barbarians is supplied below. Chiefs and aides are also supplied, but use of those mentioned for the Westfields is also possible. The barbarians will, as in the Westfields, be split into two groups, each with a chief and aide.

An informant from Yggsburgh advises the party that one of the two knights in the South Pastures is a traitor. This knight is in communication with one of the three nobles neighboring Yggsburgh, all of whom are seeking to conquer the free town. The characters will need to pay a call upon each of the two and discover which is planning to assist whom when, or if, an attack comes. They must then take the proof to the Lord Mayor of Yggsburgh and present it convincingly so that the turncoat can be arrested. The turncoat will then be replaced by a cousin and the characters handsomely rewarded.

The Castle Keeper should decide which neighboring power or powers is threatening to attack, which knight is the traitor and what the political and military ramifications of the entire situation may be, however acted out. Extensive use of the Orders of Battle, and reference to Yggsburgh and its culture, should suffice to give the Castle Keeper enough information to plan out this entire adventure.

#### The Unholy Ringstones


Location: Hiddendale Encounter Chart: Wooded Hills Map Reference: 35

Zagyg Adventure Reference: Menhir Hills, Sir Alec of Gaxhill, The Lord Mayor, Yggsburgh College, Yggsburgh Library, Great Druid Dycott Grover

Towns of Note: Villages of the South Pastures

In the small remote valley of Hiddendale is the site of an ancient holy place. Long deserted by human folk, elves thought to make it theirs, but in only a few years abandoned the area as unwholesome. Thereafter, gnomes began burrowing into the steep and rocky hills embracing Hiddendale, but they too gave off their colonization efforts when their numbers began to mysteriously dwindle. The last inhabitants of the valley were a small clan of dwarves who discovered traces of gold in the hills where the gnomes had dug their burrows. These demi-humans knew the evil reputation of Hiddendale, but their avarice for precious metal clouded their judgment. They mined and began to bring forth large nuggets of pure gold. Soon something happened to disrupt the harmony of the clan, and they began quarreling and fighting amongst themselves. At the same time their numbers were shrinking from unexplained disappearances. A handful of survivors returned to Yggsburgh some three decades past, swearing the place was cursed, vowing never to go back despite the yellow ore there. Certainly there are strange things that slink through the valley at night…

Locating Hiddendale is difficult and can take some time. If traveling there without the aid of some person who knows its location, a ranger must make a successful tracking check three days in a row to locate it. This tracking check is made at -10, so difficult is the valley to locate. Once located, the characters will eventually stumble across the strange twisted oaks at the north end of the vale and thence unto the Unholy Ringstones themselves.

###### The Unholy Ringstones

Other than the process of discovering Hiddendale and finding out about the Unholy Ringstones, this is very much a hack and slash adventure, with exploration and problem solving as the main elements of play after combat. Having either a very strong and magically-armed party, or with a druid of about 7th level, is necessary for initial success here, so encourage your players to seek more information about the area if they are bent on setting forth without the capacity to survive this challenge. While gathering the information, all manner of adventures can be had, and the appropriate power and levels attained for success. Many new monsters are introduced in this adventure, so be sure to peruse the Monsters of Zagyg appendix before proceeding, paying special attention to the Penumbrate Shadow.

Information regarding the Unholy Ringstones can be gained by the adventurers in many ways. The following is a list of the more common manners in which information is gleaned.

###### The Environs of Yggsburgh

The Lord Mayor: When meeting and conversing with the Lord Mayor and mentioning Hiddendale or the Unholy Ringstones, he frowns. If conversation is followed up upon, the Lord Mayor says that the locale is a shame to the druidical faith and warns the characters to stay away from the place. He will say, “Were I not burdened with the charge of seeing to the welfare of this town and its people, I would gather a strong party and stamp out that abomination!” Nothing more will he say in regard to this matter.

Sir Alec of Gaxhill: When conversing with Sir Alec of Gaxhill on the subject of Hiddendale, the Unholy Ringstones, or Druidical faith in the area, the knight relates that he has heard many ill things about the place, that a great druid once dwelled there, turned to evil, and so there came to be nothing but death around this “grand place of Druidical worship.” He will advise the characters to stay away from the locale. “Hard as it is to find, worse still for those who manage to locate it!”

Yggsburgh College library: If researching in the Yggsburgh College library regarding non-human occupants of the area, Hiddendale, Unholy Ringstones, or Druidical places of worship, the following entry will be discovered (a near-direct quote from the Castle Keeper’s information given for Hiddendale):

“There is a small, remote valley in the Menhir Hills, some 35 miles overland north and a little east of the Free City of Yggsburgh, that is named Hiddendale. It is an oval of three miles length by two miles width. For some arcane reason it is very difficult to locate this place, and even a ranger can miss it. This small valley is the site of an ancient Druidical holy place. Long deserted by human folk, elves thought to make it theirs, but in only a few years abandoned the area as unwholesome. Thereafter, gnomes began burrowing into the steep and rocky hills embracing Hiddendale, but they too gave off their colonization efforts when their numbers began to dwindle mysteriously. The last inhabitants of the valley were a minor clan of nomadic dwarves that discovered traces of gold in the hills where the gnomes had dug their burrows. These demi-humans knew the evil reputation of Hiddendale, but their avarice for precious metal clouded their judgment. They mined and began to bring forth large nuggets of pure gold. Soon something happened to disrupt the harmony of the clan, and they began quarreling and fighting amongst themselves. At the same time, their numbers were shrinking from unexplained disappearances. A handful of survivors came into the town some three decades in the past, swearing the place was cursed, vowing never to go back despite the yellow ore there.”

**Town **Library: This is the entry that will be discovered in research in the town library in a text dealing with Druidical places of worship:

_There was formerly in this locale, in the small valley called Hiddendale, a monumental stone construction _that _was _held _as _most _holy _to _those of the Druidical faith. Approximately 100 years ago, _just _before _this _glorious _Town _was _founded, a procession of druids passed through declaring the place as anathema because of the heresy of the great druid who was responsible for the site._

###### Background

The Archdruid named Dycott Grover was born to a family of the faithful, his father and mother both being of the calling. He was a precocious child, only 12 when he entered into the First Circle. Thereafter, he advanced rapidly, spending scarcely more than a year in attaining initiation into each of the higher circles of the Druidical faith. When he was an ordained Druid at age 27, he was the youngest to have ever achieved so high a rank.

This made Dycott Grover proud, somewhat overly so, and that pride made him haughty. The Hierophants detected these flaws and acted to eliminate them by slowing his advancement thereafter. He was sent to work amongst the Elven folk in remote areas and was past the age of 40 before his elevation to the rank of Archdruid. Although bitter about the delay, the new Archdruid Dycott threw himself into his new duties with singular dedication, greatly excelled in his tasks and was clearly more effective than all like persons of the rank. It was at this time that his Elven wife, a Druidess of the Seventh Circle herself, left him. Divorce was granted to her because of his neglect. There can be no doubt that this affected Dycott Grover more than the Hierophant’s purposeful suppression of his advancement. Bitterness turned to inner rage and a monomaniacal determination to rise to the highest rank of the faith.

Despite some who cautioned against his further advancement, Dycott was made Archdruid of the lands that include the Town of Yggsburgh when he was age 45 because of his absolute dedication and vast ability. To prove his detractors wrong, the new Archdruid determined to build a great place of worship using massive stone monoliths, as was done in ancient times. Then, he reasoned,


thousands would flock to the monument for worship, making him first a Great then the Grand Druid and perforce a Hierophant because of his following. Then there would be none who could prevent his rise to the first of the Cabal. No longer would he, Dycott Grover, be held down by jealous rivals!

Of course, the construction of the sacred circle of stones was a slow process. It took a full year for the first menhir to be quarried, shaped, brought to the dell he had chosen as the site for the monumental complex, and set upright. At that rate, Dycott calculated he would be too old to enjoy his triumph. Many questions bothered him. Why hadn’t he a lifespan comparable to that of an elf? Why was there no natural spell that would speed construction? Extend his years? In his growing frustration, the Archdruid began seeking means for fulfilling his desires in writings not of Druidical nature. In his quest, he turned to forbidden works of blackest sort. It was within a grimoire of this kind that he discovered a summoning ritual promising an entity that would be of service in building vast edifices. The most ancient entity called upon in these summonings would be one that could command the greatest of elementals.

Dycott Grover, in his hubris, thought he could deal with such evil without risk, and so after much preparation he performed the dreadful ritual that summoned this malign deity. To his surprise, the being that appeared to him was no terrible monstrosity from the Nether Planes. The summoned entity was a fatherly figure of power and vitality. Rather than threatening or demanding, the entity was pleased at being called forth by so wise a person as an Archdruid, expressed keen interest in the reason for being summoned, listened attentively and gave words of counsel in return. Cautioning against haste, the being, who identified himself as Aldforent, noted that Dycott Grover might lose his powers if he proceeded rashly. Then, before he disappeared, he instructed the Archdruid to consult with him weekly by further performance of the summoning ritual.

Of course, each further summoning placed Dycott more firmly under the malign deity’s influence. It was not long before the Archdruid swore eternal fealty to him, and thereupon the so- called Aldforent caused earth elementals to appear and build the whole of the monumental structure of menhirs, and a secret underground complex too, in a single night. There was amazement amongst the faithful flock when they beheld the miracle. Dycott Grover was thrown into a rage, however, when most of those seeing the place fled in terror. Then it came to him that he was no longer a true and faithful Druid. While he still possessed a semblance of his former powers, he had changed, and this change was apparent to most of those of his former faith.

Summoning Aldforent, the once-Archdruid furiously demanded to be returned to his former state. The evil entity laughed, for not even he could undo what Dycott Grover had willingly done. Still in paternal guise, the malign deity played upon all of the human’s weaknesses—lust for power, desire for unending life, unquestioning obedience from others and the desire to punish those who offended him. Beguiled in his despair, the former Archdruid took the last step in his damnation. Her performed the ghastly Ritual of Penumbrate Shadow, and became what he

remains now: a horrible travesty of his former self, a vile lurker in shadows that consigns others to the unspeakable state he is in.

As the penumbrate shadow that was once Archdruid Dycott Grover gloats over his unholy domain, he also rages that there are not more of his kind to serve him. The ancient evil elemental deity could not stop the forces of nature from confining his new protégé to the ringstones while in shadow form. For Dycott Grover can move no more than 14 miles from the ring of stones. That being the case, the wicked entity was not quite satisfied with the soul of his dupe. For the deity, whose realm is in that place between Chaos and Order, is as bitter and limited in his freedom as is the former Archdruid, whom he had hoped would be able to move about more freely.

Although the penumbrate shadow Dycott Grover is aware of the desires and disappointments of Aldforent, he has taken all possible measures to protect his physical remains, continue his existence in the Plane of Shadow and periodically roam the material world, albeit in most limited range. He has used other forbidden books to encourage ghouls to come to the area during the hours of night, and prey upon any persons living near the ringstones. Involuntary penumbrate shadows have been placed to guard the menhirs, to slay those who touch them and keep intruders from the inner part of the circle. The altars are protected with deadly devices, and have the keys and magical aids that the Lords of Nature have placed there to keep to keep the cursed heretic in place, so he can be discovered in his underground lair and then destroyed.

The main objectives for the party are several. First, they must find a means of defeating the guardians of the menhirs so as to be able to enter the circle. They must then discover how to get to the keys and magic items contained in each of the four altars, so as to be able to enter the central cairn. Thirdly, they need to open the four false tombs, defeat their occupants, and gain more magical devices. Next they need to discover the

doubly secret means of entering the crypt of the former Archdruid, and finally they must confront and best him in penumbrate shadow form, so as to be able to destroy his physical remains.

###### The Dell of the Ringstones

The exact location of this place is left in the hands of the Castle Keeper, but the Unholy Ringstones (a circle of menhirs) is generally located in a valley dell about a bowshot distance north of Hiddendale. The preceding text regarding the difficulty of locating the area, and what lies within it, applies and stems from that which created the monumental stone complex known as the Unholy Ringstones.

The area surrounding the Unholy Ringstones is heavily wooded with massive but strangely twisted oak trees. In the hollow surrounding the ringstones, only sickly weeds spot the barren, ash-gray dirt. The terrain is hilly, with

###### The Environs of Yggsburgh

many small ridges and swales that cut line of sight considerably. As the party moves through here, they notice the nature of the trees. A druid or even a ranger notes that there is something definitely wrong with the way the vegetation grows. After they pass through the deformed oaks, the clearing of the dell is discovered in but a few minutes’ time.

###### Random Encounters

Check for a random encounter once an hour while the characters are within 14 miles of the ringstones. Roll a d6. A ‘1’ indicates an encounter. Then roll a d6 and refer to one of the two tables below to determine the type of encounter. There are both daytime and nighttime encounter tables. There can be no more than 6 encounters in a day.

###### Day



3	Hobgoblins (d20+10)

4	Gnoles (d20+5)



###### Night



6	Ghouls (d6) and Ghasts (1-3)

Outside the circle of ringstones there is a gloom, and what seems to be a thick fog, hanging above the depression in which they sit, making even a bright and sunny day a dim and dismal vista in the dell.

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

Characters of good alignment will be most uneasy when viewing the ring of menhirs, and not at all comfortable if approaching the standing stones. Chaotic and lawful neutral characters will be somewhat apprehensive. Those of chaotic or lawful evil alignment will feel uncomfortable, and true neutral characters will feel slightly uneasy. Only neutral evil characters will feel no tension when seeing the monumental construction.

##### The Circle of Menhirs

Each menhir is a slab of rock 10 feet wide, two feet thick, and 16 feet tall. Another four feet of the menhirs are buried in the ground. Each of these monoliths is covered with a lichen of unwholesome appearance, giving the gray stone a red-brown tinge reminiscent of dried blood. Inside the circle of standing stones can be seen four rocks of smaller size and no great height. They are placed in the cardinal directions. The one to the west looks like an altar and is directly in front of the opening that leads into the central cairn.

It is not possible for any character to pass through the 15-foot spaces between the menhirs until all of the standing stones have been touched and their guardian penumbrate shadow(s) destroyed. Whenever anyone attempts to go between, under, or around the menhirs, they will be repelled. No magical means will allow passage, so strong are the magical spells that are upon this place. Any attempt to pass through incurs damage according to the alignment of the individual.

###### Alignment	Damage


**1st **Menhir This stone shows the following runes: a ‘4’ above a ‘T’ above a ‘T’ above an ‘A.’ When touched the runes glow red and then fade after two rounds.

As the menhir is touched, two shadowy gray figures emerge from the standing stone. One looks human, a man in antique armor with a sword. The other is like a life-sized ink drawing of a vicious ogre with a knobby bludgeon. The ogre is one of the original guardians of the place, but has been made a penumbrate shadow.

As the menhir is touched a shadowy gray figure emerges from the standing stone. She looks like an outlaw that has become a gray shadow, and she holds a dagger.

Penumbrate shadow, medium involuntary _(Its _eital _stats _are:_

It is possible for a character to touch the standing stones without incurring any damage. When this occurs, refer to the appropriate menhir to discover what the results are. Additionally, each menhir has glowing letters upon it. They contain a message and clue important to the characters.

When aligned and read properly, the letters spell out a sentence. The chart below indicates which Menhirs have which letter codes and how the whole can be read.

Penumbrate shadows guard all the menhirs. If a character withdraws more that 15 feet from the front of a menhir it is guarding, it does not attack and simply merges back into the stone or earth, reappearing the instant any intruder comes within its range. When all of the guardians have been eliminated, the party can pass into the inner area the standing stones encircle.

**4th **Menhir This stone shows the following runes: a ‘Y’ above an ‘E’ above a ‘W’ above an ‘E.’ When touched the runes glow red and then fade after two rounds.

As the menhir is touched a shadowy gray figure springs up from the earth. He looks like a woodcutter sketched in charcoal, but somehow the great axe he holds seems to glitter metallically.

**5th **Menhir This stone shows the following runes: an ‘S’ above an ‘A’ above an ‘A’ above an ‘R.’ When touched the runes glow red and then fade after two rounds.

As the menhir is touched two figures spring up before it. Both are colorless, shadowy gray figures. They appear human in form, one a man in brigand’s jack with a sword, and a young woman in a robe with a sickle in her hand. This is a druidess and her aide who, having been made by the original guardian, could not manage to stave off the attack of Grover. Both are now doomed to the spot.

As the menhir is touched a comely lass comes stepping forth from the standing stone. She appears to be a chiaroscuro version of a young peasant girl. She smiles and holds out her hand, as if she expects to be rescued. (But she does not actually expect that, she hopes to lure the character near, touch him, then strike with the dagger concealed in her left hand immediately thereafter in the round, thus draining twice the usual Strength from the dupe.)

1. **North Altar Stone This is an X-shaped altar constructed of brownstone and about 3 feet in height. It is 11’ long per stroke, each arm having a thickness of 2 feet. This altar has a magical and evil aura. The stone begins to glow with an inner red light when any living creature comes within three feet of it.

The altar stone is protected by an elemental power of flame and fire. Touching it delivers 1d4 of fire damage. All saves for avoidance are made at -10, and items which reduce damage from fire are only half effective. Once so activated, the inner portion of the altar shows three wavy lines that anyone scrutinizing the area from up to 10-foot distance will notice as representing water. To neutralize the effect of the element of fire contained herein, four ounces of holy water, or no less than a gallon of magically purified water, must be dashed upon the lines symbolizing water.

Once the elemental power guarding the altar is neutralized, the stone is no longer dangerous. An examination of its top will show the flame mark seen on the east altar. If fire of the sort needed to neutralize the east altar is employed atop this one, a section of the top is vaporized, revealing several items of interest to the characters.

A copper torch: This is the key to opening the north tomb, and upon command this item will shed light equal to as little as a candle or as bright as a large bonfire (a 40 ft. radius), and twice a day it will likewise send forth a gout of flame to 40’ distance, inflicting 4d8 damage on the target subject.

A copper ring: This ring offers +2 protection from fire and heat.

A mace: This +3 fire mace is set with a ruby in its haft and emits flames when it strikes (the source of the +3 to damage). When used against air elementals it acts as a +6 mace. If the gem is damaged or removed the weapon loses its enchantment.

1. **East Altar Stone This is a hollow tube of blue marble that is 9’ in diameter, with a thickness of 1’, an inner diameter of 7’, and a height of 3’. This altar has a magical aura, as well as one of evil. The stone begins to glow with an inner green light, making it blue- green, when any living creature comes within three feet of it.

The altar stone is protected by an elemental power of water and ice. Touching it delivers 1d4 of cold damage. All saves for avoidance are made at -10, and items which reduce damage from cold are only half effective. Once so activated, the inner portion of the altar shows a wavy outline that anyone scrutinizing the area from up to 10-foot distance will notice as representing flame. To neutralize the effect of the element of water contained herein, no less than a pint of flaming lamp oil or a magically engendered flame must be dashed upon the wavy line symbolizing fire.

Once the elemental power guarding the altar is neutralized, the stone is no longer dangerous. An examination of its top shows the water markings seen on the north altar. If water of the sort needed to neutralize the north altar is employed atop this one, a section of the top is vaporized, revealing several items of interest to the characters.

An iron hook: This is the key to opening the east tomb. When held, it enables normal breathing and free action in any sort of water. When in water, with the proper command it can send forth an icy spear to a distance of 80 feet, that inflicts 4d4 damage upon the target. This property can be used twice a day.

An iron ring: This ring proffers +2 protection from cold, ice and water effects.

Axe: This +2 axe is set with a sapphire in its haft, and delivers a blast of ice when it hits (the source of the damage bonus). It is +4 when used against fire elementals. If the gem is damaged or removed the weapon loses its enchantment.

1. **South Altar Stone This is a flat-topped triangle of alabaster that is 8’ per side, 3’ high. This altar has a magical aura as well as one of evil. The stone begins to darken in its center with stormy black when any living creature comes within three feet of it.

The altar stone is protected by an elemental power of air and wind. Touching it delivers 1d4 of electrical damage. All saves for avoidance are made at -10, and items which reduce damage from electricity are only half effective. Once so activated, the inner portion of the altar shows three pyramids that anyone scrutinizing the area from up to 10-foot distance will notice as representing earth. To neutralize the effect of the element of air contained herein, a lead object or no less than a pound of earth or magically created stone must be dashed upon the lines symbolizing earth.

Once the elemental power guarding the altar is neutralized, the stone is no longer dangerous. An examination of its top shows the earth markings seen on the west altar. If lead, earth, or stone of the sort needed to neutralize the west altar are employed atop this one, a section of the top is vaporized, revealing several items of interest to the characters.

###### The Environs of Yggsburgh

A silver baton: This is the key to opening the south tomb. When held, pointed and commanded, this baton allows flight as if the possessor were an eagle, or it can be used to cast control winds four times a day or whirlwind twice a day (a whirlwind effect expends two of the control wind effects). These are cast as if by a 12th level druid.

Silver ring: This ring confers a +2 protection from electricity and wind effects.

Spear: This +3 spear is set with a diamond in the butt of its shaft, and delivers an electrical shock when it hits (the source of the +3 damage). This bonus is +6 when used against earth elementals. If the gem is damaged or removed, the weapon loses its enchantment.

1. **West Altar Stone This is a rectangle of serpentine that is 10’ long, 4’ wide, and 3’ high. This altar has a magical aura as well as one of evil. The stone begins to show inner veins of gray-brown that resemble the tentacles of an octopus when any living creature comes within three feet of it.

The altar stone is protected by an elemental power of earth and stone. Touching it causes a tentacle to lash out, delivering 2d4 points of traumatic physical damage. All saves for avoidance at are made at -10, and items which reduce damage from earth or stone magic are only half effective. Once so activated, the inner portion of the altar shows a nebulous billowy outline like a cloud that anyone scrutinizing the area from up to 10-foot distance will notice as representing air. To neutralize the effect of the element of earth contained herein, a draft of air must be fanned upon for a full minute, or magically engendered air must be directed upon, the lines symbolizing water.

Once the elemental power guarding the altar is neutralized, the stone is no longer dangerous. An examination of its top shows the nebulous cloud lines seen on the south altar. If air or wind of the sort needed to neutralize the south altar is employed atop this one, a section of the top is vaporized, revealing several items of interest to the characters.

**Gold **buckle: This is the key to opening the west tomb. When worn with a belt, this item gives a +2 magical strength to the wearer and also adds +6 to movement. It can be used as often as three times a day to meld the wearer into earth, stone, or wood, where they remain without harm, able to see and hear normally for as long as eight hours in each substance.

**Gold ring:** This ring offers +3 protection from the impact of earth (falling included) or stone (but not metal weapons) upon the wearer.

**Broadsword:** This +2 broadsword is set with an emerald in its pommel, and delivers a jolt of physical damage to anyone hit by it (the source of the +2 to damage). It acts as a +4 broadsword when used against air elementals. If the gem is damaged or removed the weapon loses its enchantment.

Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

##### The Cairn

The cairn is made of great slabs of rock like the menhirs. There are 11 of them fitted together so as to form an octagon of 30-foot diameter, with an entrance hallway of 10-foot width and 20-foot length leading in. The whole of it is roofed over with stone slabs, so no light penetrates the interior. It is as if a black curtain were drawn across the entrance.

The burial complex is hewn from stone and the rooms sheathed in marble. All the passages have smooth and polished floors and walls, and arched ceilings that rise 12 feet above the floor. All the doors in the underground portion of the complex are solid igneous rock, of the color indicated in the area description. All open only by the touch of the proper key. If the wrong key is touched to a door, the key vanishes and is transported back to where it came from, inflicting in the process 4d8 points of shock damage to all within 20 feet of the door it was used on. A successful constitution check reduces this damage by half.


1. **Central Cairn: The hallway leading into the central cairn is magically protected. In order for non-penumbrate shadow creatures to enter the central cairn, the four altars must have been visited, their secrets revealed, and the “key” from each must be in possession of the party wishing to pass through.

The entrance hallway is 10’ in width and 20’ in length. The central cairn area is a hexagonal chamber walled by 11 standing stones that are each 10’ wide, 2’ thick, and 16’ high, with 4 more feet of each stone buried in the ground. The whole of the structure is roofed over with stone slabs, so no light penetrates the interior. It is as if a black curtain were drawn across the entrance. Within the main chamber of the cairn there is a square pillar of seemingly solid granite, 10’ per side, that reaches to and supports the rock slabs forming the ceiling 16’ above the stone floor. Each face of the square pillar is engraved with one of the elemental signs from the altars— flame to the north, water to the east, cloud to the south, mountains to the west.

After each of the magic weapons from the altars is touched to the proper marking on the column (shown below), a portion of the south side of the room sinks into the floor to reveal a spiral staircase leading into an underground complex 60 feet beneath the cairn.

Mace	fire symbol

Axe	water symbol Spear air symbol

Broad sword	earth symbol

1. **Subterranean Chamber** This is a 70’ diameter octagonal chamber, with a 35’ ceiling apex and stone support ribs arching

from the eight corners of the room to a central pillar. The stairs are hewn into the heart of the pillar.

Herein is a gray luminescence that comes from all surfaces—floor, walls, ceiling and the square central column. The stone here is dull black, and upon the floor are inlaid strange and unreadable glyphs that seem to change shape when seen out of the corner of the eye. They have no pattern and change randomly. These are the markings of the ancient elemental entity of chaotic spawning.

As the characters survey their surroundings, they notice a faint color to each of the stone slabs found in the niches in the cardinal directions of this chamber.

Reddish	north

Bluish	east

Pale gray	south Yellow-brown west

On each stone slab is carved the following:

_The final resting place of Archdruid _Dycott _Grover Woe to him who disturbs This hallowed rest._

Unhallowed is more correct. Woe indeed to any party that happens to open two or more of the blocking slabs at the same time. The elementals will not fight each other, only the trespassers in the octagonal chamber. Of course the characters need to figure a way to get the stone slabs open.

If a party loses one or more members and flees upwards, the elementals do not pursue them. The elementals simply return to their nurturing room which allows them access to their own plane. Upon any character’s return to the octagonal chamber, the freed elementals issue forth and attack on the 3rd round, as it takes a round to become aware of them and another to fully materialize.

1. **North **Tomb **Chamber This is a 30’ x 30’ chamber with a 20’ high ceiling. The entry is blocked by a slab of reddish granite. It opens only at the touch of the copper torch as its key. If any other key is touched to the door, that object vanishes back to the altar stone from whence it came, delivering 4d8 harm to all within 20 feet of it. As soon as the slab opens, the fire elemental inside attacks.

There is nothing in the chamber other than a very large, flawless ruby (worth 2,000gp) hidden in the exact center of the chamber under a small, octagonal floor stone. This acts as a gateway to the elemental’s own plane, but when the elemental is destroyed the link will be closed.

Fire Elemental, lesser (Its vital stats are: HD 8d10, HP 64, AC 18, neutral. Its prime attributes are: physical. It has two attacks a round with fiery arms that deliver 8+d8 points of damage. It can also cast each, once per day, pyrotechnics and spark storm [as sleet storm except with sparks] as an 8th level druid. The elemental can only be damaged by magically-enhanced weapons or spells.)

1. **East Tomb Chamber This is a 30’ x 30’ chamber with a 20’ high ceiling. The entry is blocked by a slab of bluish granite. It will open only at the touch of the silver baton as its key. If any other key is touched to the door, that object is transported back to the altar stone from whence it came, delivering 4d8 points of damage to all within 20 feet of the door. As soon as the slab opens, the water elemental inside attacks.

The floor of much of this room is sunken, and it holds eight feet of water. Unlike the other “tomb” chambers, however, this one has 5’ square slabs of stone at floor level in each corner. There is nothing in the chamber, other than a very large, flawless sapphire (worth 20,000gp) lying in the exact center of the pool. This acts as a gateway to its own plane, but when the elemental is destroyed the link is closed.

###### The Environs of Yggsburgh

Water elemental, lesser _(Its _eital _stats _are: _HD _8d10, _HP _64,_ _AC_ _18,_ _ueutral._ _Its_ _prime_ _attributes_ _are:_ _physical._ _It_ _has_ _two_ _attacks a rouud with watery arms that delieer 8+d8 poiuts of_ _damage. _It _cau _also _cast _each, _ouce _per _day, _ice _storm _aud _sleet storm _as _au _8th _leeel _druid. _The _elemeutal _cau _ouly _be _damaged by magically-euhauced weapous or spells.)_

There is also a secret door in the room. Discovery of this hidden portal is difficult, so magical means are the most likely method by which it will be located. All search checks are made at -10. Its triggering mechanism is a slight depression in the floor that must be pressed strongly down to activate. At that time, the wall section to the north swings inwards. If the depression is pressed again, that stone panel closes, and one to the east opens. A third pressure closes it. The door leads to area 6, below.

1. **South **Tomb **Chamber This is a 30’ x 30’ chamber with a 20’ high ceiling. The entry is blocked by a slab of pale gray granite. It opens only at the touch of the iron hook as its key. If any other key is touched to the door, that object is transported to the altar stone from whence it came, causing 4d8 damage to all within 20 feet of it. As soon as the slab opens, the air elemental inside attacks.

There is nothing in the chamber other than a very large, flawless diamond (worth 2,000gp) hidden in the exact center of the place under a small, octagonal floor stone. This acts as a gateway to the elemental’s own plane, but when the elemental is destroyed the link closes.

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

1. **The Black Crypt This crypt area consists of a 20’ x 30’ antechamber and a 30’ x 50’ main room, all with a 30’ high ceiling. As the bi-directional secret door opens to the north, a hollow, whispering voice is heard saying: “You fools are determined to find death even when it is carefully hidden from you. Enter then and be damned!”

As the party progresses northwards in the passage, any light sources they employ dim to half their usual radiance. When they are in the middle of the 20’-wide alcove running east, they are attacked by the guardians of the area, twelve penumbrate shadows! These creatures are arrayed in a line six across and two ranks deep. As their spears are long, any character in melee range is subject to two attacks, one coming from the second row of penumbrate shadows.

Penumbrate shadow, involuntary x12 _(Their_ _eital_ _stats_ _are:_ _HD _4d8, _HP _22, _AC _18, _ueutral _eeil. _Their _prime _attributes _are:_ _meutal. If they successfully touch someoue, they draiu 1d4 poiuts_ _of streugth.)_

1. **The Red Crypt This crypt has a 30’ x 30’ antechamber and a 50’ x 30’ main room, all with a 30’ high ceiling. Here is the place where the body of Dycott Grover lies in undecayed state. The wicked former Archdruid is at last brought to bay when the heroic party enters this secret place.

Entering from the east, the characters are in a corridor of blood- red stone that seems to have been fused and smoothed, giving it a polished surface. The composition of the entire area is of this nature.

A great burial vault of black granite is located near the far (east) wall. It is 12’ long, 8’ wide, and 6’ high. It has a 1’ thick slab serving as the lid.

A throne-like chair and ornate table are set before the vault. There are a gold ewer, cup, and plate on the tabletop worth 1,2500gp, 750gp and 500gp respectively. A small human bone lies beside the plate.

On the far wall, behind the vault, is a tapestry of 12’ width and 10’ length that is embroidered with a woodland scene of strangely twisted oak trees.

Along the south wall is a desk and plain chair. Upon the desktop are several ink bottles (ink of black, sepia, blue, green, and red), 10 quill pens, and a stack of what appears to be 20 vellum sheets. These latter are made of human skin that no character of good alignment will touch when so identified. A sand cellar, candle, and sealing wax are also here.

During those times that Dycott Grover returns to his body, he casts an animate rock spell upon the lid of the burial vault and has it moved aside. Arising from the couch therein, he goes to the tapestry upon the east wall and speaks a command word, after which the tapestry becomes a portal. He steps into it by touching the twisted oak embroidered thereon. He is then transported into the tree, steps out, and is able to roam about outside. So far into evil has he sunk that when active in human form, Dycott Grover performs unspeakable acts, including murder and cannibalism.


The ghouls and ghasts haunt the area because he leaves them fine meals. The wicked humanoids regard him as a quasi-deity, bringing him captives so as to keep him from killing them.

Should the party find a way to remove the lid of the vault they find the following:

The unnaturally preserved body of Dycott Grover, dressed in Druidical robes, is lying upon an upholstered couch, a scroll in one hand and a small crystal ball in the other. The scroll has the druid spell ‘transmute rock to mud’ written on it. The transparent quartz ball is enchanted, so that when squeezed a magical flame like that of a large candle burns within it, shedding light accordingly. This effect ends when the sphere is squeezed a second time. These were placed here as safety measures by the former Archdruid, to ensure that when in his body he could leave the vault.

**Ring: On the forefinger of his right hand is a large gold signet ring. This is the seal of Dycott Grover. It is now a cursed thing that imparts a -1 on all dice rolls (including damage) for the character who wears it, until a remove curse spell is cast upon him and the ring removed.

**Chest:** Upon the chest of the body is a pectoral of five horn plates. This is a +5 magical pectoral of protection, but it cannot be used with any other magical protections, armor included.

**Pouch:** Attached to a girdle, clasped around the waist of the corpse, is an ornate pouch (spell components inside) and a curved dagger (magic, +3).

**Staff:** Beside the couch is a staff of gnarled oak. This is a druidical staff of the forest that confers a +3 bonus in combat, and to wisdom saving throws, but for druids only.

**Trunk: At the foot of the couch is a moderately sized trunk. It has no lock, but is instead a well-made trap. Trap checks are made at -5. If the lid is raised, 10 specially preserved holly berry fireseeds placed in an open compartment, a projection from the inner side of the top, will fall out and burst into flame. These cause 10d8 points of damage to each character within a 20-foot radius. Further, all non-magical, flammable items inside the vault are destroyed by the ensuing fire, the corpse included.

Inside the trunk are many neatly folded items of apparel that belonged to Dycott Grover. Atop them are his golden sickle (250gp value) and a silver harvesting bowl (120gp value). Under them are six scrolls of druid spells he has written (four spells per scroll, their nature left to the Castle Keeper to decide), a small wooden box containing more Druidical spell components, and a leather purse in which are 50 gold coins.

Not expecting to ever have his special hiding place discovered by enemies, the former Archdruid has no special defenses prepared herein. He will thus confront intruders in his shadow form, and fights them desperately. He confronts the intruders from a position just above the main portion of the chamber, the place where his physical body is carefully protected inside a stone vault, whose granite lid weighs more than a ton. Dycott, a penumbrate

shadow, attacks the characters at the earliest possible moment. When he is wounded, he casts healing spells upon himself until they are depleted. His scimitar has a divine connection to his body and falls to dust as soon as he is killed.

Penumbrate shadow, voluntary _(Its _eital _stats _are: _HD _15d10,_ _HP _142, _AC _18, _ueutral _eeil. _Its _prime _attributes _are: _meutal. _It_ _carries a magically euhauced +3 scimitar.

This completes the details of The Unholy Ringstones.

#### Bandits, Thieves and Highwaymen


**Location: Dunfalcon Pike

**Encounter **Chart: Main Road

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference:** Yggsburgh, Dunfalcon Pike

**Towns **of **Note: Villages of Dunfalcon Pike

The Dunfalcon Pike is a well-maintained and patrolled highway stretching from Yggsburgh to the city of Dunfalcon. It passes through the Barony of Redfort, County of Kallent, County of Herdley and thence into the territory of the Free City of Dunfalcon. Since aristocrats depend on it for travel and income, they actually maintain it and send out occasional patrols to see that robbers do not make it too hazardous for commercial traffic. There are sufficient settlements along the road to make travel along its considerable length possible without great hardship. There are five hamlets and numerous thorps between Yggsburgh and Dunfalcon. The hamlets have coaching inns, making the overall trip comfortable. However, travel along the road is not without its problems. Robbers and highwaymen do brave the effort of taking loot from unsuspecting merchants or nobles, despite the chances of being caught. Travelers along the road are not always the most pleasant of individuals.

###### Adventure Hooks

It is requested by the Lord Mayor that the party journey by coach to Dunfalcon to deliver a sealed box to the Lord Mayor of that city. All expenses will be paid, of course, and for their time and trouble, the bold adventurers will be given a fete and special mention upon their return to Yggsburgh.

This is an agreed-upon ruse by the Lord Mayor and his ministers. A gang of highway robbers has been plaguing the pike, and they seem to know when to lie low and avoid patrols. However, the Lord Mayor thinks that a team of tough characters traveling unbeknownst to the outlaws should draw them out. The party can then lay them low, as it is believed the adventurers will not surrender to mere bandits and may take them easily or with little effort. They secretly let it be known that a dispatch of great import is being delivered to Dunfalcon, and go so far as to describe the characters making such a trip.

###### The Environs of Yggsburgh

There are 9 highwaymen in this band. They are a nefarious lot, highly proficient and experienced at their job. The band is led by “Lord Ollie.” He and his fellows are described in greater detail below. The Castle Keeper must establish the level of the highwayman gang to suit the party’s strength. It should be a tough challenge for them, as the bandits are very capable.

The highwaymen will either stop the coach the characters are riding in, or rob them afoot or mounted as they travel to Dunfalcon. How the gang of highwaymen stops the coach or ambushes the party is left to the Castle Keeper and must suit the moment at hand. To enact this, the robbers might have the road blocked, use a ruse such as a disabled wagon or an injured traveler in need of aid, or simply ride onto the road and block the path. Immediately after, Shadow casts a slumber spell, which is likely followed up by a light spell in an effort to blind the passengers and make them easy targets for missiles. An active resister will then be treated to a charm spell, after which they will all be robbed.

###### The Highwaymen

#### Death Stalks the Night


**Location:** Menhir Hills Road

**Encounter **Chart: Main Road

**Zagyg Adventure Reference: Menhir Hills, Menhir Hills Road, Utford Ferry, Hawfair Green and Stonewyck

**Towns **of **Note: Hawfair

The Menhir Hills Road winds through the Menhir Hills past Utford Ferry, Hawfair Green and Stonewyck, the latter being the manor of Sir Alec of Gaxhill. As one might expect, the region and road are fraught with danger. Travel can occasionally be perilous, so care must be taken while moving along this road. The inhabitants are themselves careful, as there are often deadly beasts that stalk the night and the day.


###### Adventure Hook

At Hawfair’s public house, the Leaping Trout Tavern, the proprietor, Stanley “Stout” Shepard, assesses the characters when they arrive. He is trying to decide if they can be depended upon to rid the town of some beast. If Stout is impressed by the party, he mentions that the community has been paralyzed with fear at night because some sort of creature is prowling about killing watchdogs and livestock. The folk have taken to locking their doors at sunset and not coming out until dawn. This is bad for farming and for his business. Unless the problem is solved, he explains, there will be no fair in the autumn. If the characters agree to find this creature, Stout offers them free lodging and food for a week. Will the adventurers accept his hospitality, stay and venture forth after dark to find and destroy whatever monster is haunting Hawfair Green?

The Castle Keeper needs to decide what the prowling creature is, by determining what would be most interesting or challenging to the characters. The following are some possibilities. None of the creatures below will have any treasure on its person. If the Castle Keeper wishes, a ranger might be able to track the monster back to its lair, and some form of valuables be discovered there (and perhaps other dangers as well).

**Werewolf: A gigantic werewolf from the Ashwood is roaming the countryside eating livestock. Is it a member of the village or from some nearby community, and how long before it takes a life?

Werewolf _(This _creature’s _eital _stats _are: _HD _5-8, _HP _8 _per _hit dice, _AC _16, _chaotic _eeil. _The _creature’s _prime _attributes _are:_ _physical.

**Wight: This undead abomination roams freely at night. Its barrow, hidden in the nearby hills, was perhaps opened by a curious and foolish local.

The creature’s prime attributes are: meutal._ _It _cau _make _2 _claw _attacks _a _rouud _for _2d4 _damage _each, _or _a_ _bite _attack _for _1d6 _damage. _The _damage _iuflicted _by _a _bite _attack_ _is permaueut aud cauuot be healed.

**Marsh ghoul:** This hungry marsh monster from the Greypools Mire is akin to a cross between a ghoul and a mobile heap of vegetation and slime. It is coming ever closer to the village.

The Environs of Yggsburgh



Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

#### Frogs and Fogs


**Location: Old Castle Track

**Encounter **Chart:** Track

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Castle Zagyg

**Towns **of **Note: None

This byway is both difficult and dangerous to travel! It is peopled with nothing but robbers, roving bands of humanoids, savage beasts, and hungry monsters awaiting any who dare travel here. All sensible folk shun the Old Castle Track. This overgrown lane wends its way 15 miles into the woodland to end at a bluff overlooking the False Urt River and Castle Zagyg.

###### Adventure Hook

Any party insisting on forging ahead on this overgrown pathway is in for a rude awakening. Random encounters should be checked at least once an hour. When the characters are 5 miles distant from the road’s end, check for random encounters twice an hour. Often, the sounds of combat bring other curious monsters to examine what is occurring. During any combat, roll for another random encounter. Minimally, three encounters will occur along this track.

Should the party continue on to catch a glimpse of Castle Zagyg after such a violent beginning they will be rewarded. With a curse! The first curse upon Castle Zagyg is a powerful one. When first viewed from the Old Castle Track, every character that lays eyes upon it must make a saving throw at -15 or be polymorphed into a frog and transported to the Menhir Hills Road. This polymorph lasts for 24 hours and only occurs once.

[Note: The intent of these encounters is to prevent the characters from trying to gain entry to Castle Zagyg prior to its publication. So treat the party with ease and try other, less deadly avenues of dissuasion prior to the more confrontational methods mentioned above!]

#### Reconnaissance


**Location: River High Road

**Encounter **Chart: Main Road

**Zagyg Adventure Reference:** Dunfalcon Pike, River Nemo, Moatgate, Bowbridge, Great Leech Marsh, East Uplands, March Road, King’s Highway

**Towns **of **Note: Bowbridge

The River High Road is the eastern extension of Dunfalcon Pike. Unlike the Dunfalcon Pike, the River High Road is on the north bank of the River Nemo. It passes the Deerwood, thence through the Broadview Valley, on to the Upper Nemo River, and finally crosses the South Eel River at Bowbridge. The region is sparsely settled and the eastern portion is not under the control of Yggsburgh. Beyond Bowbridge the River High Road becomes known as the March Road, and then the King’s Highway.


###### Adventure Hook

The Lord Mayor desires a reconnaissance of the River High Road and its extension eastwards. Will the bold adventurers undertake such a trek? They must ride for as many days as it takes them to reach the border of the kingdom to the northeast, and make notes of all they see—both the usual and unusual. If they agree, they will be furnished horses as mounts (or spare mounts as applicable), a cook with provisions on a pair of pack mules, and 500gp each in coin for expenses incurred.

Besides random encounters, it is suggested that humanoids of various sorts be a problem in the wilderness beyond Bowbridge. The Castle Keeper is encouraged to create details such as tribal affiliation, territories and encampments for these humanoids. Further, the Castle Keeper must create many details to feed the minds of the characters with information for this portion of the trek.

About halfway along the March Road, the party is stopped by a patrol of a score or so of mounted soldiers serving Francois, Duke of Lorrez. The march they are riding through belongs to Lorrez. Being considered spies is the least of the likely outcomes of this chance encounter.

This is an excellent opportunity for some clever roleplay on the part of the players, and perhaps some derring-do as well. If the duke and his minions are particularly arrogant and demeaning to the party, perhaps one or the other will thereafter encourage the rude humanoids on the border of the march to do some constructive raiding…

#### Pool of the Little People


**Location: Lakeham Lane

**Encounter **Chart: Track

**Zagyg Adventure Reference:** River High Road, Quarry Track, Broadview Valley, Lakepens Hills, Lake Woods, South Eel River, Bigfish Lake, Garham

**Towns **of **Note: Garham

Lakeham Lane winds its way up through the Broadview Valley and the Lake Woods to end at the community of Garham. Although most goods to and from Garham are shipped along the river, there is a fair bit of traffic on the road as well.

###### Adventure Hook

When traveling along this track and passing through the Lake Woods, the party detects faint, tinkling laughter and the sound of high-pitched voices. To investigate, they have to move about 100 yards westward through the trees before they come upon a small glen, with a spring-fed pool some 15 feet in diameter. A rivulet runs off of this pool to the southeast with a pleasant plashing sound. Dappled with sunlight, the ground soft with bent grass and thick moss, many flowers and herbs making the air here redolent with fragrances, this place is quite lovely. There is no one in sight, but there are unusual ripples on the surface of the pool.

If the characters are aggressive, have drawn weapons or seem threatening, they will be attacked by the convocation of “Little People” watching invisibly from the surrounding flora. If they are

###### The Environs of Yggsburgh

restrained and seem friendly and accommodating, one or another of the bolder “Little People” appears and queries the group as to why they are here.

If an attack is made, the party is peppered with the “Little People’s” arrows of sleeping until they all fall asleep. They will awaken back on the lane, with their clothing inside out and switched to others, possessions likewise. If this incites them to seek revenge, the next time they near the pool, they are again attacked, this time damaged in the process of being sent to sleep. They awake with their weapons missing. The “Little People” have removed them and hidden them far away in the woods. In the meantime, the “Little People” will have departed this area permanently.

If amicable communications are established, the “Little People” frolic around the characters, make rude jests about them, tweak and pinch them in a friendly, but most likely irritating, manner. If the party remains good-natured, their “hosts” give each of them a magical “favor.” The following are examples, but should be expanded upon as necessary.

**Dust **of **Invisibility: When sprinkled on a person, this bag of magical fairy dust makes them invisible as the spell. There is enough for 4 medium-sized persons.

**Dust of Sleeping:** When sprinkled on a person, this bag of magical fairy dust makes them fall asleep as the sleep spell cast at 12th level. There is enough for 3 applications.

**Darts **of **Wounding: These small darts cause 3d4+3 damage and impart a +3 to hit.

The pool which the fairies are gathered around has accrued some fairy magic. When a full draught is taken, it heals 6-24 points of damage. If the characters have been friendly, the “Little People” allow the characters to take as much as they want from the pool. One must drink a full flask of the water in order for it to impart the healing once it has been taken more than 50 yards from the pool.

If the fairies are treated harshly, after they depart the area the pool loses its fairy magic and no longer heals the wounded.

#### Rock Quarries and River Wardens


**Location: Quarry Track

**Encounter **Chart: Track

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Menhir Hills, Bigfish Lake, Greenridge, Garham

**Towns **of **Note: Garham, Marblestead, Hewerton

The Quarry Track leads northwest out of Garham to follow Bigfish Lake before heading northeasterly. It winds through the Greenridge, and thence north into the oft dangerous Menhir Hills. At this juncture is an area of hard-packed clay and gravel running to the shore of Bigfish Lake. The stones around here have been placed to form a jetty projecting about 50 feet into the water. This is where barges are loaded with rock and taken from the quarries northeastwards.

After running about three miles in this direction, the road forks. The left fork goes about eight miles into the hills, arriving at the hamlet of Marblestead where quarrymen make a living selling stone to Garham and Yggsburgh. A couple of miles further north is another hamlet known as Hewerton. It is likewise a quarry.

See Environs Encounter 47 for information about the right fork in the road. See Marblestead and Hewerton in Part III, Communities of Yggsburgh.

###### Adventure Hook

As the party is traveling along the track, they see a fight taking place at the jetty where quarried stone is loaded aboard barges. It seems as if some very fine serpentine blocks meant for delivery to the Lord Mayor of Yggsburgh are about to be stolen by a gang of river pirates. If the characters intervene, and succeed in defeating or at least driving off these robbers, they will be commended by all the local populace. They will then be given an audience and reward banquet, naming them as “Upholders of Right,” when they are in Yggsburgh and become known to its officials.

Adjust the pirates’ numbers and stats to make a suitable challenge for the party. If they wipe out the pirates, the ship is their prize, but unless they can sail it, it is virtually useless to them. The ship is a small, two-masted schooner. The owner of the barge being attacked will offer the characters 1,000gp for it on the spot. If it is taken down to Yggsburgh, it will fetch 3,000gp at auction.


The pirates are captained by the cutthroat Gold Hal. His woman, Bloody Rosie, acts as his first mate. This piratical and attractive first mate is not a person to trust. They are aided by George the Finger, the raiders’ shifty spell-caster, who is ready to use his magic to defeat the opposition, but not likely to stand and face personal threats. The rest of the crew is a motley collection of roustabouts and river rats.

#### Hurling Boulders


**Location: East Hillway

**Encounter **Chart: Track

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Menhir Hills, Bigfish Lake, Greenridge, Garham, Scragwick, Falsford, North Eel River

**Towns **of **Note: Garham, Scragwick

The East Hillway runs from its fork with the Quarry Track for about 12 miles before it crosses the North Eel River at Falsford. About five miles east of the ford is a hamlet named Scragwick, inhabited by 300 or so unfriendly hillmen. Beyond Scragwick, the East Hillway runs on for many leagues to the east-northeast, passing through a few unnamed thorps and a hamlet or two before entering a badland of scrub. This wilderness is inhabited mainly by humanoids, monsters, and wild animals—an altogether unpleasant place.

###### Adventure Hook

Traveling through the hills along the East Hillway, the party encounters three hill giants—a male, female, and half-grown offspring. The male comes rushing forth with ferocity, but holds back from hurling a boulder—he simply stops and shakes his great club menacingly at the party. If they can and do attempt to parley, they will learn that this family of giants has fled south to escape an ancient black drake that drove them from their home cave. Should the party be willing to attack the black drake, the male hill giant will certainly assist them in so doing, providing they promise to allow his mate and son to dwell in the cave after the drake is slain.

If the male hill giant, Voolbar, is alive and above 50% of his hit points, and the PC party seems sufficiently weakened by losses and damage from fighting the black drake, the giant will signal his mate and offspring to let boulders fly at the party while he bashes away with his club. If he is alive, but weak, or the party strong, Voolbar will give hearty thanks and offer the party members all the copper and silver coins they can carry away, plus, “one nice gem each!” If they demand more, he will moan and blubber and ask how he can retain the respect of, and care for, his poor family if they steal all his wealth, while Shuldit pretends to tear her hair and wail, and young Urjato throws himself upon the coin heap as if to protect it from harm, meanwhile attempting to conceal the drake-borne gold coffer under the heap of copper coins. The Castle Keeper can play this scene for all it’s worth, but Voolbar will not risk dying at this juncture, so in the end a sternly greedy party can carry off whatever they wish and are able to manage.

If Voolbar has been slain, Shuldit and Urjato will be wailing with grief, begging the party to restore him to life, and meanwhile crying aloud how little chance they will have to survive without vast wealth to offer to another giant to protect them.

**Treasure: The dragon has lost its own horde to a marauding copper dragon, carrying away only a small gold coffer worth 750gp. It is filled with 100 base 50gp cut gems, and 12 pieces of excellent jewelry worth 250-25,000gp apiece. The giants had accumulated the following, now possessed by the black drake: 100gp worth of copper coins, 1000gp worth of silver coins, 25,000gp worth of gold coins, 20 base 25gp cut gems, 6 pieces of jewelry worth 50-500gp apiece, a silver scroll tube (worth 15gp) with a scroll of 4 wizard spells inscribed on it (random), and two magical draughts whose effects are to be discovered at random.

The stats for the monsters concerned are:

Voolbar, male hill giant _(HD _9, _HP _72, _AC _16, _CE; _large, _hurl_ _boulders to 90’ distauce for 2-16+8 damage, club 2-16+8)_

#### Danger in Dradvil


**Location: Purple Tower Road

**Encounter **Chart: Main Road

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: South Pastures, Townbridge, Edgar the Marquis of Talworth, Uvoll Darktarn, Yggsburgh, The Purple Tower, Drab Hill, Dradvil

**Towns **of **Note: Dradvil, The Purple Tower

The Purple Tower Road runs south from the Townbridge at the Free Town of Yggsburgh, some 12 miles east-southeast across the plain known as the South Pastures, to a point where it leaves the map. Some 20 miles further along in an easterly direction, it comes to the frontier stronghold of Uvoll, a sly wizard who is the chief henchman of Edgar, the current Marquis of Talworth.

###### Adventure Hook

When traveling eastwards on the Purple Tower Road, the party overtakes a caravan of merchants. There are 10 wagons and four carts in the train. The merchant in charge, Frank Zeigler, urges the party to stay with the caravan. He offers them food along the way, and 5gp per day each when the caravan reaches Dradvil in but three days’ time. He is worried because of the large amount of valuable goods being transported there, consigned to Lord Uvoll, who has pledged payment upon their arrival in Dradvil. Although merchant Zeigler doesn’t say, he intimates that the value of the goods being transported is large indeed.

That is so. Each wagon is carrying an average, at wholesale costs, of 3,750gp worth of armor, weapons, and luxury goods meant for Uvoll’s castle—imported hand-woven carpets, silk cloth, furs, silver table service sets, fine liquors, spices, perfume, objects d’art, etc. The purchase orders Zeigler and his three fellow merchants carry on their persons total 6,000,000gp, payable by Lord Uvoll upon delivery.

Of course, the dishonest nobleman has no intention of paying out so vast a sum, although his treasure affords him the ability to do so. He has instead hired a band of orcs to attack the caravan, kill the merchants and guards, and bring the lot to a small wood near Dradvil. Here, Lord Uvoll has promised the humanoid chief he will paid over 500,000gp in gold and gems, plus all the silver each of his men can carry, as payment for the service rendered.

The foolish orc believes Lord Uvoll. The nobleman will be waiting in ambush at the rendezvous with his henchmen and castle guard, ready with spells and weaponry to exterminate the remaining humanoids. He will gain the whole of the goods at no more cost than the effort to set up the evil scheme, and some barrels of beer and a fat ox given to the orcs to convince them to undertake the attack. That is, unless the players intercede to stop the unwholesome affair.

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh



###### The Caravaneers

There are ten wagons in the caravan. Each wagon has two caravan guards in it (caravan guard I and caravan guard). One acts as a driver. The caravan is further guarded by Walter Green, the head scout, and his aid Velitrian Underwood. There are ten mounted guards traveling with the caravan.

#### Tolls and Trolls


**Location: Bowbridge

**Encounter **Chart: Main Road

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: River High Road, River Nemo

**Communities **of **Note: Bowbridge Toll House

The Bowbridge allows passage of the River Nemo on the River High Road. It is very old and has no toll, because it is on the frontier between the petty states of the region. There is an old tollkeeper’s cottage on the east side of the bridge, where a fisherman and his family live.

###### Adventure Hook

As the party passes or stops by the cottage, one or more trolls (depending on the party size and strength) will be seen approaching the place, clearly intent on killing and devouring the people therein. The heroic thing to do is to immediately enter the fray, and prevent the humanoids from making this a…troll bridge! (Sorry, but the punning opportunity was just too much for me to resist.)

If the party defeats the trolls, an old woman who saw the action from the farmstead hastens up and gives each adventurer a little packet of four cookies. (No, they are clearly not toll house cookies!) They are imbued with herbal magic, though, and eating one will restore from 7-12 HPs, or else make an unwounded consumer gain +1 to attack and damage for 4 hours’ time. The kindly old granny is a wise woman, and quite pleased to explain the effects of her baked goodies if asked to do so.

Troll, variable number _(HD _7d10, _HP _5-10 _per _HD, _AC _16,_ _CE; _PA _physical. _The _troll _gets _two _claw _attacks _for _6-9 _damage, aud oue bite for 6-12 damage. It also regeuerates 1 hit poiut per_ _rouud.)_

#### The Ferryman


**Location: Utford

**Encounter **Chart: Main Road

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Menhir Hills Road, Urt River

**Communities **of **Note**: Yggsburgh, Utford Ferryman Cottage

Six and a half miles north of Yggsburgh, the Menhir Hills Road crosses the Urt River at a place known as Urtford. The main means of crossing is a large raft that ferries vehicles, animals, and men from one side of the river to the other. The fee is 5cp per person (including luggage carried in hand, or small animals such as a goat, pig, or sheep), 10cp for a large animal such as a cow or horse, and 15cp for each wheel of a vehicle. Carts are more expensive, costing 3sp, with carriages, coaches, and wagons 6sp to carry across the river. People and goods within a vehicle are carried at no extra charge, but a rider who stays mounted is still charged the 5cp toll.

The ferryman’s cottage is on the south bank of the river. In addition to it and a barn and animal pens, there is a long shed in which passengers can wait. They are served food, and cider or buttermilk to drink, by the owner’s wife and children. All fare is ordinary, but inexpensive at 2sp per person and 5cp for a pint of drink.

###### The Environs of Yggsburgh

###### Adventure Hook

While being ferried across the river on a raft, the towline breaks and the raft begins to drift downriver. Can the daring team of adventurers use their abilities to save themselves and the other passengers aboard from being swept downstream and likely capsizing?

The Castle Keeper should prepare for any number of the various options the players will try in an attempt to forestall floating further downriver. In general, the river presents a challenge level of 4 should swimming or other activities of such nature be used.

#### River Rats


**Location: Eelsford

**Encounter **Chart: Main Road

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Urt River, River Nemo

**Communities **of **Note: Eelford Ferry

The Eelsford crosses the Urt River. It is not a proper ferry, but rather a ferrying place. There is a barge here serviced by a ferryman. As well, there is an establishment called the Two Pikes Tavern, with Kevin Glenward as its proprietor.

###### Adventure Hook

When the party is in the tavern, a gang of bullies arrives, begins making trouble by threatening the owner and patrons, and then demands all their money in a robbery. The Castle Keeper should adjust the level of the bullies to best challenge the characters. A party of bullies is outlined below.

###### Robbers: The Highwaymen

#### Slaves, or Good Eating?


**Location: Fallsford

**Encounter **Chart: Track

**Zagyg **Adventure **Reference: Menhir Hills, East Hillway, North Eel River, Bigfish Lake

**Communities **of **Note: Nastwick

The East Hillway crosses the North Eel River about two miles above Bigfish Lake, at a place where the water passes over bedrock and is thus very broad, no less than 350 feet wide but only two feet deep. There is a hamlet of rather unfriendly hillmen a bit more than five miles east of the ford.

###### Adventure Hook

As the adventurers come to this crossing point they see a small group of people—wounded men, women, and a few children, splashing westward in the ford. When asked what the problem is, these folk will relate that they are fleeing from their village, Nastwick, because a band of raiding humanoids came in the night and took the community by surprise. The surviving inhabitants are locked up in the village shrine. They will be killed and eaten, or else enslaved tomorrow when the humanoids recover from their excess celebrating. So the party is to seek out the village and have a set-to of characters vs. humanoids. The treasure found will be typical of a village, plus whatever those humanoids selected by the Castle Keeper to be the opponents of the party carry with them.

###### Raiding Humanoids

The Castle Keeper should determine the size and nature of the humanoids’ raiding force. However, a group of gnoles is supplied below as an example.

Ogre Chief _(This _creature’s _eital _stats _are: _HD _5d12, _HP _46,_ _AC 15, Chaotic Eeil. Its prime attributes are: physical. It carries _a leather shirt, two-hauded sword aud 40gp. Special: This ogre_ _receiees _a _+6 _bouus _to _damage _rolls.)_

#### Gaxhill, Stonewyck and Estates


**Location: Menhir Hills

**Type: Keep and Village

**Encounters: Thorp or Hamlet Green

Castle Gaxhill is the residence of Sir Alec. It sits beside the village of Stnewyck and is located north of Yggsburgh along the Menhir Hills Road. Sir Alec holds estates to the south of Castle Gaxhill also. Besides Stonewyck, these holdings amount to 16 manors and four villages, three thorps, land in rent and freeholds having on it 11 farms and a horse breeder. So he is master of some 2,000 folk counting the woods-dwellers to the north who acknowledge him as their lord and serve him in return for his protection.

###### Castle Gaxhill

Sir Alec dwells here with his family. Within the courtyard of the castle are a smithy and carpentry shop, and some 24 craftsmen and servants all of whom dwell inside the extensive fortification’s walls. In his service are his chaplain, the Pious Roland d’Argent, an advisor and wizard, Arovad Mondegryf and the steward, Owen Bailey, amongst others. Sir Alec’s armorial bearing is an escutcheon quartered green and gold with a white goose passant on the green quarters and a green tower on the gold ones. Servants in waiting wear tabards quartered green and deep gold. Sir Alec has a substantial garrison at the castle and can also call up a militia from the surrounding areas to bolster his forces if necessary. See the Appendix I, Orders of Battle, Gaxhill for details on the non- player characters and troops in residence at the Castle.

This most able knight is well-to-do from the agricultural income of his manors and woodland produce of timber, furs, and game. He hunts in the Great Hillwood, so the manor woodlots are used more by villains than by their lord and master. This, and the fact that he does not demand heavy shares and frequent labor service, makes them most loyal to Sir Alec. Sir Alec has a secret strongbox in the castle with 10 potions inn it 4 of which are healing elixirs restoring 4-16 HP each, 10 pieces of jewelry with a worth of 1,000-6,000gp each, 100 gems of 5-100gp value each, 100 gp, and 500sp.

###### Stonewyck

This place is so named for the castle and the stone houses around it. It lies outside the knight’s fortification. It is a collection of 18 regular stone buildings with about 160 residents. There are two freehold farms at the southern edge of the community, one on the left and the other on the right side of the road. One tavern with attached brewhouse, The Knight’s Arms, is on the right side of the road along the lane leading up to the castle (called Castle Lane). There are also a sawyer’s shop and a stone mason’s residence flanking the tavern. Also along Castle Lane is the Shrine of the Unknown Paladin. There are 13 other dwellings of hunters

and woodsmen in Stonewyck. These latter include two located between the western farm and the sawyer’s place, one to the north of the stone mason’s building and the other 10 divided equally along either side of Castle Lane.

###### The Knight’s Arms

**Encounter Tables:** Small Tavern Common Room, Outside the Small Tavern

There is a sign in front of the place with an escutcheon quartered green and gold with a white goose passant on the green quarters and a green tower on the gold ones. The proprietor of this establishment is Helmut Chambers. He, along with his wife Karin and four children, do most of the work running the place. Helmut keeps a club and a dagger underneath the bar. There is 180gp hidden in the tavern.

Helmut Chamber _(He is a chaotic good, humau, 6th leeel rauger._ _His _eital _stats _are: _HP _35, _AC _13. _His _prime _attributes _are: _str,_ _cou, _cha. _He _carries _studded _leather, _club, _dagger, _lougsword,_ _lougbow _aud _15gp.)_

###### Shrine of the Unknown Paladin

This is not a shrine for regular worship. The inhabitants of Stonewyck attend religious services in the castle chapel. However, it is a special sort of shrine. The building is only 12 feet wide, 14 feet deep, and has a peaked timber roof that rises five feet above the 12-foot high whitewashed walls. The interior is unfurnished save for a lone vigil light and a memorial to this venerable martyr. To the right of the entry there is a contribution box hung from the wall. Those who stop here generally leave a small coin or two towards the upkeep of the shrine.

Where did this shrine come from? It was 112 years ago that a powerful demon lord was accidentally released from an imprisonment and began wreaking havoc on the lands around. It

###### The Environs of Yggsburgh

engaged in acts of unspeakable cruelty as it pressed along. At this very site, a lone wandering paladin chose to stand against this vile fiend. Nobody knows who the hero was, as he didn’t give out his name nor did he wear or bear any coat of arms. Perhaps he was on a secret mission, took some vow of humility or was an outcast. Know one knows. Whatever the case, this valiant warrior was able to destroy the demon lord’s material form but at the cost of his own life.

The celestial forces intervened and destroyed his body with his soul ascending to a heavenly peace. This noble sacrifice and subsequent intervention was noted by the populace and the local clergy erected a small shrine of whitewashed field stone to this unknown paladin.

The shrine is maintained once a week by Roland d’Argent, Sir Alec’s chaplain. Its exterior and grounds cared for by the local residents. Otherwise, it is a place of quiet reflection. Holy men and pilgrims tend to pay tribute here when traveling through the area. The site is protected by the higher powers. The location is automatically hedged with a protection from evil effect, and is considered hallowed ground. Anybody attempting to vandalize or destroy the vigil light will automatically summon a deva who attack instantly those attempting such desecration.

For anyone who prays or meditates here, the Castle Keeper may award them a unique gift (or generally, a 1 on a d20 indicates a divine gift). If that person is pure of heart, is battling an overwhelming evil that threatens innocents and is willing to lay down his life to protect others, a miracle will be granted that can turn the tide in the character’s favor.

This gift is akin to a wish, but it can’t vanquish the foe itself. It can only aid the character. For instance, if a noble fighter was battling a powerful devil, the miracle wouldn’t banish or destroy the creature, but the fighter might find himself with the temporary abilities of a paladin and his sword transformed into a paladin’s holy sword. Whereas an actual paladin might gain temporary levels, a spellcaster might have his or her spells replenished, gain the assistance of a summoned celestial being, or have the ability to penetrate the fiend’s spell resistance. The castle Keeper should use their own judgment on this. This boon should only work one time for the individual (or entire adventuring group).

Otherwise, any character of good will stopping here and meditating for an hour gains the benefit of a blessing spell for the following 24 hours. Clerics gain the capacity to cast a single additional blessing spell on others in the 24 hours following.

Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

## Appendix A Developing Yggsburgh

Yggsburgh is a large town, of which only a small portion is developed. This leaves much room for the Castle Keeper to flesh out the city’s details according to their needs or desires. This section provides much of the requisite information to begin doing that. Copious notes and not a small amount of work might be necessary to accomplish this, but developing in small portions

should make the task easier.

###### Building Examples

A few floor plans for standard types of buildings found in the town are presented for use by the Castle Keeper. These can be used as templates to create specific building plans or serve as a base for playing without a formal building plan for an exact location, the Castle Keeper altering descriptions to suit the location and purpose of the structure.

The plans show buildings that are constructed with walls touching their neighbors, all the larger ones having light wells. Only about 20% of the town’s buildings are built thus. The majority have a space of about four feet between them, with only portions of the building touching the neighboring one in bay-like manner, with side windows looking down upon the gangway. (See Gangway below.)

###### City Villa

Note the fenced and gated light wells of approx. seven-foot depth at front and back. These are for servants and tradesmen to enter, and they allow light into the basement. In the case of such mansions being built with walls touching their neighbor, the gangway entrance will be accessed from the basement-level well, passing under front and back ground floor extensions that touch the next building, the central portion of the narrow passage open to the sky above, so that upper floors can have side windows that let in some light and air.

**Entrance:** The ground floor is four feet above sidewalk level and reached by a broad and shallow flight of stone stairs. All of the entrance doors will have barred grates that are closed, as are window shutters, and locked at night. There will be bell-pulls at each door. All windows will have stout shutters that are closed and latched at night.

1. Entrance to the staircase for serving staff to go to the first floor.
1. Entrance to the main staircase to the basement, useable by staff.
1. Rear lawn and garden area, possibly a stable beyond them on the alley. There will be a high wall along the sides of the property not walled off by a neighboring structure, and the back of the property will also have such a wall with spikes atop it, or else buildings that serve to wall off the alley in the same manner.


1. Optional dumbwaiter for bringing food up from the basement kitchen. If this exists it will ascend to the first floor, opening in the master bedroom parlor.

**Basement** The rooms here will be as follows: large—kitchen, servants’ hall (dining and lounge), store room; moderate—buttery, pantry, wine cellar; small—general food storage, furnace room, root cellar, silver vault, two water closets. Also: Moderate— butler’s and housekeepers bedrooms; very small bedrooms for other staff (four).

**First Floor** There will be four bedrooms with parlors, a ladies’ sitting room, a children’s play room, and three water closets on this floor.

**Second Floor** There will be four bedrooms with parlors, two bedrooms, and three water closets on this floor.

**Loft On this servants’ floor there will be four moderate bedrooms, six small bedrooms, a large dormitory room, an upper servants’ lounge, and three water closets.

This plan will also serve for somewhat larger structures. Room dimensions are not given, as the overall size of the structure might be larger, but general proportions will remain constant. For example, in a larger building where there were six feet added, there might be closets for outer garments included on either side of the Foyer, as the Water Closets are amply large as shown. In that case the Lounge would be six feet wider. Beyond that the greater width would enhance the Passage and Hallway breadth to six and seven and one-half feet respectively, as well as the east- west dimension of the Family Dining room and the Office by three feet each, or optionally all addition accrue to the Great Hall. Of course the Atrium would not lengthen in this case. If the increase were from 90 to 120 feet, adding 12 feet to the Atrium’s breadth would make sense, as the sides would each be nine feet wider. In such case the foyer would be six feet wider, have three-foot closets on either side, that adding 12 feet to the breadth of the Lounge to match the enlarged Atrium. The Dining Room and Salon would each be nine feet wider, the Game room and Library six feet broader, and the Passage and Hall three feet more broad. At the rear of the mansion six feet additional width might be given to the Family dining room, six to the Office (with three more feet for the Water Closet there) and all of the remaining 18 feet be included in the Great Hall dimensions.

As is usual, there is an assumption made that the wealthy will have such “modern” conveniences as some limited central heating, indoor plumbing with hot and cold running water, and waste disposal to community sewers. Similarly, some of the indoor lighting will be accomplished by magical means, candles serving ad much for ambience as for illumination.

###### Large Building

This structure might have any one of the following sorts of uses:

**Town Office Bureau** Floor plan as shown, with reception desks immediately in front of the entrance doorways, railings to either side, with waiting benches and gates to left and right. Front space occupied by various clerks. Stairs up leading to the most

important bureaucrats’ offices above, and on to a second floor or loft in which old records are stored. Under the staircases up are like ones leading down to lowest level workers desks and storage vaults for the most important records. In the central front area will be a small water closet in a corner. Desks for supervisory assistants, and behind them the offices of the two main supervisory clerks. Repeat this in the rear portion where the Hallways lead to the back for intermediate level bureaucrats and a clerks’ lounge. Each floor will have a water closet near the rear as well as a front one.

**Major **Guild **Hall A large reception desk will be between the two entry doors about nine feet into the interior. This front entrance area will be walled to make the space 27 feet wide and 19 feet deep. There will be a bench on either side of the entry room and in the far corners doors to offices (of 15’ x 19’ size) that occupy each front corner. One will be for a master member of the guild that certifies the credentials of persons seeking permits or employment situations. The other will be for a master member that issues permits and notices for guild members. There will be double doors behind the reception desk that lead out to a cross-hallway beyond, this passage also accessed by the corner offices. The double staircase will be where it is, steps to the basement beneath them,

###### Appendix A, Developing Yggsburgh

but there will be no wall separating if from the central interior, nor will there be enclosed hallways; the whole will be open space. In this space will be two small corner water closets, and a formal seating for members meeting on business, while at the back will be a restaurant and bar, the kitchen on the basement level where there is also storage and rooms for guild servants. On the first floor will be a front grand assembly hall, flanked by records storage rooms and staircases to the space above to the left and right of the central light well. 12-foot-wide passageways leading to the back of the hall will access the guild’s large chapel and its shrines, with small side rooms for vestments and altar service. On the top floor will be the offices of the guild master and his assistant, and apartments for master members in need of lodging space.

**Large Craftsman’s Shop** Replace the two door entries with a double gate of 12-foot width between their location, and put in a small side door about 12 feet to the side of the big entryway. This place might be where wheeled vehicles such as carts and wagons or carriages and coaches are built. It might be a cooperage making barrels, or a factory producing small watercraft. It might also serve as a wire-drawing factory or a metal foundry. In most cases, the very front of the building will be where finished examples of the

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

workmanship accomplished here are displayed. There will be a small office in one front corner near the small door in the front; this is the domain of the master craftsman and his secretary. The staircases will not be as shown, there be one off against a wall and on the opposite wall there will be ramp leading up. Under both will be like ways down to the basement. The remainder of the interior will be open except for posts supporting the floor above. Workmen will be scattered about at wall benches or laboring on partially completes products resting on the floor. The basement will be for raw materials storage. The upper floor for more of the same sort of work that is going on below. If there is a second floor or loft, this will be reached from street and back doors at one side or the other of the building, not opening into the main building area, rather accessing long flights of steps leading up, unless the apartments and rooms above are for shop workers only. If the upper space is rented out generally, then narrow the interior by three feet for 18 feet in front and in the rear. At the rear of the building will be a paved yard, this fenced or walled from the alley, with gates for entry of materials and exit of finished work.

**Other Uses** Bordello, hotel, paint manufactory; and these examples assume that no upper floors: fighting (boxing, wrestling, etc.) arena, distillery, foundry, opera house, playhouse, temple.


###### Smaller Buildings

There are three examples, each of which is detailed in succession.

**Little **Craftsman’s **or **Tradesman’s **Shop **(smallest) This is the sort of place a assay office, barber shop (baths in the rear), bowyer & fletcher, candle maker, cobbler, confectioner, crossbow maker, fortune teller, game shop, small gemner, herbalist, incense seller, inexpensive (mainly brass and copper) smith and jeweler, sign painter, messenger service, money changer, notary, low-class pawn shop, perfumer, potter, scribe, scriveners’ supply, small shrine, tattoo parlor, tobacconist, or woodcarver might have. Goods will line both walls, and likely narrow display tables line the center of the shop leaving narrow aisles to the rear sales counter.

1. Stairs to first floor dwelling quarters.
1. Stairway to basement storage and work area, this likely having a rear light well or two.
1. Sales/service counter.

The side-walled rear yard will be quite deep, 100 feet, and on the

###### Appendix A, Developing Yggsburgh



alley there might well be a small building of 15’ x 30’ or so size in which an even smaller tradesman has a shop and living quarters, or such a place might be a residence. If not, then there will be a wall and gate enclosing the lot.

**Average **Craftsman’s **or **Tradesman’s **Shop **(small) In this sort of shop a more prosperous craftsman, merchant, or tradesman might be found. Examples are antique dealer, architect’s office, armorer, baker, book seller, boot & shoe maker, butcher, button maker, carpenter, coffee house, cosmetics shop, cutler, dry goods merchant, eating house (restaurant), employment agency for day laborers and serving staff, fruitier, small general store, gift shop, glazier, gold smith, grocer, hairdresser, leather shop, limner (artist), men’s haberdasher, hatter, import goods merchant, large jeweler & gemner, lawyer, music store, typical pawn shop, poulterer, plumber, small printer, rat pit, religious objects dealer, saddler, second-hand goods shop, shrine, silver smith, spice dealer, fine tailor, small tavern, tea house, toy shop, upholsterer, small weaver, wine merchant.

Note interior divisions are examples only and can be freely altered. The front outside door accessing stairs up assumes the upper floor or floors are rented to other persons. If the building is owned by the shopkeeper, this feature might be altered to an inside front staircase

The side-walled rear yard will be 85 feet deep, and on the alley there might well be a small building of 30’ x 35’ or so size in which a small tradesman has a shop and living quarters, or such a place might be a residence. If not, then there will be a wall and gate enclosing the lot.

**Moderate **to **Large **Craftsman’s **or **Tradesman’s **Shop Here a moderately or very successful enterprise of a craftsman, merchant, or tradesman might be found. Examples are fine antiques dealer, art gallery, public bath, brewery, cabinet-maker’s shop, chapel, cock-fighting arena, dance hall, dancing academy, dog-fighting arena, draper, large eating house (restaurant), exporter, feed & grain merchant, felter, fencing school, small foundry (such as bronze), fuller, gaming house, normal guild hall, small gymnasium, mechanic’s shop, large importer, music theater, natatorium, rug dealer, large shrine, slater, slaughter house, tallow boiler, tannery, tavern, tiler, weaver, wheelwright, wire drawer.

#### General Types of Businesses

The Castle Keeper is encouraged to create various places in the Free Town of Yggsburgh. Some should be mundane, but the majority should be of at least passing interest to the characters


Chair service (near Link and Guard services)


Chandler (ship’s)

exploring the community. Most of them should be located in the lower and middle class areas, the better places in the latter blocks of the city, an architect’s office or an artistic painter. A common limner can be placed in the better lower class areas, while a tattoo parlor is strictly a lower-lower class establishment.

The format found in the main part of the module, in the section Various Other Notable Town Locations by Street, will serve as a guide. Simply recording the name of the place, and signs displayed, why the characters might want to visit it, the nature of the building and its business or businesses, its street location, the name of the principle persons or persons met there, their stats, and whatever process are applicable for goods or services will serve admirably—especially if you leave some extra room on your description sheet for added information. There is absolutely no need to have every building in the community identified. Nobody, not even a cab driver, knows that sort of detail.

The following tables provide numerous types of businesses located in Yggsburgh, which the Castle Keeper can and should use for development.

#### Typical Thorps

Thorps are little communities of freemen, generally farmers, with dwellings only, they being too small to support any commercial shop. Each has a less than a score of houses with barns and outbuildings, and an average population of 120 persons. A small shrine with a non-combatant low-level evil priest serving as spiritual “guide” for the folk of the thorp is the norm.

Each of the villages are located on a watercourse or else have a deep well. Each village consists of about 40 buildings and all have a religious structure, a large shrine or fane. The average population for these communities is 250-300 persons.

#### Typical Villages

The main part of the villages consists of two opposite rows of 16 stone cottages for the villains. Each row is separated into two parts so that eight families work a single section of the manor. There are separate and larger cottages for the reeve, cowherd, hayward, shepherd, swineherd, and woodward. One to two buildings of somewhat larger size are rented by freemen. One being an ale house or tavern while the other is a smith or general merchant. Each of the row houses has a tool shed and a garden behind it. Further back are four commonly used barns for large livestock and feed, as well as various wooden houses, sheds, and coups for farm equipment and smaller animals. At one end of the street between these structures is the village fane in which the town’s religious leader dwells and holds services. The grounds around the fane are lawn and gardens but of no great extent. Behind this is the local burial ground.

A thorp or village will have a shrine or chapel overseen by a cleric of low level (1st-3rd). A hamlet will have a fane with two clerics, one of moderate level (4th-6th) and an assistant of low level. all towns have multiple religious buildings--shrines, chapels (and chantries), fanes, temples, and likely a grand temple (similar to a cathedral.). The larger places will have a principle cleric of high level (7th or above), two or theee moderate level, and as many or

more low-level assistant clerics.

	* Assault of any officer of the law with or without a weapon by a commoner is punished as indicated, with maximum penalty likely given if the accused is found guilty and not a person of substance in the community. A noble is seldom accused of such act by any peace officer not of like status in the town. If the one accused of the assault is a noble or of gentle birth he is entitled to be tried by a judge, with or without a jury of his peers at the option of the accused. If insult to the honor of the accused was given by the one assaulted, the accused may demand trial by combat to settle the matter. Gentle persons not of martial sort may appoint a champion to represent them in the trial by combat.

***Any person of gentle birth can not be charged with such crime by one not of like status, or an officer of the town above the common ranks such as deputy sheriff and below.

Random Encounters Appendix

For purposes of this setting, the communities of free folk are classed as “thorps,” settlements of some 100 persons, and “hamlets,” communities of 200 or more persons, but under 1,000 (where “town” becomes proper name). The Castle Keeper can assume one craft or trade business for every 50 inhabitants over 100 persons in a community. So, a thorp of 150 persons might well have a blacksmith or an ale house, while a hamlet of 250 population would have both and perhaps a general store as well. The business fief does not include all of that, but the workers are employed at the whim of the vassal and he dispenses low justice to them, including life and death, and might have the power of taxation.


Appendix C, Urban Encounters

# Appendix C

## Urban Random Encounters and Events Tables

The following section contains all the random encounter tables useful for play in the urban areas of Yggsburgh. This appendix only contains the random encounter tables associated with the urban areas of Yggsburgh. Each encounter area in the adventure lists a chart to use for random encounters. Be sure to reference the correct encounter chart. Also, the encounter charts should be used as standards for other areas not detailed in the adventure but which the characters go to. Feel free to elaborate on any encounter.

A special encounter chart is used for the Outs Inn located at the end of this section. This encounter chart has a subchart detailing those encountered and possible adventure hooks for the characters. Further, the subtable can be used to develop random encounters anywhere within the setting in which the encounter is appropriate.

#### Random Encounters Non-Player Character

When assigning magic items to non-player characters be sure

that you don’t mind having those same items in the hands of characters. It is advised that you use care in this regard, limit usefulness through alignment, charges, and doses of potions.

**Agent **Party Several options for a party of agents are described below. These non-player characters have the best available armor and weapons and should be expanded or contracted as per the adventuring needs. The agent party should minimally consist of 3 agents with the balance being non-combatant servants. They will have a suite for the leader, a single room for the two other agents and beds in the dorm for the servants.The Agent Party should consist of a leader _(7th-10th _leeel _cleric _or _9th- _6th _wizard)_, 2-3 henchmen _(1-2 _3rd-9th _leeel _fighters _aud _a _5th-8th _leeel _thief)_ and retinue _(HD1d4 _humau _sereauts)_.

###### Adventure Hooks

There are four themes and plots that can be used if this encounter occurs. The list can be expanded upon and developed as desired.

**1:** The agents attempt to convince the characters to assassinate the town mayor or a counsel member. They claim to be in the service of a council member, noble or even the Lord Mayor. They are, in fact, not in the service of the one they claim but, are using the characters to perform some deed they would rather not be associated with them or their true master.

**2:** The agents attempt to enlist party to act as agents of a noble they do not represent and have them cause trouble in Yggsburgh— fights and killing, robbery and theft, mayhem and arson. They then denounce the characters and enable the authorities to capture them thus proving that their real master is a true friend of the town and only wants to protect all therein.

**3:** The agents seek assistance from the party in regards certain activities. This is usually piracy or highway robbery. They intend to introduce the party to this activity by involving them in it, perhaps explaining it away as righteous deeds. They do this so as to have the characters causing trouble in the area and disrupting the town government.

**4: If the characters seem of good nature and not scrupulous, the agents actually attempt to enlist the party as agents for their master. If successful, they have the party actively operate in all manner of destructive ways in the town and around it—arson, burglary, murder, piracy, rabble-rousing, robbery, etc. The party becomes the agents and act at the direction and sugestion of their new master.

**Arms & Armor Merchant with Stock** This retired warrior has become an arms and armor merchant. The merchant loves to talk shop and sells what he has in stock. He also agrees to purchase like weapons in good condition to replenish his stocks. He only offers half their value though. He is accompanied by two servants. He is staying in a single room while his servants are

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

located in the dorm room. This is a retired warrior _(10th-13th _leeel fighter) with two servants _(HD _1d4 _humau _sereauts)_.

###### Adventure Hook

This man knows of a distant cave in the hills (north or east) in which a band of dark dwarves dwell. These demi-humans are of a malign nature. It is rumored they hold and guard several magical weapons of benign which they can not use. The merchant guides the party to the cave complex of the dark dwarves if they desire to discover if this is true. However, he requires the party pledge to give him his choice of three swords they take from the evil demi- humans. Of course, only a few arms in the complex will be of the magical sort. Most are confer a +1 or so. Yet, there is one special and rare blade that the merchant gains and then departs with.

**Barbaric Hill Chief & Entourage A barbarian hill chief has arrived. The chief, his wife, advisor and loyal shieldmen are staying at the inn. Other than servants, the entire retinue are well armored and armed. The chief and chiefteness are staying in a suite, the advisor is staying in his or her own room while the shieldmen stay together in a large room. The servants are staying in the dormitory.

The retinue consists of a chief _(7th- 10th leeel chaotic ueutral_ _barbariau)_, chiefteness _(6th- _9th _leeel _chaotic _ueutral _barbariau)_, an advisor _(6th- 9th leeel chaotic ueutral druid with maiuly protectiou spells)_, 4 shieldmen _(4th- 6th leeel chaotic ueutral barbariau)_ with the remainder of the group being servants _(HD _1d4 _leeel _humau_ _sereauts)_.

###### Adventure Hook

This chieftain has been humiliated by a rival. He offers the party the “heroic opportunity to prove yourselves in battle,” by coming with him (to the north, east, or south) on a short (week-long) journey to his homeland. Here, the characters prove their mettle by joining his fight against vile foes (the rival hillmen). The outdoor adventure encounters aside, the combat thereafter is against foemen equal to the character’s level range not the chief’s level range.

**Coach Passengers** These are assorted travelers of an unremarkable sort such as businessmen, merchants and well-to- do craftsmen. Assume about half of the group will be two to a room. So, six passengers require three single rooms, five will fill four, and four will take three rooms.

###### Adventure Hook

The Castle Keeper must create more of these if the characters remain long at the inn and several passenger groups are met thus. An attractive passenger, likely a young woman, who has very rich parents asks that an able character accompany her on the next leg of the journey to Dunfalcon City or some other destination as she has received word that bandits intend to waylay the stage and kidnap her. Of course the whole party should go along, most aboard the coach, but some riding is okay. At the end of the day the bandits strike. The melee might involve the characters being captured and having to free themselves, then get their damsel in distress loose too and deal harshly with the kidnappers in the process. Of course her family will be appropriately ungrateful…


**Country **Squire **& **Family A squire _(ueutral _3rd-6th _leeel_ _fighter, _HP _5 _per _leeel)_, his wife and one or two young children, plus one to three servants are traveling through the area. The squire and his family are staying in a suite while the servants are staying in the dormitory or common room.

###### Adventure Hook

One of the squire’s sons _(ueutral, _2ud-5th _leeel _fighter, _HP _6 _per_ _leeel)_ goes into town and gets in trouble with a local gang of bullies. The squire vows to go and fight these ne’er-do-wells rather than ransom his son. He gladly pays the party to assist him in finding and trouncing the rascals, of course.

**Dwarven Chief & Entourage** This group consists of a dwarven chief _(lawful _ueutral, _7th-10th _leeel _fighter, _HP _8 _per _leeel)_, his steward _(lawful _ueutral, _5th-8th _leeel _fighter, _HP _8 _per _leeel)_, a jester _(lawful_ _ueutral,_ _3rd-5th/4th-6th_ _leeel_ _fighter/thief,_ _HP_ _5_ _per_ _leeel) and 4-9 warriors _(lawful _ueutral, _1st-3rd _leeel _fighter, _HP _7 _per_ _leeel)_. All have good armor and weapons. The lower level fighters are the servants. The chief, steward and jester all have their own room and the remainder are staying in a dormitory.

###### Adventure Hook

When at the inn, a weary dwarf runner comes panting up to tell his lord that orcs have invaded his glen and are threatening to break into the cavern stronghold of the clan. The chief of course calls upon all brave persons to join him in a rapid march back north to his territory. All those agreeing will be counted as dwarf friends and given badges to show that.

**Elven **Prince **& **Entourage An elven prince _(chaotic _good,_ _4th-5th/7th-10th leeel fighter/wizard, HP 5 per leeel, secoudary skill:_ _woodsmau)_, princess _(ueutral, 6th-9th leeel druid, HP 5 per leeel, secoudary_ _skill:_ _woodsmau)_, advisor _(chaotic_ _ueutral,_ _4th-5th/7th-_ _10th leeel fighter/thief, HP 4 per leeel, secoudary skill: woodsmau)_ and 4-7 warriors in support _(chaotic _good, _4th-7th _leeel _fighter, _HP _6 _per leeel, _secoudary _skill: _woodsmau) are staying here. They possess the best available armor and weapons. There are 1-10 servants with them also _(humau, _HD1d4 _sereauts)_. The prince, princess and advisor are staying in their own rooms, the warriors in oneor two rooms and the servants in the dormitory.

###### Adventure Hook

This haughty noble and his associates have no wish to deal with non-aristocrats, especially humans. If any of the character party, including those of elven race, should attempt to fraternize with them, they will treat them coldly. If persistent, the elven prince suggests a daring quest for the party and takes them with his party when they travel off on the East Highway. As a practical joke, the prince sees that their mead is drugged and then abandons the lot while they sleep. This will lead to at least one random encounter as the characters awaken from their stupor. See also Lone Mysterious Traveler below.

**Export Goods Merchant & Company (slaver)** A merchant _(ueutral _eeil _4th _- _10th _leeel _fighter, _HP _7 _per _leeel)_, his clerk _(ueutral eeil, 4th - 10th leeel wizard, HP 3 per leeel)_ and 3- 5 servants _(ueutral _eeil, _1st _-5th _leeel _fighters, _HP _6 _per _leeel) are

staying here. They have arms and armor hidden in their gear. The merchant and his scribe are staying in a room together while the rest are staying in the dormitory.

###### Adventure Hook

The “merchant” attempts to convince a gullible party to assist him in recovering a hijacked cargo of his goods. There is a small caravan of an actual merchant and teamsters accompanied by a band of average pilgrims heading off along the Dunfalcon Pike or Purple Tower Road the following day. The slaver’s objective is to have the party assist in capturing both goods and people that he will later sell to the west or southeast. After defeating the caravan the slaver will naturally want to dispose of the characters.…

**Horse **Trader **with **Herd A trader _(ueutral, _4th _- _7th _leeel_ _rauger, _HP _6 _per _leeel) and 2-5 herders _(2ud _- _5th _leeel _fighters, _HP_ _7 _per _leeel) are staying here. The lead trader is staying in a single roomwhile the others are in a dormitory.

###### Adventure Hook

This fellow has only excellent riding horses with him and if the party is seeking steeds for battle, he will happily enlist them in an enterprise he wishes to undertake, the roundup of a herd of hill ponies in the northeast. For every 10 of those he gains thus, he will supply to the party in return a trained warhorse of fine sort. Of course there will be wild hillmen to overcome, and actually trapping the main herd will take some planning and clever work. The Castle Keeper might add to this a streak of dishonesty, so that the horse trader attempts to pass off old and worthless nags in repayment.

**Knight **Errant **& **Entourage A knight _(lawful _good, _4th-7th_ _leeel _fighter, _HP _7 _per _leeel, _AC _19, _SA _str _17)_, his esquire _(lawful_ _good, 2ud-5th leeel fighter, HP 7 per leeel, AC 17, SA str 16)_ and 1-3 servants _(1st-3rd leeel fighter, HP 6 each, AC 15)_ are here. There is a single room for the knight and the esquire while the servants are lodged in the dormitory.

###### Adventure Hook

This aristocratic warrior is bent on righting wrongs and defeating evil wherever it is met. If approached with respect and given homage, the knight asks the party to join his band as his liegemen. If they agree, then the knight, you, the Castle Keeper, will lead the group on a tour of the area seeking monsters to fight and slay, bandits to defeat and arrest, all that sort of thing. This calls for considerable free-wheeling Castle Keeping, with periodic visits to Yggsburgh to bring in prisoners and to re-supply there, rest in the town or at the Outs Inn. Alternately, he can be posing as a knight errant but is in actuality here to kidnap and carry off the Lone Mysterious Traveler who is a Noble Lady Traveling Incognito (see below).

**Lone **Mysterious **Traveler An architect _(lawful _good, _2ud leeel _fighter, _HP _15) is staying here. He is in a single room.

###### Adventure Hook

This fellow is in the area seeking employment. He does not adventure, and thus there is little for the characters to gain in

###### Appendix C, Urban Encounters

regards to associating with him. However, if they are planning to build a place of any sort, or are seeking information on some local stronghold, the architect will be happy to be employed by them in designing or locating the plans of an existing construction. The latter service will cost from 50gp and up depending on the importance of the building and its owners/tenants. The Castle keeper might wish to supply the architect with a magic item appropriate to architectural work.

**Lone Mysterious Traveler An assassin _(lawful _eeil, _5th-8th_ _leeel _assassiu, _HP _5 _per _leeel, _carryiug _poisou _that _1d6+6 _poiut _of_ _damage) is staying here in a single room.

###### Adventure Hook

The Castle keeper must decide what target in the area the assassin has been contracted to kill. It might be an agent or some other person staying at the Outs Inn, or it could be someone important in town—the lord mayor or a counselor. Once that is decided upon, simply assume that the assassin befriends the party, deceives them as to his or her nature and purpose, attempts to use them as dupes and decoys so as to succeed in the mission and escape unscathed.

**Lone **Mysterious **Traveler A charlatan _(chaotic _ueutral, _5th-_ _8th leeel thief, SA 18, SK swiudliug, thespiau)_ is staying here alone in the room.

###### Adventure Hook

The Castle Keeper must again decide what swindle this pretender is attempting to use to defraud the characters or not. He or she might be offering spurious magical items for a high price, switching the actual ones for bogus duplicates at time of sale. He or she might be pretending to be an aristocrat of foreign sort, or a wealthy man of any occupation, hoping to have the party introduce him to likely marks for his thievery. He or she will have ample “proof” in forged documents, false seals, phony credentials. Of course, whatever is done, this character will be sure to implicate one or more of the PCs as the likely suspect for any crime he commits.

The Castle Keeper might wish to supply this nefarious person with a magic item appropriate to deceiving persons.

**Lone **Mysterious **Traveler A priest _(chaotic _ueutral, _2ud-9th_ _leeel cleric, HP 5 per leeel, AC 17, SA str 17)_ is staying here alone in a room.

###### Adventure Hook

This priest is on a quest to redeem himself for blasphemy. He must prove himself worthy of his chaotic deity or else get no higher- level spells again, essentially be defrocked. If the party is willing, he encourages them to join him in seeking to “do right” in this area, and particularly in Yggsburgh. This includes civil disobedience, rabble rousing, and the preaching of revolt against authority, the existing order to be replaced by a “Citizens Committee”—which he will head, of course, making his deity that honored in the town. Suggested name for such this priest is Jakmont and his Dedication being Jackmont the Equuitable.

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

**Lone Mysterious Traveler** A courtesan named Jylene Estralla _(ueutral _eeil, _3rd-6th _leeel _thief,SA _dex _18, _SK _subboruiug,_ _swiudliug) is staying here alone in a suite.

###### Adventure Hook

This individual is aged 30 but still very attractive and has strong charisma. She was the leman of one of the powerful nobles in the vicinity—Lyle Baron Redfort, Bertram Count Easmoor. or Edgar Marquis Talworth—according to the Castle Keeper’s plot. She has been replaced by a younger and prettier mistress, managed to escape here with a considerable sum in jewelry and coin before her former patron could seize her wealth and have her locked away. She is traveling under a false name such as Madam Marguerite of Devers or Lady Anne Durnst. She wants protection from her former master, of course, or against an assassin sent to kill her and bring back the “stolen” wealth. Naturally, she attempts to gain such aid without cash outlay, and to the contrary will seen to gain more money from cahracters that befriend her. Her ultimate plan is to take a coach or riverboat from here to Dunfalcon, but she fears such means of conveyance are watched, and she will be caught. The Castle Keeper might wish to supply her with a magic item appropriate to her seductions.

**Lone **Mysterious **Traveler Vertimas Attwood _(ueutral, _3rd_

_- 6th leeel druid, HP 6 per leeel, PA wis, str, cha, SA str15)_ is staying in a single room.

###### Adventure Hook

This nature priest is seeking Hiddendale. In it, there is a cairn surrounded by a ring of menhirs (standing stones) and was once an ancient and once sacred place now defiled by a monster that dwells within the mound of piled-up rocks. He gladly accepts the party’s assistance in finding the location and fighting the monster. If this succeeds, the druid cleanses the place and makes it back into a sacred one, using an ancient and most potent gold torque found in the monster’s hoard of treasure to accomplish this.

For their help, he gives the party 10 large cairngorms each. These golden-gray quartz gems worth 500gp apiece. He also gives the party equal shares of any other treasure found.

**The **Gold **Torque: This increases all stats by 1 point when worn.The wearer is able to know and cast daily three 1st level, two 2nd level, and 1 3rd level druid spell. It also adds one level to any druid character wearing it. If worn by a non-druid, this artifact causes the individual to become increasingly introverted, desiring the solitude of the wilderness, and communing with nature. The end result if not given away will be that the possessor becomes a hermit dwelling in some wild and lonely woodland.

**Lone **Mysterious **Traveler An engineer _(lawful _good, _4th_ _leeel _fighter, _HP _24, _PA _str, _iut, _wis, _SK _coustructiou) is staying in a single room.

###### Adventure Hook

This fellow is in the area seeking employment. He does not adventure, and thus there is little for the characters to gain in regards to associating with him. However, if they are planning


to build anything of mechanical sort, or need information of engineering-related topics, he will be happy to be employed by them in such regard. Any of the latter services will cost from 25gp and up, depending on the details of the construction or recondite nature of the information sought. For example, he might be able to discover and furnish the team with plans of the sewer system of Yggsburgh, this taking several days and no less than 100gp for his efforts. He might also design a folding hand crossbow with added power in its arms, thus giving it a non-magical bonus of

+1 damage, for a fee of at least 1250gp. The castle Keeper might wish to supply this character with a magic item appropriate to his engineering work.

**Lone **Mysterious **Traveler An Explorer _(ueutral _good, _7th_ _leeel _rauger, _HP _38, _SA _dex 16) is staying in a single room.

###### Adventure Hook

This fellow is in the area planning to explore the northern region and discover any noteworthy places there, come back to Yggsburgh and see if the lord mayor will reward him for detailed maps and information pertaining to the area. He does not have any interest in dungeon delving, nor does he desire to become engaged in dangerous warfare save that necessary for the common good. Otherwise, he is not averse to having the team of adventurers join him on his survey of the wild lands to the north. If the engineer is included in the group going with the druid above, he remains with that individual as a follower and henchman-guard. The Castle Keeper might wish to supply this person with a magic item appropriate to exploration.

**Lone Mysterious Traveler** This warrior (chaotic neutral, 5th-8th level fighter, HP 7 per level, SA dex 17, EQ leather armor, long sword, dagger, and crossbow) is staying in a single room.

###### Adventure Hook

Spending the last of his funds to stay at the inn, this man is concerned about finding mercenary employment or any sort. The courtesan might enlist his services for a time if there is an agent of her former master at the inn. Otherwise if there are agents or any others in the establishment who will employ him, he quickly accepts such service. Failing that, the party can hire his services for any reason provided they pay well—up front cash and am equal share of any loot taken. If they have no plan in mind, this fellow suggests seeking out river pirates or like robbers to waylay and rob from, the reward from such a good deed being the plunder taken from the thieves…

**Lone **Mysterious **Traveler This is a Financier _(HD _1d6, _HP_ _5, _SS _busiuess) is staying in a single room.

###### Adventure Hook

The financier is traveling incognito on his way to Dunfalcon City. He professes to be a scholar if questioned. He is nervous because he fears someone has learned that he is carrying negotiable letters of credit totaling 500.000gp. If the team is clearly of good and honest members, he asks them to serve as an escort on a swift ship heading done the River Nemo to the city, three days travel distant downstream, twice that time coming back by water, four days by coach ride.

For their assistance he pays all reasonable expenses and a fee of250gp to each character guarding him. The Caste Keeper might well want to have other guests at the inn know about him and the vast sum of money he represents, and develop a scenario regarding robbery and murder, theft, or kidnaping. The Castle Keeper might wish to supply this person with a magic item appropriate to his protection from kidnappers or thieves.

**Lone Mysterious Traveler** This gambler, Ponce Fylez (neutral evil, 5th-9th level thief, HP 5 per level, SA dex 18, SS swindling, thespian) is staying in a single room.

###### Adventure Hook

Feigning to be a well-to-do gentleman, the younger son of foreign nobleman, this handsome and dashing man of around 30 years of age is most skilled at manual dexterity (+10 in any such check, including picking locks). Of course he is a clever cheat at cards and dice games, losing much of the time but winning most of the really big stakes. In any gambling he gets a +18 to his check at his choosing.

A courtesan is likely to hook up with him, to work some confidence scheme, perhaps involving the financier and the character party. This fellow will certainly be able to fleece the local bravos, beat them at their own game, and in so doing might well rope the team of characters into seeming to be his associates. The Castle Keeper might wish to supply Ponce with a magic item appropriate to his gambling—a means of cheating or adding to luck.

**Lone **Mysterious **Traveler This is a gem dealer _(HD _1d6,_ _HP _5, _SS _busiuess) who is staying in a single room.

###### Adventure Hook

This modestly dressed individual is interested in hearing tales of adventure told by the characters and tells them he is looking for a nice gemstone to buy from his wife back home, a cairngorm or two. He will pay 10% (60% of trade value) more then the local banker for good stones, as he is also a jeweler.

Of course he had a supply of gemstones hidden in a false bottom of his portmanteau, diamonds, corundum stones, alexandrites, beryls including green ones, and precious opals. These are worth 20,000gp in trade value, and so the Castle Keeper might want to use the gem dealer for a scenario regarding robbery and murder, theft, or kidnapping. Also, if he is nervous, he might want to hire the team as bodyguards when he goes into Yggsburgh to dispose of his wares. The Castle Keeper might wish to supply the gem dealer with a magic item appropriate to his protection from kidnappers or thieves.

**Lone **Mysterious **Traveler Adelaide Heath _(HD _1d6, _HP _5)_

is an heiress staying in a single room.

###### Adventure Hook

This middle-aged woman, a very wealthy heiress, is rather plain and on the plump side, but she is bound and determined to find a new husband. She is staying at the inn to see if some eligible patron

of proper standing might be discovered here, and to attract such a man she often wears valuable jewelry and spends gold freely. If not, she plans to move her lodgings to a good hotel in Yggsburgh and hunt further therein. She will be met in the lounge, and being garrulous and outgoing speak with characters that appear to be of at least middle class. If male, she will flirt. If female she will confide that she is seeking a good husband, and that she has a large country estate about 10 days travel time northeast along the river high road, and her new husband will be lord of the manor and several thousand acres of land.

Enterprising characters might attempt to play match-maker, for Adelaide will confide that she would gift to anyone 500gp for an introduction to the right man who would marry her. Of course introducing her to the wrong sort will result in all manner of trouble, including being charged as accomplices in theft, and at least being disparaged vocally and gaining a bad reputation at the inn, possibly being asked to leave. The Castle Keeper might wish to supply Adelaide with a magic item appropriate to her protection from kidnappers or thieves.

**Lone **Mysterious **Traveler Rilanzia of Thantos the mage

_(chaotoc _good, _6th _- _9th _leeel _wizard, _HP _4 _per _leeel, _SA _dex 16, _EQ_

_+3 _riug _of _protectiou) is staying in a single room.

###### Adventure Hook

An unlucky sort of spell caster, this fellow is seeking employment somewhere. So far he has been unable to find a position he likes, for he is not of adventurous nature and dislikes violence. He can and will use magic to defend himself, but he would rather be in a comfortable position where he can use his spells for more positive purposes. He has not thought to inquire at the Yggsburgh College, and there he can find a teaching position, for he knows many non-combat related spells of the sort for business and commercial application. Should the characters be able to introduce him to the president or dean of that college, he will be indebted and thereafter supply up to four needed spells of up to 4th level to any magic-using character in the group whenever they call upon him at his new position. Of course, an inventive character might be able to find some desirable position for this fellow with one of the inn’s guests. In such case he will also be indebted, and give over a scroll with one spell each of 1st through 3rd level to the party. The Castle Keeper might should supply him with a magic item appropriate to his class, and also detail spell books in his possession.

**Lone Mysterious Traveler This Mercenary Captain Sandor Del Lago _(lawful ueutral, 9th-12th leeel fighter, HP 5 per leeel, AC_ _22)_ is staying in a single room.

###### Adventure Hook

This man is seeking officers and non-commissioned officer recruits for a new company he is raising. He is doing so because Marquis Talworth has offered him employment if he comes with no fewer than 40 mounted serjeants, 40 archers, and 120 men-at-arms. Captain Del Lago is being most cautious, of course, testing the local opinion of the rule of the lord mayor of Yggsburgh. If he can recruit men from here he feels that this will make his force more valuable–his troops knowing the area and the town. His recruiting

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

pitch is based on good pay and brave fighting, with plenty of loot to be had in victory. Base pay offered is 15gp per day and triple shares for lieutenants and like officers and 10gp and double shares for non-commissioned officers.

**Lone **Mysterious Traveler** This is a Noble Lady incognito

_(HD _1d6, _HP _5) who is staying in a single room.

###### Adventure Hooks

This woman can be whatever the CastleKeeper desires, young to elderly or beautiful to homely. She has a considerable store of coin and jewelry in her possession to finance her flight. Here are several suggestions:

**1:** She is the rebellious daughter of one of the three nobles contending to seize and rule Yggsburgh, she being opposed to her father’s aggression and seeking someone to whom she can entrust information regarding his planned invasion.

**2:** The woman if feigning to be opposed to her father’s plans, but in reality she is seeking to further them, pretending to be the daughter of one of her father’s rivals.

**3:** The woman is betrothed to one of the three nobles, but she hates him, is here seeking a way to avoid marrying the noble, for her father has sent forth minions to find and forcibly take her off to be married.

See also Knight Errant & Entourage. The Castle Keeper might wish to supply this lady with a magic item appropriate to her protection from kidnappers or thieves.

**Lone **Mysterious **Traveler This noble person _(lawful _good,_ _6th-9th _leeel _paladiu, _HP _8 _per _leeel, _AC _21, _SA _str _17, _dex _16, _EQ_

_+5 _lougsword, _medium _war _horse) is staying in a single room.

###### Adventure Hook

What else but a noble quest is suited to a paladin? The Castle Keeper might want to have that quest one against a ravening band of humanoids in the forested hills to the north, in which case he will gladly accept the party as liegemen if they are willing to go on such an adventure. Perhaps, though, this chivalrous fellow is at the inn to find and bring back to her husband-to-be the Noble Lady traveling alone and incognito mentioned above. For a marriage contract is lawful, and her father has the right to bind his daughter to marriage thus.

If the paladin is with the party when it meets the Elven Prince & Entourage (above), assume that the elves will accept the lot and enlist them for a foray against woodland humanoids, reaving ogres perhaps.

**Lone **Mysterious **Traveler This traveler _(ueutral _good, _5th-_ _8th _leeel _rauger, _HP _8 _per _leeel, _SA _str _15, _dex _18, _EQ _+3 _leather_ _armor, _+2 _lougsword, _+2 _lougbow, _20x _+1 _arrows) is staying in a single room.


###### Adventure Hook

This character is suitable for any properly justified activity. He can be assumed to know the wooded areas to the east and north, or at least knows of any despoilers therein. He can also be assumed to be willing to join in an adventuring band that is aiming to right a wrong. If the ranger is with the party when it meets the Elven Prince & Entourage (above), assume that the elves accept the lot and enlist them for a foray against woodland humanoids, reaving bugbears perhaps.

**Lone **Mysterious **Traveler This sage, Theophilis Hermetios

_(HD _1d6, _HP _5_) is staying in a single room. .

###### Adventure Hook

Theophilis Hermetios is an elderly fellow that is obviously keen of wit and of upper middle class. As a gentleman and a scholar, this character will be polite, but he is likely to be both rather aloof and impatient with ignorant adventurers that bother him without proper introduction. He can give advice and information—for a fee, gratis to friends who have done him a favor, less than desirable in result of the characters have been rude and annoyed him. If there is one or more agents of the nobles contending for possession of Yggsburg present when the sage is at the inn, he will ascertain their nature. This information can be used by the party if they are on the right side of the fellow, and if they take him to the lord mayor, that worthy will listen to the sage, hire him as assistant, and both mayor and sage will be friendly to the party, important connections thereafter. The Castle Keeper might wish to supply Theophilis with a magic item appropriate to his profession.

**Lone **Mysterious **Traveler Wavil Prestard, an alias (_ueutral_ _eeil, 5th-10th leeel thief, SA str 14, dex 18, EQ +1 leather armor, +1_ _riug _of _protectiou, _+1 _lougsword)_, is staying in a single room.

###### Adventure Hook

A successful robber and swindler as well as a jewel thief by preference, this fellow is looking for a mark at the inn. He will be friendly with the characters, and if he can learn about any of the other patrons from them (especially the courtesan, financier, gem dealer, heiress, and/or noble lady) he will buy drinks and pump them for all that can be had. He spots the gambler and the bravos and tells the party about them if it will further his ends. The main scenario is that of jewel theft, of course, with Wavil disappearing and suspicion being on the party with whom he was seen rubbing elbows. The characters must then chase him down and recover the loot from him, even bring him back to stand trial so as to completely exonerate themselves.

**Lone **Mysterious **Traveler Perry Springhill _(eampre, _HD_ _8d12, _HP _50, _AC _20)_, an alias, is traveling incognito. He is staying in a villa.

###### Adventure Hook

Claiming to be the rightful heir to the throne of a noble that has been dispossessed by an usurping uncle, this vampire uses that as an excuse not to be abroad in sunlight. If asked by a party member,

he claims fear of being recognized by an assassin. While at the inn, the vampire feeds, attacking female guests in preference to males—especially the courtesan, heiress, and/or noble lady. Although, a lone female coach or riverboat passengers, or even a serving maid of the staff are fair prey to him. The Castle Keeper should make a point of having the characters note a victim before being slain if that is practical. Otherwise, one character should be “visited” by the newly arisen vampire (lesser vampire, HD 6d12, HP 30, AC 18), be attacked, and then the hunt should be on. The Lone Mysterious Traveler a cleric) will readily join the party in such an enterprise, as will the like Paladin.

**Mine **Owner **& **Party A mine owner _(lawful _ueutral, _3rd _leeel_ _fighter, _HP _17, _AC _13, _EQ _leather _armor, _short _sword, _dagger) and his foreman _(lawful _ueutral, _2ud _leeel _fighter, _HP _12, _AC _13, _leather_ _armor, _short _sword, _dagger) are staying in two single rooms.

###### Adventure Hook

Coming in from the Glittering Knobs, this wealthy mine owner has brought with him gold ore and uncut gem crystals. He means to take them into Yggsburgh to sell them but, he has been warned that he and his party will be waylaid along the way, even in the town. He is thus quietly seeking an armed escort.

There is a plot to kill him. A gang of six bullies _(chaotic _eeil, _3rd_ _leeel _fighters, _HP _15, _AC _13, _EQ _leather _armor, _clubs _aud _dagger) are ready to ambush him when they receive word. Word will come via Jason Barger (see above) who will send a homing pigeon to alert the gang. After the mine owner is slain, Jason plans to take over the diggings, use the proceeds to feather his nest as well as pay for subversive activities in town that further his ends. If the party is friendly and polite, he will hire them to accompany his group into town, paying them 12gp apiece for the morning’s work.

**Renown **Artist **and **Sculptor This person is a sculptor and artist _(HD _1d6, _HP _5) and is staying in a single room.

###### Adventure Hook

Such an person is not going to adventure or even provide much in the line of action. Roleplay is the main activity in which to involve characters in regards to this guest. If the characters have become wealthy and relatively famous for their deeds, the fellow suggests that the group, or its most prominent member, commission him to do a portrait or portraits, or possibly sculpt a statue or statue group.

The cost is12gp per day while working on the project (10 days per painting, 30 days per statue) plus the artist’s fee when the work is complete. This is an additional 370gp per painting and 1250gp per statue. Incidentally, the material for statues is at the expense of the one commissioning it. This means an additional 125gp for a suitable marble block delivered to the inn, 750gp for bronze and it’s casting at a foundry in Yggsburgh and then removal to the site it is to be placed in and it’s erection. The Castle Keeper might wish to supply this artist with a magic item appropriate to his profession.

###### Appendix C, Urban Encounters

The Outs Inn proudly hosts the sculpting process at no cost if the statue is to be erected on their property and become part of the inn.Otherwise they will charge for studio space in a 20gp per month store room.

**Renown Author and Poet** This encounter is with a single person _(HD _1d6, _HP _5) who is staying in a single room.

###### Adventure Hook

Such a person is not going to adventure or even provide much in the line of action. Roleplay is the main activity in which to involve characters in regards to this guest. He listens to stories of the party’s adventures, especially if they are providing him with food and drink. He express interest in their deeds and suggest that an epic poem to immortalize their exploits might be written if they are willing to assist him—merely see to his lodging and found while he composes the work. That requires at least two weeks, and he stretches it as much as the traffic will bear. His keep sets the party back 100gp per week, but he delivers an epic poem that gives the party considerable local renown and of a minor sort away from.

If an epic poem is composed, the author surely mentions the inn and its owner, thus gain an additional two weeks stay there gratis. While engaged in penning the heroic saga, this fellow will also outline a dramatic tale based loosely on the adventures of the party, the events and names altered so as to be quite different from the contents of the poem. He completes and sell the work as a play and a book in Yggsburgh and become a local celebrity with an assured income for his lifetime. He will not be particularly grateful to the characters but, will gladly allow them to make him their guest, and listen to more of their adventure accounts… The Castle Keeper might wish to supply this non-player character with a magic item appropriate to his profession.

**Renowned **Musician A renowned musician _(HD _1d6, _HP _6)_

is staying herein a single room

###### Adventure Hook

The musician will not be going to adventure or even provide much in the line of action for the characters. Roleplay is the main activity in which to involve characters in regards to this guest. He is a guest at the same time the poet is (see above) and is not be on friendly terms with that author. In all events, if the characters become known to him, he suggests that their deeds be made famous in song, and that he can compose and sing a ballad extolling their exploits so as to give them their proper fame. If the party is agreeable, the musician spends a week’s time completing his bardic work and the party will have a reckoning of 250gp, half of which is the fee for the composition, the remainder his upkeep during the time he was creating it. His ballad brings renown as noted above for the epic poem. The effect will be improved upon for each additional week, up to three, the party allows him to spend developing the composition and lyrics.

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

If a ballad is thus commissioned the musician includes stanzas regarding the inn and be treated as if the poet would be to a two week stay “on the house.” He will then remove to Yggsburgh and perform there for a month or more, his repertoire featuring the party in the ballad. That will mean they are recognized in the town, with all of what goes with that. The Castle Keeper might wish to supply this NPC with a magic item appropriate to his profession such as a musical instrument.

**Rich, Exotic Aristocrat & Entourage** Here the Castle Keeper is left to his own creative devices. This party of 7-12 individuals is likely from some distant place akin to our own Persia, China or Japan, or possibly an American Indian-like group such as Aztecs or Incas. The composition of such a group will certainly have potent characters of fighter, cleric, and wizard classes. To get so far distant from their homeland they must be very able and tough.

###### Adventure Hook

Where the group is from and why they are in the area are the keys to determining what sort of adventure possibilities, they might provide for the characters. Perhaps the exotic travelers are seeking a sacrificial victim of unusual sort, or their being here might be more prosaic, sightseeing and gathering knowledge. Whatever suits the nature of the group as the Castle Keeper as devised it will provide suggestions for involving the party with them.

**Rich Foreign Aristocrat & Entourage (actually Bandit Highwaymen)** The “Lord” and leader of this band _(ueutral _4th-7th _leeel _fighter, _HP _8 _per _leeel, _AC _19, _SA _str _17, _SK thespiau)_, his chamberlain _(ueutral 3rd-6th leeel wizard, HP 4 per_ _leeel, _AC _13, _SA _dex)_, his herald _(ueutral _3rd-6th _leeel _thief, _HP_ _4perleeel, _AC _13, _SA _dex _18) and 2-5 servants _(2ud-4th _leeel _fighter,_ _HP 6 per leeel, AC 17)_ are staying here. They have two single rooms and a dormitory for the others.

###### Adventure Hook

More opportunity for roleplay here and the options abound! This party is seeking a rich prize, so many of the inn’s guests are of interest to them, including the agent parties as well as the exotic aristocrats and the other foreign ones (vampires). The Castle Keeper can assume this group is outgoing and sociable so as to learn as much as possible. They gladly interact with the party and consider them as potential marks if they are flashing wealth and seem relatively vulnerable. On the other hand, if the characters seem very able, the highwaymen either give them a wide berth or attempt to enlist them in a grand robbery scheme, planning to double-cross them, of course, so as to keep the swag for themselves. Alternately, this band of thieves might be clandestine supporters of the local government because it is lax in protecting the roads, or they might be like partisans of one of the nobles who scheme to conquer Yggsburgh and make it a province of their own domain.

**Rich Foreign Aristocrat & Entourage (Vampires)** Waldgraf Gruen is the current alias of this vampire _(HD _8d12, _HP_ _48, _AC _20), _the _lady _Grueu _(lesser _eampire, _HD _6d12, _HP _36, _AC_ _18)_, Gregor the Chaplin _(chaotic _eeil, _6th _leeel _cleric, _HP _30, _AC_


_13, Str 15, medalliou of aligumeut reeersal)_ and 2-5 servants _(chaotic_ _eeil, _2ud _leeel _fighter, _HP _12, _AC _13) are staying here. They have rented two villas. Waldgraf Gruen and Lady Gruen are in one and the remainder are in the other.

###### Adventure Hook

This blood-sucker claims a mysterious illness that makes him sensitive to light, especially full sunlight that keeps him indoors during full daylight. That is why the cleric is always nearby so as to be ready to use magic to keep his lord from fainting. Their story is that they are staying at Outs Inn to rest before going on the Dunfalcon to seek a cure there. The two vampires will not take any victims from the inn and leave as bats late at night to scour the area around for such feeding. This local vampiric killings quickly become the talk of the inn and, if a vampire is present there, the “chaplain” will, at his master’s behest, point a character out for being a vampire. That will not stop the killings, and the party will be suspect and need to find out who is the culprit or else!

**Riverboat Travelers As with coach passengers, this is a group of assorted travelers of unremarkable sort such as businessmen, merchants and well-to-do craftsmen. The leaers are staying in a single room, the others require three to five single rooms and about half the remainder of the group lodged in dormitory accommodations.

###### Adventure Hook

The Castle Keeper must create more of these if the party remains long at the inn and several passenger groups are met thus. An adventurous passenger, likely a young man, who has a treasure map in his possession will ask the party to accompany him on a side excursion, so as to find and loot a long-lost treasure trove. The location should be near the Nemo or Urt Rivers an is best managed as a portal taking the party far distance, or else a cave leading to a subterranean place, or both in combination.

**Ship Owner Captain Captain Ivar Hannes _(lawful _ueutral,_ _7th _leeel _fighter _HP _49, _SA _, _str _16 _aud _dex _16,SK _busiuess, _uautical)_ is staying in a single room here.

###### Adventure Hook

This mariner is returning from a river cruise up the River Nemo, a sort of busman’s holiday. Now on his way back downstream to Dunfalcon City with his ship the Silver Wind, the captain is enjoying a last bit of recreation before getting back to his trading on the vast inland that he plies. So he is drinking and gambling and a perfect mark for the card sharps that frequent the inn. If the party takes his side in a dispute over cheating, Captain Hannes offers them berths as marines on his ship, for the waters he sails are plagued with pirates. Should the team accept, they will be off downriver and a week later out on the open waters of the sea-like body of fresh water on whose shores Dunfalcon City stands. On a trading cruise that lasts from 4-6 weeks the characters certainly encounter at least one sea monster and a gang of pirates also. If successful in overcoming those adversaries, they come back to land with some mariner’s skills and 500gp each plus any loot captured from the corsairs they met and bested. The Castle Keeper might wish to supply this character with a magic item appropriate to his profession.

The Castle Keeper must devise a reason for them to return to the Outs Inn if the party did not leave mounts and excess baggage there. One suggestion is that Innkeeper Gunderson has left a message for them at the warehouse where Captain Hannes leaves his cargo. This note is a plea for them to return to the inn in order to help in solving a mystery or a murder or to prevent further murders.

**Successful Traders Company Three traders _(2ud leeel_ _fighter, HP 10, AC 13, SS busiuess, EQ leather armor, short sword_ _aud _dagger) and 2-5 servants _(HD _1d6, _HP _4) are staying in three single rooms with the servants in the dormitory.

###### Adventure Hook

These men note and seek to hire the adventurer team to serve as special guards for their planned excursion into the northeastern Menhir hills. They intend to follow the Quarry Track past the place where stone is taken, for they have intelligence that further along there is a thriving village of hunters and trappers with a great store of pelts and hides just waiting the trader who comes with goods to swap for them.

Of course there will be plenty of encounters along the way, and the village in which the furs are to be gains is peopled with rather savage folk. A successful expedition, though should gain each character with 500gp in coin as pay from the traders when they return to the Out’s Inn.

**Touring Noble & Entourage This noble _(lawful _ueutral,_ _5th-7th leeel fighter, HP 7per leeel, AC 18)_, his guard _(lawful good_ _5th _leeel _fighter, _HP _35, _AC _18)_, his lady and madam, four servants, two men and two maids _(all _HD _1d4) are staying here. The noble and his lady are staying in a suite, the guard and four servants are in one room while the remainder are in the dormitory.

###### Adventure Hook

Perhaps this apparently rather foppish group came to the inn via their own coach, the two noblemen riding their steeds, in which case there will be a coachman staying too. While seemingly just enjoying an outing, the noble might well be spying out the area, carrying secret communications for the lord mayor. Not wanting to reveal that, the noble would then engage the party to deliver a special gift to the master of Yggsburgh, paying each person in the group 50gp for their trouble. If the gift contains a secret communication, the cabal of counsel members will attempt to have their bully-boy minions intercept the characters. On the other hand, the gift could be a deadly sort of magical or mechanical trap meant to kill the lord mayor. In the latter case the noble group will be departing the Outs Inn abruptly, with the knight remaining behind to get word of success or failure before spurring on to catch up with the others in the group.

**Troupe **of **Famous **Performers This company of actors is composed of twelve actors and performers _(HD _1d6, _HP _eariable,_ _SS thespiau)_. The leader of the group _(4th-6th/5th-7th leeel,_ _illusiouist/thief, _HP _4 _per _leeel, _SA _dex _18, _SK _swiudliug, _thespiau)_ is staying in a suite or villa while his compatriots are staying in smaller suites or the dormitory.

###### Appendix C, Urban Encounters

###### Adventure Hook

The troupe has stopped at the inn to rest a few days before appearing in Yggsburgh to perform for the lord mayor, counsel, and other important persons of the town. Thereafter, they perform in the Outs Playhouse for as long as they fill the house, then travel on down the Nemo to see about an engagement in Dunfalcon. While at the inn they perform amusing skits, songs, and minstrel entertainments in the lounge and thus get free meals and drinks. As actors, the members are 50% likely to be able to spot inn patrons using deception and pretending to be something other than what they are. If the party becomes friendly with the troupe, slips coins to one or more members, the performer(s) mention their observations regarding posing guests to the adventurers, thus giving them solid clues. Of course, some of the assumptions made by the actors will not be correct… The Castle Keeper might wish to supply the leader with a magic item appropriate to the trade of the group, likely it belonging to the head of the company.

**Wealthy **Merchant **Group Four merchants _(lawful _ueutral,_ _HD 1d6, HP 5, SK busiuess)_, each with a servant _(3rd leeel fighter, HP 16, AC 13, dagger aud spetum, SK busiuess)_ are staying here. The merchants are in single rooms and the servants are in the dormitory.

###### Adventure Hook

Highway robbery! hat’s what this group will be complaining loudly about, for they were held up on their way here by bandits (afoot or mounted). If the characters inquire, the merchants offer a reward for the capture of at least one of the robbers (the rest preferably dead) and the return of the personal property and letters of credit stolen from them. The reward is 2,500gp as the letters of credit are worth several millions. If you supply the bandit group with some other loot and any magic items, this scenario could be a great coup for surviving party members.

**Well-to-do **Pilgrim **Band This group of pilgrims consist of a priest _(ueutral _good, _3rd _- _6th _leeel _cleric, _HP _5 _per _leeel)_, two assistant priests _(ueutral _good, _1st _- _2ud _leeel _cleric, _HP _5 _per _leeel)_ and a provost _(ueutral good, 4th - 7th leeel rauger, HP 6 per leeel)_ and 5-12 pilgrims _(HD _1d4, _humau _sereauts)_. The four principal pilgrims are guests of the priest in the chapel within the inn complex. The others in the party take dormitory bed lodgings All eat in the servant’s refectory, save for one night when they have a celebratory banquet at which the local cleric is a guest of honor.

###### Adventure Hook

The chief cleric of the pilgrims urges the characters to join his group on its pilgrimage to a holy site in the mountains far to the west. Of course the new pilgrims would be expected to protect the party and share wealth with it as needed for its welfare. If this suggestion is followed up on by the players, move the campaign to the outdoor map of your campaign world and have them commence a trek to a distant mountainous region in the west, setting this module aside until the characters complete their journey and decide to return to the Yggsburgh locale.

Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

# Appendix D

## Yggsburgh Environs

Random Encounter and Event Tables

The following section contains all the random encounter tables useful for play in the environs of Yggsburgh. The random encounters occurring in Yggsburg or other urban settings is detailed in the Yggsburgh and Urban Random Encounters appendix. This appendix only contains the random encounter tables associated with the environs of Yggsburgh. These are mostly wilderness or road encounters.

To determine if there is an encounter, first reference the type of terrain the characters are traveling through. Roads and tracks take precedence over the geographic tables. For example, if the party is traveling along a major road in an area of wooded hills, use the Main Road encounter table and not the Wooded Hills Encounter Table. The type of terrain the party is traveling through is usually self-evident or listed in the Geographic Description

On each table is an associated “Encounter Frequency” (EF) and “Encounter Determination” (ED) category. The Encounter Frequency lists the number of times a random encounter check should be made, when those encounters occur and the die type used to determine if an encounter occurs. The Encounter Determination lists the results of the die roll and what chart, if


any, to reference to determine the encounter type. In general, if an encounter occurs, the roll of a d100 determines what type of encounter it is.

Within the parenthesizes following the encounter type are the number of creatures encountered and other important information, if any. Additionally, should other tables need referencing to further determine the nature of the encountered, they too are listed.

If an encounter occurs, there are many sub-tables detailing the nature, activities and conditions of those encounters. For example, when humanoids are encountered, there is a humanoid encounter table that must be referenced to determine what type humanoid is. Further, there are tables detailing the condition and disposition of those encountered. If an animal or monster is encountered, refer to the Random Animal or Monster Physical Condition Table to determine what condition it is in. And, if one or a pair of monsters is indicated, refer to the Random Monster or Activity Table on ). Remember, common sense must prevail in these occasions as the encounters are too varied for too exacting an application or explication.

#### Activities and Conditions

Random land encounters, animals or monsters are usually doing something other than wandering around looking for characters to kill (though this is not always the case). After determining what kind of monster or animal is encountered, consult both of the following sub-tables to discover the activity and condition of the creature encountered by rolling a d100 once on each table. Apply these tables only when a single monster or pair is encountered, not to groups of 3 or more. Ignore results incompatible with a monster of the sort indicated.

###### Local Domestic Animals

The following information is supplied for those Castle Keepers that desire a bit of “difference” in otherwise familiar things such as livestock seen—riding horses, dogs, farm animals. A casual mention of something different from the normal seen in our world adds to the fantasy nature of the setting while increasing verisimilitude for those concerned with the mundane.

**Dogs** Most dogs encountered will be mixed breed of moderate size. The following examples are given for a description base for other sorts kept for various reasons: Belgian Shepard (draft, guard, herding), Border Collie (herding), Greater Swiss Mountain Dog (draft, herding), Irish Wolfhound (guarding and hunting), Mastiff (guarding, hunting, and war), Norwegian Elkhound (guarding and hunting), and whatever sorts of hunting dogs you care to include—hounds, pointers, setters, spaniels, terriers.

**Horses** The GM can refer to known breeds in describing horses, especially war horses. The destrier is akin to a Shire horse, the charger is similar to a Percheron, and a courser can be likened to a Morgan or a Saddlebred horse. Coloration described should be the normal range of white, gray, dapple gray, bay, sorrel, chestnut, and black. Setting specific breeds:

Uplands: Coursers, racing horses, riding horses, coach horses; coloration tends towards blue roan or strawberry roan.

Valebred: Chargers, riding horses, coach horses, draft horses; coloration tends towards dark gray or black.

Westfields: Destriers, draft horses, work horses; coloration tends towards bay, with the best animals usually cremelo or buckskin.

**Cattle For general flavor in description, the Castle Keeper can use standard breeds of earth—Aberdeen Angus, Galloway, Hereford, Red Polled, Shorthorn for beef; Ayrshire, Dutch Belted, Guernsey, Holstein-Frisian, Jersey, Kerry for milk; Brown Swiss, Charolais, and Retinta for tri-purpose (draft, meat, milk) cattle.

**Meadland** A large dual-purpose animal for meat and milk, with long, lyre-shaped horns, and a vertically striped coat of tan to buff with thin bands of brown or red.

**Sheep **& **Goats Use the models of the Rambouillet sheep and the black & white Bagot and Valais Blackneck goat.

**Southdowns A large and hardy breed of tri-purpose (wool, meat, milk) sheep. A full-grown ram will weigh between 250 and 300 pounds, a ewe about two-thirds that. Despite selective breeding, about half of a typical flock will have black, dark brown, of sorrel red wool. Rams have large, curling horns, eyes small ones.

**Menhir **Hills A very large breed of hairy dual-purpose (meat and milk) goats with a full-grown billy in the 150 pound range. The front half of the animal is red-black or black, the hind part white or ivory. Males and females have long horns forming a Y-shape above their head, billies having longer and thicker ones.

###### 224

**Swine Chose the model or models you prefer—Berkshire (medium sized black with white muzzle and socks, meat producer), Durok (large sized light golden to mahogany red meat producer), Gloucestershire (large sized white with black spots lard and meat producer), or Tamworth (smaller sized golden red to deep red, bacon producer).

**Hillwood** A large dual-purpose animal for lard and meat—less lard if allowed range in the open. These swine are long-legged and high-bodied, their coat dark brown with two horizontal bands of sandy color on their flanks. An adult boar can weigh as much as 800 pounds, but the average is around 650.

**Swans, **Geese, **& **Ducks Swans are either black or white; no more needs be said. The white Embden goose and the big gray Toulouse (white hindquarters, blackish back and wings) are sufficient for covering geese. One must have both white (Pekin) and colorful (Rouen, a large, Mallard-like species with more read in the drake’s breast) ducks.

**Turkeys, Peafowl, Chickens, & Guinea Fowl** As there is commerce between al the continents, it is not unreasonable to include turkeys in the roster of farm poultry. Those raised will look like our domesticated wild turkeys, with no white variety seen. The same applies to peafowl.

As chickens will be seen in many places, the following breeds are suggested fir varying descriptions: Andalusian (speckled black and gray), Houdan (white), Brown Leghorn (rooster: white ear, red neck and back, lower body green fading to black at legs, upper wing red, middle green, end buff, tail green; hen: white ear, brown and black speckled neck, throat and breast rosy brown fading to rosy buff at legs, brown lower body below brown-black wings and tail), Minorca (black) Buff Orpington (buff), and Rhode Island Red (bright rust red with tail end feathers green).

Guinea fowl look a good deal like small, combless chickens with coloration ranging from a near white through light gray to medium brown gray, no distinction between male and female is apparent. The cock is aggressive and will fight off a hawk, giving off a warning cry when so threatened or when any feral animal or stranger is detected. The meat of one of these fowls is gamy in flavor and much appreciated by those who enjoy wild game.

**Doves & Pigeons** Both doves and pigeons will be kept for food. Homing pigeons will also be raised for carrying messages. The Game Master should have no problem describing these well- known and common birds.

**Rabbits** Angora, Belgian Hare, and Flemish Giant rabbit breeds will serve as models for domesticated rabbits.


Appendix F, Magic Items and Spells

# Appendix F

## Magic Items and Spells

**Amulet **of **Counter-Enthralling This small amulet appears to be a oval silver mirror of 2: diameter edged in gold trim. When worn, it grants a bonus of +10 to any saving throws involving powers that captivate or fascinate, including those of magical nature, that the wielder makes.

**Armbands **of **the **Ape These armbands seem to be made of gorilla hide, and lace closed on the inside of the forearm with heavy sinew cord. Once cinched into place on the arms, the magical armbands confer both a strength bonus and a climbing bonus to the wearer. The strength bonus has a range of +1 to +6 to the attribute. This number modifies all to hit and damage rolls. It is not used in conjunction with strength modifiers and supercedes it only in cases where the bonus conferred by the belt is greater than that conferred by the strength score. The climb bonus confers a standard +5 to all climbing and agility (Dexterity) checks.

**Belt **of **Strength: (replace with Belt of Giant Strength)

**Blades **of **Stunning: These blade weapons come in many different types (from daggers to 2-handed swords) but all have the similar ability to stun an opponent in combat. Should the blade be used in a successful attack, whatever is hit must make a saving throw versus Intelligence or be stunned and unable to act for one full round.

**Bracelet of ventriloquism:** Appearing as an ivory bracelet with different sigils inscribed up it, this enchanted bracelet gives the wearer the ability to use a Ventriloquism spell (see Players Handbook) at will. The magical effects are quite powerful, and they react to disbelief as if cast by a 9th level Illusionist.

**Cap **of **influence: This red velvet cap with gold and silver accents is enchanted to give its wearer the ability to charm those beholding them as if a Charm spell was cast. The target of the effect gains the normal saving throw, but suffers a –2 penalty due to the potent eldritch powers imbued within its construction.

**Cap of intuition: [alerts the wearer of aggression] This innocuous leather cap appears worn and unremarkable to the casual observer. But when donned it grants the wearer the ability to sense the imminent presence of danger to his or her person and the initiative to act appropriately. In game terms this means that the wearer will only be surprised if their combat surprise check (Wisdom) rolls a “natural” 20. Otherwise they are considered not surprised and automatically gain the initiative during the first round of any combat.

**Cape of Displacement: (Replace with Cloak of Displacement)

**Cloak of Concealment:** This magical cloak comes in many shapes and forms. Usually it is made from the finest materials available but on occasion it can appear as meanly made. Its power rests in the arcane enchantments cast upon it, a dweomer that allows the wearer to blend into their surrounding environment and conceal themselves from the eyes of others. A hide check is

###### 225

Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

made and if successful, the wearer is essentially invisible to anyone looking on. If the wearer makes any movement while being observed, the magical concealment is lost. Each cloak is different in make and enchantment, conferring a variable bonus of +0 to

+5 to Hide checks. Further, the nature of the cloak is such that it automatically confers a +1 to the armor class of the wearer.

**Cloak **of **nondescript **appearance: This cloak is made of a faded grey wool and appears like many cloaks of the same mundane cut and wear. Indeed, this innocuousness is the fount of its magic. Anyone who places the cloak upon themselves and attaches themselves to a group (group defined as at least 2 other creatures) then the cloaked person appears unremarkable and as simply another face in the crowd of beings they are associating with. Anyone attempting to find this person after they don the cloak and join a group must take a –8 penalty to their Wisdom check to find the individual. Furthermore, the other members of the group joined by the cloaked person must make a saving throw versus Intelligence at –4 to recognize that the person in the midsts in fact is different and doesn’t belong. Otherwise they will accept the person’s presence and actions as if engendered by one of their own.

**Cloak **of **the **Woodlands (Change to Cloak of Elvenkind)

**Dagger **of **Questions: This magical +2 dagger allows the wielder to ask three yes or no questions a day. A successful wisdom check indicates the dagger will answer in the affirmative or negative. Any answers will follow the procedure of the Augury cleric spell (see Players Handbook).

**Darts **of **Cavorting: These polished brass darts are usually found in groups of 6-12 (1d6+6). When cast at an opponent, they attack as +3 magic weapons and inflict 2 hit points of damage. Additionally, the struck target must make a saving throw versus Intelligence or caper and gambol off, dancing this jig for one hour. While under the spell of this cavorting, the victim cannot attack or cast any spells that require somatic components.

**Flame Gout Potion:** After quaffing all eight ounces of this magical draught, the one so doing will (in 10 minutes of time) be capable of sending forth a fiery column from his mouth. This flame is 10 feet long, 2 feet in diameter at its terminus, and inflicts 2-9 (1d8+1) hit points of damage upon anything within its radius of effect, no attack roll necessary. The consumer is able to breathe forth a fiery gout thus every other round, to a maximum of eight times. Sending forth a flame gout is in addition to any other action not requiring use of the mouth, such as speaking. If not so breathed out, the magical liquid loses its efficacy one hour after becoming active. Sale Value: 1,000; XP Value: 250

**Gnigul’s **Swift **Flying **Skiff: The magical craft appears as a small plaque depicting a miniature rowboat. One command word attunes the plaque to a person, making that person the controller of the vessel. A second command word makes it grow to a normal- sized boat, or transform back to a plaque. The second command word allows it to fly via the concentration of the owner. The boat is very fast, and can achieve a speed of up to 75 miles per hour provided the craft maintains at least a 500 foot altitude and at least a distance of 300 feet away from any larger-than-man-sized


flying creature, otherwise it slows to the equivalent of a slow flying speed of 60 mpgh. Mentally steering the boat requires moderate concentration, although the boat can maintain a current course or hover without the attention of the controller.

**Lens of Scrutiny:** This circular prism enables those that gaze through it to identify counterfeit items or false creations, evin if such fakery was done with magic. If used to discern illusions, the user of the lens gains a +8 to the Intelligence attribute check. Also, the lens may be used to determine if items are magical or not with a successful Wisdom check at CL 16 (10 for spellcasters). The lens is usually found set within a frame with a handle to allow its proper use.

**Mask of disguising:** This mask looks like a simple theatrical mask, appearing as either the traditional “Comedy” or “Tragedy” displays. When placed upon the face and the command word is uttered, the masks enchantment will disguise the person as any humanoid figure they can imagine. The disguise is quite skillful and any attempts to discern the person’s true identitu will be modified as if the disguise was crafted by a 9th level Assassin. When the mask is removed, the disguise is lifted and will require another use of the command word to reinstate a disguise.

**Net of catching:** This finely woven net appears at first glance to be made of thin cord, but close examination will show that each strand is comprised of tiny chain rings seamlessly linked into the patterns of the entire net. It is lightweight (only .5 encumbrance) but quite strong, resisting attacks with an AC of 30 and seems to repair any damage to itself at the rate of one foot per hour. Such an enchanted net usually covers about 15 feet in diameter and may either be cast upon opponents or throw itself upon a target from a hidden position either underneath or above the victim. Upon uttering the command word, the net will magically wind itself around the victim (saving throw versus Dexterity to avoid) and thus render them hopelessly entangled and unable to perform most actions. At the Castle Keeper’s discretion, the entrapped being may attempt to free themselves, but a minimum Strength of 20 is required to even attempt unwinding the net, and only magic weapons may inflict damage to the net’s strands upon a successful hit. Naturally, the wielder may command it to loosen its grip as well as to reset itself for another target.

**Pipe **of **the **Sandman: This is a long stemmed, small bowled pipe made of sandstone. It always has tobacco in it, and the weed has a pleasing and tantalizing aroma. Any character who lights and inhales the smoke of the pipe will be affected as under a Sleep spell, which will have full effect regardless of the smoker’s Hit Dice.

**Ring of paralysis:** This small steel ring is enchanged with the ability to cast a magical force upon a target, rendering them unable to move for 1 hour for each charge used (saving throw versus Dexterity at –4 penalty to avoid). These rings usually contain 20 charges and are rechargeable by a Master Wizard.

**Ring of the Chameleon:** This thick ring appears to be made of clear glass, but is invulnerable to being shattered or nicked. When activated the magical ring acts to hide the wearer by making him blend into the colors and hues of any background material. The

###### 226

ring also allows the wearer to assume the color and general texture of whatever is behind the wearer, even if it is a multicolored background and of variable textureds. The background area should be relatively stable and can include bushes, savannah, buildings, flame and the like but not moving objects such as people walking down a street. The wearer gets to make a Hide check regardless of whether they possess the ability and check as if equal to a 5th level Rogue (+5).

**Staff **of **Withering: this oak and wormwood staff acts as a +1 magic Quarterstaff that deals normal hit point damage. Additionally, the wielder can inflict 1d4 points of temporary Strength damage and 1d4 points of temporary Constitution damage to any creature struck with the staff. If the wielder rolls a “natural” 20 on their to hit roll, the attribute damage from that strike is permanent and the victim must make a saving throw versus Constitution or be aged 11-20 (1d10+10) years. Note the withering will not effect Outsiders or Undead, and might even aid creatures who grow in power as they age such as dragons.

**Syrinx **of **Sylvan **Summoning: this enchanted musical instrument can be played no more than once per week. If this miniature instrument of gold actually put to the lips, it grows to normal size, and when played or blown into one of the following will appear to assist the one playing upon it:

1d20	Summonings

1-7	3-6 satyrs

8-13	3-6 silini

14-17	3-6 stacentaurs

18-19	3-6 centaurs

20	Pan appears (or no effect)

If the demigod Pan decides to manifest, he will not be pleased with characters who have killed his wild woodfolk, but if they are humble and grovel, it is likely that he will merely send the party on a quest to slay some horrible monster, bring back proof of the deed to the place he appeared to them, and also with such proof all the treasure possessed by the monster slain. If the characters continue to be polite at this point, he will allow them half of the loot, giving the balance to his forest folk. If the party is rude, or the party ever comes back to attack Pan’s minions here, they should be treated brutally, with Pan reappearing and causing them to become blind or a like punishment.

**The Gold Torque:** This burnished gold and bejeweled collar flashes with a mélange of metallic hues; an ornamental torque of ancient times and lands that irresistibly draws the eye of any near it. The Torque’s magical powers granted to its wearer are considerable. The wearer of the torque gains a temporary +1 to all attributes. Also, the wearer is able to know and cast daily three 1st level, two 2nd level, and 1 3rd level druid spell regardless of their actual class(es). When a Druid dons the torque, he or she gains a permenant additional level of experience as well as the other abilities listed above. If the item is worn by a non-druid, this artifact causes the individual to become increasingly introverted and desirous of the solitude of the wilderness for contemplation and communing with nature. The end result if not given away will be that the possessor inevitably becomes a hermit dwelling in some wild and lonely woodland.

**Baton **of **Surprising **Results: The Baton of Surprising Results is a wondrous and unpredictable device that randomly generates any number of weird effects each time its power is invoked.

The usual results of summoning of the Baton’s dweomer is detailed below, but the Castle Keeper is encouraged to invent their own powers and effects as desired.

(Either replace with Staff of Frost or say the Baton works as a Staff of Frost but with less charges?)

##### Spells

**Animate Rock:** The spell imbues stone or other non-crystalline minerals with mobility. The animated rocks then attack whomever or whatever the caster first designates. Animated rocks gain humanlike senses. The rocks’ AC, attacks, and special abilities vary with their size and form, as described for animated objects. The caster can animate up to 500 pounds of mineral substance per level of the caster. All rocks to be affected must be within 50 feet of each other. The caster can animate a variety of types of different rocks if desired. The effect lasts 1 hour per caster level.

If the spell is cast upon a stone golem, the caster’s level is compared to the golem’s Hit Die (or the level of the creator of the golem, whichever is higher). If the caster of this spell’s level is higher than the opposing HD/level, they may seize control of the golem, though the golem will attempt to resist the control. Treat this resistance as the same procedure as a golem breaking the control of its creator (see Monsters & Treasure). CT 1, RAD 150 ft, AoE 50 ft diameter. circle, see text, Sv see text, SR yes (see text), Comp V, M-ball of malleable clay.

**Protection from Slumber:** Protective magical energies merge with the cleric, providing some measure of resistance against any spells or spell-like effects that induce sleep or other comatose states. The dweomer grants the caster and any within its area of effect a Charisma saving throw versus such effects; even if the spell or spell-like effect does not normally grant such a save. If the effect usually allows a saving throw, this protection grants a +2 to saves by those within the protective sphere. However, if the caster fails their saving throw and is rendered comatose then the spell fails and those within the area of effect must immediately make a second saving throw to resist the slumbering magics. CT 1, RAD 10 feet,  10 min/lvl or until discharged, Sv none, SR yes, Comp

**Unseen **Scribe: By means of this incantation, an invisible spirit is summoned from the outer planes to act as a scribe for the Wizard who conjured it forth. Unlike Unseen Servant, the invoked entity is limited to either transcribing dictation or copying other works that are presented to it.

If the unseen scribe is asked to transcribe a magical spell into a spellbook, the wizard who summoned the scribe must make an saving throw versus Intelligence with a penalty equal to the level of the spell. For example, a roll to attempt to copy a 4th level spell would incur a –4 penalty to the save. If the saving throw is successful, the unseen scribe copies the spell exactly. If the roll is failed, the scribe is immediately banished to its home plane and the controlling wizard takes 1 hit point of damage for each level of the spell that the scribe attempted to transcribe.

Even if successful, the amount of time to copy the spell is considerable; requiring 60 minutes of time per level of the spell being copied. While this spell is in effect the wizard is distracted by his or her control of the unseen scribe and may be surprised and will always lose initiative during the opening round of combat.

There are many species of bats. The most common bats are nocturnal animals that dwell in caves, dungeons or other underground complexes. These are small creatures, about the size of any common house rat. Fruit bats are most commonly encountered living n tall trees. These creatures are much larger than their cousins, growing as large as small ponies at times. Bats live in large colonies, though on occasion a single or small number of bats are encountered. They are not aggressive, leaving their colony only at night to hunt insects, or fruit. When they do so, they travel in large clouds of many hundreds. Some few species of bat are blood drinkers. These feed by attaching themselves to a statinary object, biting and sucking blood until they are full They will not attack a determined foe

Giant catfish are very aggressive and territorial river fish found in temperate waters. They are voracious eaters and attack almost anything they think they can swallow. They range in size from 10’ to 20+. These monstrous fish are both the pride and fear of fisherman.

**Combat:** Giant catfish attack by rushing an opponent and attempting to swallow it. They have boney jaws that deal 1d6 points of damage and long feelers that are both ridged and jagged. Being brushed with the catfish’s feelers causes 1d4 points

of damage. A giant catfish’s hit dice is determined by its length; 10’ = 5 HD, 12’ = 6 HD, and so on to 20’ = 10 HD.

**Poison:** The feelers of a giant catfish can deliver a mild contact poison. When a giant catfish’s feelers cut a victim they leave behind an irritating residue that causes 1d4 points of damage per round for 4 rounds. A successful constitution save reduces the damage by half.

**Swallow Whole:** On a score of a natural 20 a giant catfish can swallow whole any creature 1/3 its size. The victim must make a dexterity save (CL 3) to avoid being swallowed. If a target subject is swallowed, bite damage is continued each round thereafter, that being the amount of demage being delivered to the victim by the digestive acids of the fish. Attack from inside a giant catfish can be made by any dagger, knife, or stabbing sword. In this case the fish’s armor class is 10, and all damage delivered from inside is double normal.

A giant clam is simply a very large bivalve of from four to six feet width with a hard and thick shell. They are found in warm fresh or salt water. They are often found in the midsts of large beds of other smaller clams and muslces. They are valued by fisherman both as a food source and for their potential of containing a giant pearl. The chance that one of these mollusks has a pearl inside is 10%, and the value of one will be from $500-$3,000 wholesale.

**Combat:** A giant clam rests on the bottom of the ocean floor or river bed waiting for something to land upon its opoen mouth. Once closed on a victim, the clam will keep its shell shut until the victim is dead by damage or drowning. Decomposing flesh will be drawn in and consumed by the clam. Note a clam with a trapped victim has an armor class of 10, if a pointed weapon is thrust between its valves.

**Continuing **Damage: Once a giant clam has successfully bitten a victim it does not have to strike again. Each round thereafter the clam does normal bite damage. To escape a giant clam’s bite the clam must be killed or the victim must make a successful strength save to break free.

Huge crayfish are not very aggressive, though defend themselves when attacked. They make their dens in small caves or under the ledges of large overhangs.


**Combat:** At first encounter a huge crayfish attempts to swim away, using its large tail to propel itself backwards through the water. If cornered they use their claws to pinch and grab their tormentors.

**Continuing Damage:** Once a huge crayfish has successfully grabbed a victim it does not have to strike again. Each round thereafter the crayfish does 2d3 points of damage per claw per round.

A cyclops is a form of giant, some 15 feet in average height. It has only a single, large central eye. Although its vision is not stereoscopic, it has extremely acute hearing, so audial and olfactory senses make up for lack of keen sight. A cyclops prefers to dwell in large caverns, but on occasion one makes do with a crude, log hut. The species is omnivorous, but loves flesh, particularly of the human sort, washed down by copious amounts of beer, ale, or wine if that is available. Animal skins are the typical garb worn. Cyclopses are solitary and reclusive and do not associate, but for rare occasions, with any other sorts of creatures.

If a cyclops has captured and devoured human victims, whatever these unfortunates had with them is tossed into a corner and brought out only for the purposes of trade. They are not above trading for beer or other good spirits, even with humans, and will often allow their trading partners to rifle through the treasure on hand.

**Combat:** A cyclops is merciless in the attack. Normally slow moving, they often deceive their victims into believing that escape is but a leap away. But the cyclops uses his club attempting to knock the feet from under any would be tormentor or dinner. Once down they turn the creature to pulp with repeated blows.

**Rock Throwing:** Cyclops can hurl boulders up to 510 feet, inflicting 2-10 points of damage.

Hama dryads and much the same as their lesser kin. They are wild, fey creatures of resplendent beauty. They live in seclusion in the deepest parts of ancient forests. Shy and non-violent, dryads always attempt to flee from danger. They can literally step into one tree and out of another as they escape.

Hama dryads are lonely creatures, and they seek to be fawned over and loved for their beauty. For this reason, they often keep men of power or prestige bound to them for many years. Exceptionally handsome men attract the attention of dryads, and a dryad may reveal itself to such an individual, in an attempt to charm and seduce him.

Every hama dryad is mystically bound to a single, enormous hardwood tree, typically an oak or beech, from which she can never stray more than 300 yards. A dryad’s tree does not radiate magic. Dryads possess a great deal of knowledge about the area surrounding their forests, and can communicate with any plant that grows naturally in their habitat.

**Combat:** Dryads always try to retreat from combat, using thick underbrush and briar patches around their homes to evade pursuit. They can also make quick escapes through the trees themselves (see tree stride). Often they will feign being wounded, or call for mercy, only to flee quickly once the enemy hesitates. If pressed to fight, a dryad uses a dagger and tries to turn opponents against each other with her potent charm ability.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** Hama dryads cast all spells as a 15th level spell caster. They can cast command (12/day), _calm _auimal (12/ day), _charm persou_ (6/day), _fasciuate_ (6/day). They have the ability to cast druid spells as 15th level druid and have the following number of druid spells: 0-6, 1st-6, 2nd-6, 3rd-6, 4th-4, 5st-4, 6th-3, 7th-2, 8th-1. Saving throws against the dryad’s charm ability are made at CL 5.

**Tree **Stride: A dryad is able to travel quickly in its natural habitat by passing through trees. A dryad can magically enter a tree and move to any other tree within 50 feet, in one round. The next round, the dryad can leave the currently occupied tree and move to another. Dryads can do this only four times per day, but they can always meld with their bonded tree.

The gray dwarf race is similar in build to normal dwarves, but they are leaner. An evil visage and straggling head and facial hair coupled with a complexion of grey to dun hue marks one immediately for a member of this malign race. They wear dark garments, favoring black, charcoal gray, or hues like those of their stony lairs—dark brown, red-brown, and yellow-gray.

Gray dwarves are formed in clans, with a chief of 7th to 9th level fighter (AC 19, +4 damage), a cleric of 5th to 6th level (AC 18). For every 20 warriors encountered there will be one sub-chief of 4th to 5th level (AC 18, +3 damage) and one smith equal to a sub- chief. Fore every 10 fighters encountered there will be one leading warrior of 2nd to 3rd level (AC 17, +2 damage). In some habitats there will be female dwarves equal to the number of males plus or minus 5%, of whom 10% will be combatant warriors, and children equal to 10% of the female total, all non-combatants.

Gray dwarves possess all the abilities of regular dwarves. Please consult the Monsters and Treasure for a complete listing.

**Combat:** Gray dwarves are skilled warriors and always combine might with magic when in battle. They use their powers of illusions to confuse and confound an enemy before they attack with iron and steel. When arrayed for battle the common armor is well-crafted chain mail with shield, arms include axes and military hammers, with throwing hammers as a main missile weapon. Those encountered will use one of the following weapons choices: light crossbow and hammer (25%), battle axes (25%), footman’s military pick (25%), spear and short sword (25%).

**Illusion: All gray dwarves are able to generate illusion magic by concentration, doing nothing else that round while effecting the illusion desired. They are in turn subject to like mind-generated illusions effected by one with a stronger ability to do so. This illusion ability includes “invisibility” to all creatures affected by their will not to be seen except during a round when they are attacking. Thinking creatures have a chance to resist the mental effect of the willed illusion. The chance for resisting is discovered by rolling against Intelligence -12, and any score on d20 that is equal to or less than that number indicates the individual is not affected by mind-willed illusions for one hour. Only one check for resistance per person can be made each hour.

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

A _dispel _magic or _detect _illusiou spell will reveal the gray dwarves to the caster, and that individual will then see all such creatures and their illusions plainly for the following hour. If the spell caster touches another individual while casting either spell, that person will likewise be empowered to see thus. A spell-caster who is already under the effect of either spell can touch two others when casting a _dispel _magic or _detect _illusiou spell, and both will then be able to see the gray dwarves and their illusions for one hour. Druidic _faerie _fire will serve to make Gray Dwarves visible in outline. _Obscuriug mist_ or wall of fog will make gray dwarves visible in outline within the area of cloudiness.

When an illusion generated by a Gray Dwarf is struck by anything that would cause 1 or more points of damage to an actual living thing the phantom image wavers and seems to collapse as if melting incredibly fast. There is no trace of any “body” where the illusion was destroyed.

Forest giants are reclusive giants that are found most commonly in the deeps of deciduous forests. They average 12 feet in height with olive or moss green colored skin, with dark colored hair and beards. These giants are keen hunters and possess excellent senses, vision, hearing and smell. They usually wear animal skins or wear crudely sewn leather clothes. Forest giants prefer to dwell in a cave in deep in its forest home. On occasion they construct log houses as well. These structures are always made of hardwoods 18 inches to 2 feet thick. Forest giants are omnivorous, particularly enjoying stews made of humans, gnomes or dwarves. As with most giants, this species is avaricious, loving precious metals, bright metallic objects such as swords and the like, jewelry, and gems of a size meaningful to it. (Thus most gems possessed will be large, low-value amethyst and quartz ones.) Their horde will be hidden near their dwelling place, in a cavity of stone or hard-packed earth and covered by a large rock.

Forest giants tend to remain in nuclear family groups, thus but do not mind meeting and associating with their own kind or hill or mountain giants. Encounters with one forest giant, a family of three to five, or one to three adults or family groups are equally likely. They dislike noisy humanoids, tend to kill and eat them, but bugbears are tolerated. Adult forest giants always have 7-12 hit points per hit die, the young 1-6 hit points per die.


**Combat:** Forest giants are stealthy hunters and are able to blend with their environment. When they hunt they find game trails and stand motionless for many hours, waiting for a victim to pass. To the casual observer they look little different than the surrounding trees. They strike with their club first, trying to knock an opponent down before they tenderize their meal with their club or fists.

**Camouflage: Forest giants can conceal themselves exceptionally well while they are in the forest. When concealed and motionless, they receive a +5 bonus to hide checks, and a +10 to surprise checks.

**Rock Throwing:** Forest giants can hurl boulders up to 450 feet, inflicting 4-16 points of damage.

Water giants dwell in deep waters, salt or fresh, running or still. They are large for giant kin, towering on average 17 feet high. With skin of aquamarine, the color of shallow tropical sea water, they blend with their watery homes. Water giants have both gills and lungs, and is able to operate in the air as well as in fresh or salt water. They have excellent senses of hearing and touch (vibrations in the water), but about half human normal sight and smell. Their Intellect is on par with that of the average human. Their fingers and toes are unnaturally long and webbed. They also possess a length of binding skin that stretches from their midriff to their forearms. Both these adaptations allow the water giant to swim effectively and at great speeds. Water giants prefer to dwell in underwater grottos, where they fashion for themselves comfortable and defensible homes. They will not stray out of water for more than a few hours as their scaled skin becomes dry and they become uncomfortable. No clothing is worn, although one might have a harness and belt to hold backpack-sided pouches and other items. As with most giants, this species is avaricious. Their horde will be hidden near their dwelling place, in a cavity of stone or a sunken strongbox, covered by rocks and seaweed.

Water giants tend to remain solitary, and when more than one (from two to five) is encountered it will be a nuclear family group. They rarely gather in larger numbers unless some great danger threatens, and they do not associate with other sorts of giants. Water giants are omnivorous but not prone to eat human or like kinds of flesh, preferring fish and other aquatic creatures for food. Adult water giants always have 7-12 hit points per hit die, the young 1-6 hit points per die.

**Combat: Water giants are skilled swimmers and are able to hide within their own environment. They only attack from a distance, falling back initially if necessary. They use the distance to gain as much speed as they can so that they can charge and impale an opponent with their trident. A water giant attacking like this gains a +2 to his attack and does double damage on the first round if he successfully hits. If pinned the giant attempts to drag the victim to the deeps to drown it or otherwise kill it.

**Camouflage:** When immersed in water one of these giants can conceal themselves exceptionally well while they are in the forest. When concealed and motionless, they receive a +5 bonus to hide checks, and a +10 to surprise checks.

**Water Spray: At the surface of the water they are able to send a blinding sheet of spray 30 feet wide and up to 60 feet distance that causes all struck to be stunned for 1-4 rounds unless they make a successful dexterity save.

These creatures are a magically engendered bipedal vegetable life form that is humanoid in size and shape and as fully mobile on the ground or in trees, and as strong, as a male orangutan. They have limited olfactory and visual capacity (50% human normal) but its senses of hearing and touch (detecting heat and vibrations) are incredibly keen. They have extreme animal cunning. Any warm temperate forest is a suitable habitat, as a greenman will burrow into the earth when frost threatens, and remain below the frost line therein until warmer temperatures return. The species can root for nourishment, and photosynthesis is active in skin cells. As part of its reproduction process, a greenman needs to feed on large amounts of warm blood, particularly human sort. After doing so it will grow wide and split into two, much the way an amoeba reproduces. Their evil nature was bread into the species by the wicked druid that created it.

A greenman’s skin is smooth but very tough and resilient, and thus their armor class. Spells that affect flora will work upon a greenman, as one is a plant, but as it has volition it will resist those that command action (25% chance for success). Greenmen are cooperative with each other and are thus usually encountered in groups. If they are being hunted, the group will work cooperatively to prepare defensive traps, snares, deadfalls, and pit traps. They do not have a lair and are unlikely to have any treasure.

###### Appendix G, Monsters

**Combat:** Greenmen attack any man-sized or smaller warm- blooded creature by using its left arm’s mutability to form it into a lasso of leather cord-like strength and loop it over the head and around the neck of its victim. This noose is sticky with sap from the creature, so once in place it stays put even if it is severed (8 HP), and continues to inflict damage of 1-4 HP per round until it is loosened by water of like liquid.

**Camouflage:** A greenman can conceal itself exceptionally well while they are in the forest or in other thick vegetation. When concealed and motionless, they receive a +6 bonus to hide checks, and a +12 to surprise checks.

**Mutability:** A greenman is able to shape shift its left arm into almost any shape. In doing so it draws mass from the rest of the creature’s body. They can create very long, thin strands, or heavy, thick protrusions. They most commonly use this to strangulate a victim. The appendage is sticky and thorny causing extra damage and making breaking free difficult. To break the hold of a greenman requires a successful strength save (CL 2).

**Regeneration: In daytime they regenerate 1 lost hit point per round if in contact with soil.

These creatures dwell in the murky waters of swamps, stagnate pools and the like or in the deeps of the ocean often near shipwrecks or other scenes of struggle and death.

**Combat:** Lacedons are mindless, and attack with a wild ferocity akin to that of rabid animals. They are always hungry, and will often stop in the middle of a battle to feast upon a fallen foe.

**Paralysis: Any living creature, other than an elf, that is clawed or bitten by a ghoul must make a strength save or be paralysed. This paralysis lasts 1d4+1 turns, or a remove curse or remove paralysis spell is cast upon the victim. Elves are immune to ghoul paralysis.

A giant leach is similar to normal leaches but for its size. They range from 7 inches to 1 foot in length. They live in the mud banks and shallow bottoms of waters. Movement near a leach attracts it. They are usually found in large pods of up to 30.

**Combat:** Leaches don’t attack, but rather attach themselves to passing hosts through their pincer like mouths. Once attached the suck the victims blood.


**Continuing Damage:** Once a leach has successfully bitten a victim it does not have to strike again. Each round thereafter the leach does 1 points of damage per round. To escape the leach must be killed or the victim must make a successful strength save to pull the leach off (CL -4).

Shaman mummies are found in enclosed burial chamber and have usually been sanctified by ritual magics upon internment. They are an undead creature wrapped in divine bandages and urged to existence through prayer and ceremony. Mummies are bound to their tombs and are encountered in their vicinity. Any creature that defiles or loots the tomb of a mummy is doomed to face the mummy’s wrath. Their connection with the artifacts of life and the resting places of the dead are tremendous, and they punish grave looters with unmediated violence.

The process required to create a mummy gives the creature powerful protections against physical damage. However, the most terrifying aspect of a mummy is not its ability to withstand damage or doggedly pursue its quarry, but its lingering effects upon those that managed to escape. The touch of a mummy instills a disease that causes a victim’s body to slowly wilting and rotting away into a useless mass of pulpy flesh. These creatures are often created in pairs, but the most unholy sanctums can be guarded by up to eight.

**Combat:** Mummies enter combat without fear. They do not take prisoners, and do not bargain or communicate. They batter their foes until victorious, or the mummies themselves are destroyed. Sleep and charm spells, as well as poison and paralysis, have no affect on mummies. They can only be hit and damaged by magical weapons.

**Despair:** The mere sight of a mummy causes an opponent to become unnerved, shaken and repulsed. This affect is identical to the spell fear. In addition, an additional wisdom save is required by all opponents. If the save fails, that victim is paralyzed by the mummy’s presence, and remains so for 1d4 rounds. Humans gain a +2 bonus to resist this effect. There is safety and security in numbers, however. All individuals in a group will gain a +1 bonus if group members outnumber mummies present by at least 6 to 1. This bonus is cumulative to the bonus given to humans. For example, if two mummies are present, 12 group members are required to gain a +1 bonus, giving humans a total of +3.

###### 234

**Mummy Rot:** A victim stricken by this horrible affliction contracts a dreadful disease that resists natural methods of healing. Only the spell cure disease can remove Mummy Rot. Each time a victim is struck by a mummy, a successful constitution save is required to resist the mummy’s scabrous touch. Failure indicates that the creature has been afflicted with the Rot, and no further saves are allowed. While afflicted with Mummy Rot, magical spells and effects that restore hit points do not function on the victim. Methods of natural healing, including regeneration, are 10 times slower. In addition, a victim of Mummy Rot loses two points of charisma each month, permanently, culminating in the victim’s death 1d6 months after exposure and contraction.

**Subject **to **Raising: A mummy targeted by a raise dead spell must succeed at a physical save or be restored from undeath. Most will be transformed into a human fighter of 7th level, but a mummy will typically assume the race and class it had in life. However, the corruption of undeath lingers, and these individuals will retain the lawful evil alignment.

**Spell-like Abilities:** he mummy shaman can cast up to six spells of cleric, druid, or magic-user sort in any combination. One spell at least is likely to be a unique sort of magic.

A greater naiad is a powerful creature of fey. These semi-goddesses are aquatic creatures that take the forms of beautiful human or elfin females. They occupy any body of water from as small as a spring to as large as a river or lake. Once they have chosen a home they remain there, nurturing and protecting the water way. They are solitary creatures, desiring little or no company and take comfort in the solace of the natural world. They take companions only when they desire to and they have met someone of surpassing beauty. They will defend their home against any and all who threaten it. Naiads are invisible unless they purposely make themselves otherwise. If humans are polluting their body of water or otherwise making it less desirable, the naiad will use her best efforts to drive the offender(s) away, seek help from her sisters in time of great need. They make their physical homes in underwater caverns or very deep pools.

**Combat:** Naiad avoid combat by remaining invisible. If pressed into a fight or forced to defend their territory they at first attempt to enrapture one or more of the powerful aggressors with their

divine beauty. They follow that up by using their spell like abilities, always preferring to cast from a distance...spells such as lightening bolt. They also can change shape to confuse an enemy or summon monsters for aid.

**Natural Invisibility:** An greater naiad is constantly invisible, even when attacking. This ability is inherent and natural to this creature, and is not subject to any spell or effect that negates or detects invisibility. Creatures able to see the invisible still cannot see an invisible stalker, and _true _seeiug will not reveal the presence of one.

**Summon Monster:** A greater naiad is able to command aquatic creatures within as many feet distance as her number of hit dice multiplied by 10. The number she can control thus is up to twice as many hit dice as the naiad’s own. These creatures range from fish to sharks and from turtles to snakes, but must be indigenous to her lair.

**Shape Change:** The greater naiad can assume the form of any small (from shrew to swan) or medium sized animal at will.

**Spell-like **Abilities: A greater naiad is able to use spells as a cleric, mage or druid. The hit dice of a naiad indicates her level of spell use. Thus a naiad with 10 hit dice might be a 10th level cleric, druid, or magic-user. She casts as a 10th level and may only use spells available to 10th level spell casters.

**Divine **Beauty: Seeing a naiad is likely to cause any human, demi- human, or humanoid male to become enraptured and effectively beguiled, as the _charm persou_ spell, unless the naiad wills otherwise or the subject succeeds in a charisma save. Even if not so enthralled, the male subject will be desirous of possessing the naiad. A greater naiad is able to amplify her already magnificent beauty.

A giant otter average six feet in length, but otherwise looks like a normal otter. As an aggressive carnivore, one can pose a danger to humans if it is hungry or the human seems threatening to young otters nearby. The giant otter is usually encountered paired with a mate, and 50% of the time the pair will have two to four pups, the latter being essentially full-grown 25% of the time. All otters are playful and in process of playing tag or sliding down a grade into water they might cause problems for humans passing afoot or in small water craft.

Grotesqueries that live as subterranean garbage disposals, otyughs have huge, bulky bodies with three thick, toeless legs. They have no head, but their bodies are capped by cavernous maws lined with huge, sharp teeth. Otyughs have long tentacles springing from their bodies that serve to grab any possible meal. Otyughs thrive in filth and decay. They are found in most climates, but always live underground in dungeons, city sewers, or reeking cesspools.

**Combat:** An otyugh’s attack is very forthright: it will attempt to drag victims into its offal-filled lair to kill and devour them. They also may attempt to asphyxiate their victims by thrusting them into heaps of refuse and holding them there.

**Disease:** A victim bitten by an otyugh must succeed at a constitution save. If the save fails, the victim will contract a disease of some sort. These diseases should be minor in effect, and should have a long exposure time. Simply encountering an otyugh is cause for concern, due to the filthy surroundings in which they live. At the end of any encounter with an otyugh, all creatures present must succeed at a constitution save or contract a single disease of the Castle Keeper’s choice.

**Improved Grab:** An otyugh’s tentacles have powerful suction tips that grab and adhere to flesh and metal. Any target hit by a tentacle may make a strength save. If the save fails, the victim is immobilized for one round, pulled toward the otyugh’s maw, and is bitten automatically (inflicting normal bite damage). The otyugh can continue to maintain its hold as long as the victim fails successive strength saves on each following round. However, it cannot attack others while doing so, concentrating on inflicting tentacle and bite damage to the victim instead.

**XP: **900+7 **(involuntary), **4500 **(voluntary)**

Penumbrate shadows are the semi-corporeal spirits of humans, demi-humans, or humanoids that have voluntarily or involuntarily been drained of their life energy yet retain a shadow of life. They appear as translucent chiaroscuro images of themselves as they appeared in life. They are not undead in the true sense due to this tenuous link, but since they feed on the energy of neutral shadowstuff, druids can affect them as clerics do undead. They are not easily turned, their resistance to such being equal to a 7 hit dice monster (or their own hit dice, whichever is higher). A successful confrontation of penumbrate shadows by druids will send them either back to the Plane of Shadow or to a non-corporeal state if they are bound (doomed) to a material location.

The voluntary attainment of the state of being as a penumbrate shadow can be achieved only by a druid who has embraced evil and through enactment of a dreadful ritual found in certain forbidden texts of blackest malevolence. Those voluntarily becoming a penumbrate shadow are of utmost strength and achieve eternal existence on the Plane of Shadow, that existence ending only if their semi-corporeal form is totally annihilated on the Material Plane from whence they came.

Furthermore, voluntary penumbrate shadows are able to re- animate their physical remains whenever they so desire, thus gaining normal physical existence again. Re-animation can be accomplished for a number of days equal to or less than their total number of hit dice, and each day of physical existence thus essentially cause damage equal to one hit die. When this damage to their shadow strength equals zero (0) remaining hit points, penunbrate shadows are forced back into the nether worlds to recuperate lost strength at the rate of one hit point per day.

The number of hit dice possessed by penumbrate shadows is the same as the total they possessed when living, but the potential maximum hit points per die is a constant 10 because of their altered state, no constitution bonus accruing. Voluntary penumbrate shadows have a minimum of 12 hit dice and 60 hit points. If involuntary ones attain such power, 12 hit dice and 60 hit points, they are free of their creator, no longer doomed to a single location, but otherwise unchanged in regards their state. Knowing this, voluntary penumbrate shadows are generally careful to create new (involuntary) ones that have fewer hit dice than the 12 they possess.

###### 236

Appendix G, Monsters

**Immune to normal weapons:** Because of their semi-corporeal state normal weapons affect them but little, any hit inflicting only a single point of damage. Only Magical weapons and attack by spells cause full damage to penumbrate shadows.

**Other Immunities:** Penumbrate shadows are immune to mind- affecting spells including charming, confusion, and sleep. Fear, paralysis, petrifaction, and poison do not affect them; while cold, electricity, and fire inflict only 1 hit point of damage per die of potential damage.

**Vulnerabilities**: Penumbrate shadows are subject to damage from bright light and direct sunlight. Being in direct sunlight or a _light_ or _coutiuual light_ spell cast directly upon one inflicts 1 point of damage per round. A _suuray spell affects them in the same manner as it does undead.

**Combat:** The penumbrate shadow will use its semi-incorporeal form to move through shadowed walls, obstacles, and other solid objects to deter attack while striking from unexpected directions with its Strength draining ability. Those few who have the ability to cast spells (residual from their living form) will cast them at distance, weaking their opponents before moving in to feast on their life energy.

**Create Spawn:** Living victims can be duped or forced into becoming penumbrate shadows by a druid turned to evil enacting the forbidden rite upon them when they are captives or pawns. Even in the latter case, the result is a penumbrate shadow that is enslaved to the voluntary member of this ineffable state of existence that created them. Even if the “master” (i.e.voluntary) shadow is not present, they must obey any other voluntary shadows that are in proximity and command them; so long as such commands are not in conflict with prior orders from their creator.

The creator penumbrate shadow can consign them to one place which they can not leave or have them follow him as servants. Whenever this “master” is within 100 feet of one of his created lesser penumbrate shadows, whatever he commands must be obeyed. In such a case, whenever more than one penumbrate shadow is encountered, one will be a “master” shadow and any others their unwilling vassals. It is quite rare to encounter more than one master type shadow together, as they jealously guard their own power and slaves against all interlopers.

**Strength Drain:** The touch of penumbrate shadows or their weapons draws from the target subjects’ strength energy, that energy being consumed by the attacking shades so as to add to their total hit points, as it makes them stronger thus. When penumbrate shadows attain their maximum hit dice total, they become more powerful and gain another hit die.

**Spell Use:** Shades that were formerly spell-casters have ability at half the level they had attained before becoming shadows. However, if the spell draws upon the energy of the nether planes or is that of illusion, their power is as it was in life.

Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

Degenerate pygmies appear like midget humans of ugly, but not deformed, sort. Their height is about two feet. Because of incessant inbreeding these creatures are of low intelligence, but their lack of intelligence has been replaced by a considerable and cruel animal cunning and heightened sense of sight, hearing, and smell. They move with great stealth, so hearing them approaching is only 50% likely for a keen-eared human (at best). Their complexion is usually dark if their habitat is outdoors, pale if they are generally subterranean. As noted in their movement information, these humanoids are excellent swimmers, able to remain submerged and active for four minutes on average.

These aberrant little humans generally dwell in tribal groups that number from 55 – 100, 25% of the number being immature non- combatants. The group will have a chief that is at least 1 hit dice stronger than the leading warriors of 2 or 3 hit dice. There will also be a shaman in the tribe, a spell-caster not needing books and able to use cleric and/or druid, and/or magic-user spells of up to a level equal to his hit dice, two spells per hit dice. Note that some of a degenerate pygmy shaman’s spells might be special ones that are unique to the individual and tribe.

**Combat**: The degenerate pygmies usually attack from ambush, using their poisoned blowgun darts or arrows and concealment to their greatest effect. They will not engage in melee if they can avoid it, preferring to retreat into their environment and strike again when their enemies have let down their guard.

**Poison **Darts/Arrows**: The degenerate pygmies have refined a virulent poison from the natural substances in their territory and use it to increase the lethality fo their blowgun darts. This poison inflicts an extra 2d6 hit points of damage to any victim being struck by one of their tiny needle like missiles. A successful constitution save reduces this damage by half.

**Concealment**: The little creatures excel at concealing themselves in the terrain they live and hunt within, to compensate for their small size and weak natures. As such, they gain a +10 to armor class during the initial round of combat that they initiate, reflecting their sudden appearance from the surrounding rock and foliage.

They are similar in appearance and behavior to shadows except that due to their diminutive size in life their shadelike forms are no more than 2 feet in height.

Usually found in an enclosed burial chamber or abandoned ruin, they are insane fiends with a lust for living souls and for the life force they relish.

**Combat**: Pygmy shadows engage in combat in a similar manner to their larger shadow cousins, exploiting their dark hue and incorporeal form to strike at will upon their unsuspecting prey.

**Chill Touch**: The strength draining touch of the pygmy shadow inflicts 2-5 hit points of damage and drains 1 point of strength from the victim. If a victim is reduced to 0 strength, they are then transformed into a lesser shadow under the control of their undead slayer. Even if such an encounter is survived by a living creature, the strength remains drained, returning at the rate of 1

A small sea serpent can be encountered in any temperate climes, be they bodies of fresh or salt water. The creature’s intellect is that of an animal such as a snake. One will dwell in a body of water that is expansive and of at least 50 feet depth, lairing in a sunken wreck or some jumble of underwater rocks of cave-like dimensions. The monster has an eel-like body with a head that is a nightmarish combination of a wild boar and a crocodile. The heavily scaled body ranges in size from 35 to 60 feet in length (1d6 x 5’ +30’).

**Combat**: A small sea serpent of any length will attack and enwrap a small boat and crush it in only 5-8 rounds. They do so because they attack whatever they consider prey, and the scent of humans in the vessel is not separated from the material of the boat.

**Surprise **Attack**: Due to its normally submerged nature, the small sea serpent may attack victims with a 50% chance of surprise during the first round of combat. The Castle Keeper should adjust the surprise rolls by giving the serpent a +5 bonus to its check and a –5 penalty to the checks of its opponents during the initial surprise determination of combat.

The massive beak of one of these snapping turtles is large enough to bite something a foot high. These animals are very territorial and stake out a feeding ground for many months. They are very defensive. They are only found in the company of other turtles during mating season.

**Combat:** Giant snapping turtle are not particularly aggressive, but are very territorial. Any creature that steps upon it or molests it in any way is subject to being bitten. Once the turtle bites it does not let go until it is beaten severely or the victim dies. They will attempt to drag creatures into the water where they may drown.

**Continuing Damage:** Once a giant snapping turtle has successfully bitten a victim it does not have to strike again. Each round thereafter the turtle inflicts 2d4 points of damage per round.

They are found in temperate to tropical seas and rocky reefs, and sing out to passing ships songs of their loneliness and desire for companionship.

**Combat**: The water siren prefers to use her song to enrapture her victims and will only engage in melee combat if it is unavoidable or to deliver the killing stroke to a particularly resilient meal.

**Singing**: Any human or similar creature hearing the song of a water siren must save versus charisma or else move directly towards the siren and be charmed. Such subject(s) will then be lured into the water by the siren to drown there, and the corpse serve the creature as food for at least several days. If a subject in water attempts to swim, the siren will attack with her knife or dagger, dragging the victim down into the murky depths to drown. This song can charm all those able to hear it within sight and up to 120 feet distance

###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

An aberrant elder xorn looks like a normal one, save for a golden sheen. Xorn are natives of the elemental plane of earth, but can be found on the mortal realms in certain rare circumstances. They are nearly always found in deep subterranean places. Bizarre in appearance, xorn resemble a stony cylinder with three legs, topped with a gaping, voracious mouth. Spaced evenly around a xorn’s body are three arms; a single eye occupies the space between each arm. Their skin is hard and rock-like. Xorn feed upon gems, rare minerals, and precious metals, and quest for them constantly. Up to 4 of these creatures can be encountered.

Xorn are rare on the mortal realms, for they can not travel the planes themselves. They are occasionally summoned to the prime by powerful wizards that desire to use the xorn for excavating. Xorn are able to dig through earth and stone rapidly, and when pressed can move even quicker through stone, without leaving a trace of passage. Being highly intelligent, one of these creatures will certainly escape by merging into the nearest earth or stone and burrow away when its hit points are at or below 50%.

**Combat:** Xorn can blend with stone, both in appearance and molecularly, and this enables them to take opponents unawares. They use their illusions and suggestions to surprise or otherwise catch an potential opponents off guard, particularly if those individuals carry any sort of gem, precious metal, or rare mineral, which xorn can smell at a range of 20 feet. They will demand to be given these materials to devour, and if this demand is not honored, a xorn is likely to attempt to take these materials by force. In combat, xorn use their claws and powerful bite to attack. If the fight goes poorly, a xorn may meld into stone by altering its molecular structure, and escape.

**Circular Vision:** A xorn cannot be back attacked, and it can detect creatures moving on all sides. However, it suffers a -4 penalty on all saves to resist the effects of gaze attacks.

**Earth Glide**: Xorn can glide through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth as easily as a fish swims through water. This movement leaves no tunnel or hole, nor does it create a ripple or other outward signature. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing xorn flings it back 30 feet, stunning it for 1 round unless the creature succeeds at a physical save. If phase door is cast on a xorn that is gliding through rock, it is slain instantly.

**Essence of Stone:** As creatures of elemental earth, xorn share qualities with the stone they live within and tunnel through. These qualities give them advantages, like a tough outer shell (armor class) and the ability to move through rock rapidly. However, any spell that can affect stone can have an effect on xorn. Spells such as move earth, transmute rock to mud, or stone to flesh will soften a xorn, causing it great pain and giving it an effective armor class of 15 for one round. Xorn cannot use their earth glide ability while suffering from these effects.

**Illusions/Suggestions: All aberrant elder xorn are able to generate illusion magic by concentration during a round. This includes “invisibility” to creatures around them. They are also capable of making suggestions of up to six words in length. Upon hearing the words, those within 30 feet distance, must make a successful


intelligence save or obey the suggestion (as the suggestion spell in the _C&C _Players _Haudbook_).

When an illusion generated by a xorn of this type is struck by anything that causes damage of 5 or more points to an actual living thing the fabric of the phantom image wavers and seems to collapse as if shrinking. A aberrant elder xorn not otherwise engaged has one round to re-establish the illusion, so as to make it seem it had simply managed to recover from the assault and be unharmed. Failing such intervention, the phantasmal thing vanishes at the close of the round after it was struck. Of course there is no trace of any “body” where the illusion was destroyed.

The wretch wight appears similar to the more common wight (_please refer to Mousters & Treasure_), but these creatures’ utterly black eyes seem to have red flames in place of irises. They reside in burial crypts and tombs, emerging only to pursue and consume the life force of their living prey.

**Combat**: Like their lesser cousins, the wretch wight engages an opponent to maim, hurt, and cripple. They delight in taking the life energy and possessions of their hapless victims, and in returning them to the same unlife as the wretch wight “enjoys”. They despise all living things and will attack with no provocation. They tear into their opponents with clawed fingers, rending flesh and bone as well as draining the very life from their victims.

**Energy Drain**: The foul touch of wretch wights causes the loss of the victims’ energy, this reflected by the loss of one experience level per touch. The draining imbues the wretch wight with power, increasing hit points by 1 per hit die, and when the maximum number of hit points (12) is reached they gain an additional overall hit die-with the new hit points total being averaged. For example, a wretch wight going from 60 Hit Points and 5 hit dice to 6 hit dice, the total hit points would remain the same overall, with the hit point average per die reducing to 10.

**Create **Spawn**: Any victim totally drained of energy thus becomes a wretch wight with the hit dice average indicated above, the new creature under the control of the wretch wight that slew it. The slaying wretch wight must want to use this ability; it is not automatic. A creature affected loses all abilities, and gains the statistics of a wretch wight. Spawn created in this way are only half strength; they have 3 hit dice, instead of 5, and lose the ability to create spawn, but are otherwise identical.

# Appendix H

## Optional Rules

The following section contains optional rules which the Castle Keeper should consider using in keeping with the original intent of the setting’s designer and the manner in which the current Castle Zagyg campaign is being played. All these options can be ignored, except for the dual classing rules. However, the latter rule can pertain only to non-player characters in this setting and not necessarily to the characters. Review the rules carefully and make a decision as to whether or not they are applicable to your game’s needs.

### Socio-Economic Class Standing for Characters

When beginning play in Yggsburgh, the Castle Keeper may want

to allow the characters to randomly generate their character’s socio-economic standing and, thereby, their starting wealth and possessions. The following is offered as a guideline.

To determine a character’s socio-economic background, roll a d10 and the number generated equals the socio-economic class rank or standing of the character’s family unless otherwise stated. A roll of 1 indicates the upper-upper tier, a 9 the lower-lower tier, and a 0 the underclass—a former vagabons, serf, or criminal (see chart below). This represents the character’s background though not necessarily their current status. For that, see the Character Class Social Standing chart below.

###### Background Class

D10	Social Class



1. middle lower class
1. upper lower class



1. upper middle class
1. lower upper class



###### Class and Level	Social Class

**Cleric, Bard, **Fighter, **Monk, **Ranger, **Druid**



7th - 12th	lower-upper class

13th - 18th	middle-upper class

###### Appendix H, Optional rules

###### Knight, Paladin



10th - 18th	middle-upper class

19th +	upper-upper class

###### Wizard, Illusionist



7th - 12th	lower-upper class,

13th - 18th	middle-upper class,



###### Thief, Assassin, Barbarian



7th - 9th	middle-lower class (middle criminal underclass)

10th - 12th	upper-lower class (lower-upper

criminal underclass)



19th +	upper-middle class

The character’s actual socio-economic standing is adjusted by the character’s class and level at any given time. Dual or multi-classed characters, use the average of all applicable rolls. As characters progress in class levels, their socio-economic standing increases as indicated on the chart above. Characters generally never move down in social standing except at Castle Keeper discretion and as a result of nefarious deeds or actions.

Within a demi-human society or communities there is no adjustment. In human societies other than that of the Underclass and Criminal Underclass, all demi-humans except elves are viewed as one socio-economic class lower than their human equivalent. This does not affect their initial funds (see below).

###### Player Character Initial Funds

The initial funds for characters beginning in Yggsburgh is based upon social standing or class ranking and not the character class. The following chart should be used to determine beginning money and some of the equipment for the character.



###### Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

1. 80gp and choice of horse, armor, up to 6 weapons
1. 70gp and choice of horse, armor, up to 5 weapons
1. 60gp and choice of horse, armor, up to 4 weapons
1. 50gp and choice of horse, armor, up to 3 weapons
1. 40gp and riding horse, chain mail, up to 2 weapons
1. 30gp and riding horse, chain mail, up to 2 weapons
1. 20gp and riding horse, studded armor, and 1 weapon
1. 15gp and leather armor, 2 non-sword weapons
1. 10gp and padded armor, 1 non-sword weapon

0	2gp and leather armor, 4 non-sword weapons

Assume that characters with a mount saddle and tack, including saddle bags. Other equipment desired by the character must be purchased with the starting money.

###### Player Characters Starting Above 1st Level

In order to reflect gains acquired from adventuring activity that must be assumed to have occurred in the process of gaining a level or levels above 1st, the Castle Keeper should adjust the resources of each character as follows:

The character gains 50gp per level plus 10% of starting money for each level above 1st level. For instance a 2nd level character in the 1st rank of socio-economic class adds 50gp for 2nd level and 200gp (10% of starting money x 1) to starting funds, while a 3rd level character of the 10th rank of socio-economic class adds 100gp for 3rd level and 10gp (10% of starting money x 2 for two levels above 1st) to starting funds.

Multi-classed or dual classed characters use the level of one class as a base for added starting money; then count the levels of a second or third class at half value when adding level bonus. For example a dwarf cleric/fighter of 4th/3rd level of the 7th socio- economic class rank would add 125gp (30% ) to starting money for being three levels above 1st, and then add for his combined levels above 1st, 150gp for cleric level (50gp x 3) and 50gp for fighter level (50 x 2 x .5).

###### Equipment for each Level above 1st

Assume that all ordinary equipment other than horses, armor, and swords have been acquired in the course of adventuring, so the player is free to list whatever is desired in this regard. If 3rd level or above, allow characters lacking choice of horse, armor and weapon to select one of each for personal use even if of the lowest socio-economic class.

### Arms and Armors

###### Wear and Tear

Weapons and armor can take a severe beating in combat. Armor may eventually simply cease to function in its original capacity and become useless as straps are shorn away, clasps become unworkable, rents, dents and holes make it less capable of deflecting weapons or absorbing impacts while more serious dents and holes make it simply unwearable. Likewise, weapons may break and do become duller over time, heads loosen from shafts and the effects of rust can take their toll. These rules reflect these occurrences.


It is contemplated that armor and shields suffer damage in relative proportion to that suffered by the individual possessing them. All armor has hit points that must be tracked as hit points for a character are. The grade the armor’s manufacture is important when making a purchase as that effects the amount of hit points that armor has. Additionally, salvaging armor from dead opponents is also a concern as it to may be destroyed or weakened. This added consideration means that Player Characters should have to have their armor and shields repaired from time to time, and that salvaged armor, shields, and weapons will not be worthwhile in many cases. Of course it also encourages the characters to seek out the best quality (Fine Grade) armor, shields, and weapons.

Armor’s hit points are determined by rolling a 1d6 multiplied by its armor class bonus (1+) and then multiplied by the quality of its of make (1-5). For example, a character purchases chainmail armor of superior quality. The player rolls a d6 (assume a 3), multiplies this by its bonus (+5) for a 15. This result is multiplied by its quality multiplier and for superior armors it is 3 giving a final hit point total of 45 for the chainmail.

Each hit point of damage received by the character is also applied to the armor. When the armor reaches zero hit points, its effectiveness is reduced and its modifier is reduced by one point. After this the process begins again with the armor taking twice the amount of damage as the character wearing it receives. Once its hit points are lost, its effectiveness is reduced by 2 points. At this point the process is repeated again but the armor takes damage at four time the rate the characters does. Once the armor reaches its hit point maximum, its modifier is reduced by 4 points. After this, the process is repeated but the armor takes damage at eight times the rate the character does. Once the armor reaches it hit point limit, its effectiveness is reduced by 8 points. The process continues like this with the reductions doubling each time. Once armor reaches +0 for its armor modification, it is considered destroyed.

When determining what degree of wear and tear any armor has, simply compare its original armor modification with its current armor modification. Divide the current modification by the original modification and the resulting percentage is the amount of wear and tear it has suffered.

Repair restores the loss, and the shield is always in need of repair too in such cases. Costs for this is given in the details of Yggsburgh Encounter 62. Elite Arms & Armor. Outside the town, you can assume that smiths can repair metal armor, leather workers restore that sort of armor, at costs in time and money equal to those indicated for the weapons shop’s.

Armor and shields come in four qualities of workmanship labeled 1-5 or poor to fine. Further, each quality category is associated with certain groups of people or creatures.



1. Superior armor/shields	Military-type
1. Fine armor/shields	Elite units



##### Weapons

Similar to armor, weapons may wear down. Like armor, weapons come in four categories of quality (see below). Thus before a combat takes place the Castle Keeper will need to establish the grade of armor and weapons being employed. As with armor, the category establishes purchase and repair cost (see Yggsburgh Encounter 62. Elite Arms & Armor).

There is a chance for weapon breakage on any attack roll with a natural 1. Depending on the quality of the weapon being used, breakage can occur. See the chart to determine if the weapon breaks.

###### Weapon Quality	Chance for Breaking



1. Superior	Roll d20 again, it breaks if the result is 1-5
1. Fine	Roll d20 again, it breaks if the result is 1

Magical Weapons are more difficult to break. For a magical weapon, two confirming d20 rolls of 1 give a chance for breaking. A third d20 is rolled with the following results:

###### Weapon Type	Breaks



Sturdy Metal	Breaks on a 1-2

### Notes on Dual-Class and Multi-Classing

It seems reasonable to this author that very able characters be able to operate in two distinct and not incompatible classes at the same time. Thus, a fair number of the non-player characters encountered in this setting have dual class status and it would be unfair not to present the players with the same options.

There are two options when a player decides his character should have more than one class. The first option is multi-classing. This allows a character to be made up of more than one class when initially created. The second option is dual classing. Dual-classing allows a character to acquire another class later on in their career.


Appendix H, Optional rules

##### Multi-classing

###### Choosing the Classes

1. Any class can combine with any other class barring alignment restrictions.
1. Up to three classes can be chosen for humans and two for demi-humans.
1. The classes chosen must correspond to a prime attribute.

###### Advancing Levels

1. All experience points are divided up equally amongst the classes chosen for the character. For example, if a fighter/ rogue were to receive 250 experience points, 125 is applied to the fighter class and 125 to the rogue class. All fractions are dropped.
1. Once a character acquires enough experience points to progress in one class, they do so. For example, a cleric/wizard has 2,252 experience points in both the wizard and cleric class (they must always be equal), that character advances to 2nd level cleric while remaining a 1st level wizard.
1. When advancing a level, use the Hit Dice type for the class one advanced in to determine the number hit points gained. Using the cleric wizard above, the player rolls a d8 for hit points. When the character acquires 2,602 experience points, a d4 is used for hit points.
1. The character level is the accumulated levels of all the classes. So a 4th/4th level rogue/fighter has 8 character levels. At the point the 11th character level is gained, hit point accumulation changes. At this point, hit point accumulation is equal to the advancement of the character’ classes at 10th level and beyond. For example, a 5th/5th fighter/rogue gains a level of rogue so gains +2 hit points, when that character gains a level of fighter, they gain +4 hit points.
###### Restrictions

1. Multi-classed characters take the best to hit bonus of their classes.
1. Multi-classed characters use the least restrictive weapons list for their classes.
1. Multi-classed characters use the most restrictive armor list of their classes.
1. Multi-classed characters can not combine abilities. For example, a fighter’s extra attack means that the character can make an extra normal attack and not use that extra attack to deflect missiles, make a back attack or inspire.
1. Starting gold is determined by rolling for each class individually, combining the results and dividing that by the number of classes the character has.

Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

### Dual-classing

Dual classing is similar to multi-classing only in that the character has several classes. The classes are acquired differently and progression is slightly different. In dual classing, the player’s character begins with one class and decides to change careers (so to speak) and add on a different class.

###### Acquiring Classes

1.1. The character must start with one class.
1.1. The character must progress at least one level in the starting class before adding an additional class to his character.
1.1. Barring alignment restrictions, any class can be added. Prime attributes do not restrict class choice. A character can have a maximum of three classes but before adding another class, the character must progress at least one level in the most recently added class.
1.1. Before adding the class and its abilities, the character must undergo training. Before taking the new class, he must earn double the number of experience points required for the new class to reach 2nd level. Only after this number of experience points have been earned does the character acquire those class abilities. Furthermore, the character must be working with another character or non-player character of the class to be added and they must be at least 3rd level. And finally, while in this period of training, they must obey all the restriction of being dual classed (see below). In this case, all abilities and checks associated with the new class are made at -5 and no magic can be used.

For example, a fighter decides to become a thief. After attaining 2nd level as a fighter, the player decides to add the rogue class to the character. He then must gain 3000 experience points in cross-over training before adding 1st level rogue to his character. Additionally, this 3000 experience points must be earned while the character is under the tutelage of a 3rd level or greater rogue. During this training period, the character can use rogue abilities (such as pick pockets) but does so at -5 to his check.

1.1. Once a level has been attained in the new class, the character can apportion experience points in any manner chosen. Thus, level advancement can be uneven.
1.1. When advancing a level, use the Hit Dice type for the class one advanced in to determine the number hit points gained. Using the fighter/rogue above, the player rolls a d6 for hit points when adding their new class.
1.1. The character level is the accumulated levels of all the classes. So a 4th/4th level rogue/fighter has 8 character levels. At the point the 11th character level is gained, hit point accumulation changes. At this point, hit point accumulation is equal to the advancement of the character’ classes at 10th level and beyond. For example, a 5th/5th fighter/rogue gains a level of rogue so gains +2 hit points, when that character gains a level of fighter, they gain +4 hit points.


###### Restrictions

1. Dual-classed characters take the best to hit bonus of their classes.
1. Dual-classed characters use the least restrictive weapons list for their classes.
1. Dual-classed characters use the most restrictive armor list of their classes.
1. Dual-classed characters can not combine abilities. For example, a fighter’s extra attack means that the character can make an extra normal attack and not use that extra attack to deflect missiles, make a back attack or inspire.

#### Secondary Skills

This section pertains to the acquisition and application of secondary skills for characters. Secondary skills are bundles of related skill sets that can be possessed by non-player characters and/or characters. These skill bundles represent a person’s ability to perform actions within the ability description with an expertise greater than those without. It is important to note that, when applying this system, the Castle Keeper must be aware that those attempting to perform actions that are covered by a secondary ability or class ability which they do not possess can not perform them as well as other characters or non-player characters. This allows the secondary abilities to have some meaning in the game. To take a modern example, would it be reasonable for someone lacking the training in corporate tax law to correctly fill out the requisite tax forms for a small corporation, much less a large one?

For example, the subborning skill includes the ability to bribe. Consider two characters, Aldous and Bensly, attempting to bribe a local magistrate. Aldous has the subborning skill and Bensley does not. Bribery is a charisma based skill. So both would make a charisma check to determine if they successfully bribe the officer of the law. Because Aldous has the subborning skill, he is allowed to add a bonus to his charisma check. This roll is modified by difficulty and other considerations the Castle Keeper may deem appropriate.

The following section describes what secondary skills are in general, how to acquire them, apply secondary skills in the game, adjust rolls, a description of the secondary skills and advice on expanding the list of secondary skills.

###### What are Secondary Skills

Secondary Skills are really bundles of skills, abilities and capabilities that reflect or incorporate certain sets of social skills, intellectual abilities or physical capacities. For example, bullying affects a character’s ability to grapple, intimidate, punch, and threaten opponents. As this example shows, secondary skills are a broad set of abilities that can be structured under one category. These are abilities or capacities a character has and, by possessing them, better able to perform them than those who do not possess them.

###### 244

###### Acquiring Secondary Skills

Secondary abilities are acquired by an expenditure of experience points. A character must expend experience points to gain these abilities. The experience points expended can not be used for class level advancement. The cost in experience points for skills depends upon the type and level of the skill.

Also, skills can be improved upon. The first acquisition of an ability means the character has a level one skill. The second acquisition of that skill indicates the character has a level two ability. These levels can increase as high as the character desires. Each skill level acquisition is considered separate for advancement purposes.

There are three classifications of abilities as pertains to cost: General Skill, Prime Skill and Non-Prime Skill.

General Skill: These abilities are open to all.

Prime Skill: This ability is prime specific and more easily learned by a character with that prime.

Non-Prime Skill: This refers to the acquisition of skills that are prime specific but which the character does not have a prime.

Each Skill has a base cost in experience points. The acquisition of thin that skill c0sts that amount. Thereafter cost is the base multiplied by the level one is attaining. For example, acquiring a level three prime skill costs 9,000 experience points. One can only go up a level one at time. One can not buy three levels in one fell swoop. Skill levels can only be gained after at least one class level is attained. For example, a 3rd level character can purchase a skill but can not purchase another skill or skill level until 4th level in the class is attained.

Ability Classification

Cost in Experience Points

Prime Skill

3,000

General

5,000

Non-Prime Skill

8,000

For example, a character acquires one prime specific skill at a cost of 3,000 experience points at 3rd level. The second such skill level then costs 3,000 x 2, for a 6,000 total, and if a third such skill level is acquired it will cost 9,000 experience points.

###### Secondary Skills

The following is a list of the secondary skills available in Castle Zagyg. We encourage the Castle Keeper and players to expand upon this list as necessary, modify it or even split the secondary skills up into more discrete units. The latter is discussed in ‘Using Secondary Skills.’

**Ambush **(dexterity **and **wisdom **- **prime/dexterity **) This ability allows for concealment (objects or person), hiding (in general) and trap construction.

The concealment and hiding act in the same manner as a thief’s hide ability. The traps work in the same manner as a ranger’s Traps ability. This skill also confers a +2 to all surprise checks. If thieve’s or rogue’s take this ability, they add an additional +2

###### Appendix H, Optional rules

to their Hide, Open Lock and Traps ability. If a ranger takes this ability, they gain an additional +2 to all Traps checks.

**Bullying (strength and charisma - general)** This skill set affects one’s ability to grapple, intimidate, punch, and threaten opponents.

If this ability is taken, it affects all grappling, overbearing and pummeling attacks by giving the attacker a +2 to hit per level of the skill. Further, intimidation and threats are non-violent methods of forcing an opponent to bend to one’s will. The character or non-player character acted upon (threatened or intimidated) must make a charisma saving throw to be unaffected. This saving throw is adjusted by -2 per ability level of the one initiating the act. If the saving throw is not successful, the effected person will essentially do as requested, refuse to fight or back down from a demand.

**Business (intelligence and wisdom - prime/intelligence)** This ability relates to one’s performance in accounting, banking, commerce, finance, investing, and trading (assures literacy and numeracy). As a practical matter, this ability allows a character to partake in and understand various business dealings, understand the complexities of taxing and licencing and, make better business deals for it. It also allows for the decipherment of contracts and an understanding of bookkeeping.

The Castle Keeper must use their best judgement in the use and application of this ability due to its broad range. However, in general, this allows for a character to have greater knowledge of business practices. As such, any character with this ability should be able to note when they are being offered a bad business deal, poor exchange rates and understanding of the complexities of taxing laws to name a few. When a character is presented with a situation in which a better business deal can be made or business laws might be broken they should be allowed to make either an intelligence check or wisdom check (depending on the circumstance) to determine if they know how to better execute their actions. Further, when making transactions or trying to ‘hoodwink’ others in business dealings, the recipient of the character’s action should make a saving throw at -2 to determine if the character’s proposals are accepted. In the latter case this would be when trying to exchange gems or jewelry or other items at inflated or deflated prices.

**Construction (intelligence and strength - general) This ability refers the capacity to build, do carpentry, engineering, build fortifications, masonry, mechanics and assures basic literacy and full numeracy.

This ability allows the character to perform and understand the nature of basic construction. Higher levels of this ability only increases this ability. This ability allows the character to design, build and oversee construction projects, spot shoddy work and make basic repairs to buildings or fortifications. The Castle Keeper must use their best judgement in the use and application of this ability. For example, if a character were looking over the designs for a castle, house or other structure, they might be able to

###### 245

Castles Zagyg: Yggsburgh

note (with an intelligence check) whether or not the plans have a flaw in them. In another case, the character may be working on a project and very well know how to put together scaffolding such that it is safe or build a complex doorway.

**Escape Ability (dexterity - general)** This ability allows for distraction, diversion, evasion and sprinting during combat.

Possession of this skill set confers a +2 to armor class if a successful dexterity attribute check is made. This modifier is in addition to all other modifiers that normally apply. This skill can not be used in conjunction with any other action with the following exceptions: dodge, disengaging from combat, evade and for a monk when they are deflecting missiles. One can not make an attack or cast spells in the round this is used nor use any other class ability Further, if disengaging from combat, a successful dexterity check indicates that a hasty withdrawal can be made without incurring the armor class penalty or the free swing from an opponent.

**Esoteric Ability (intelligence - prime/intelligence)** This skill references a character’s knowledge of ancient history, arcana, artifacts, fables, lost lore, mysteries, occult and relics. This also assures literacy and full numeracy.

This skill gives the character or non-player character a range of knowledge in many fields of study that other would not likely know. This ability allows the character an intelligence check to know or at least know where to go to learn abut a particular subject or issue related to the above mentioned subjects. It also increases the characters chances of locating items of intersts in antique shops, books in libraries or other related activities. In cases in which a character may know of or about a subject and specific knowledge is called for, an intelligence check should suffice to determine if the character knows it. As with all skills, the Castle Keeper needs to use their best judgement on when and how to apply this skill.

**Forgery **Ability **(dexterity **- **prime/dexterity) This ability affects a character’s ability to copy, counterfeit, draw duplicates and fake documents.

This is skill set is fairly restricted to acts of forgery whether deeds of ownership, heraldic symbols, coinage, papers of heritage and even antique paperwork. When used, the must make a successful dexterity check to adequately create a forged item. A failure indicated another attempt must be made. For those on the receiving end of the forged item, they must make an intelligence check at -2 per level of the forger’s secondary skill. If it is successful, they note the forgery.

**Military Leadership (charisma and intelligence - prime/ intelligence and charisma)** This ability allows for the control, direction, guidance, logistics, management, organization, planning, strategy and tactics in warfare. It also affects the capacity to organize or circumvent problems that might result from the management of an army.

This skill allows for the efficient planning and orchestration of the movement of large bodies of troops. For example, efficient


logistical chains are more easily managed and supplies made more available if one possess this skill. The Castle Keeper must their best judgement in the practical application of this skill as it will generally only come into play when the movement of large armies occurs. However, should a character be responsible for provisioning a party, it is likely that the possessor of this skill may not a deficiency. The Castle Keeper should inform the player of this if a successful wisdom check is made. Further, if a knight has this ability, his inspire ability is treated as two levels greater than the class level.

**Judgment Ability (intelligence and wisdom - prime/wisdom)** This ability allows the detecting of deception, evaluating worth, learning, logic, sophistry and assures literacy and numeracy.

Judgement covers a wide range of capacities. It can be used to detect lies another is telling, to interpret the meaning of another words, intent, desires and related emotions. Should this ever be necessary, the person possessing this skill must make wisdom check at +2 per level of this skill to detect a lie, the accuracy of another statement, intent etc. Further, judgement allows for the assessment of the accuracy of another’s statements. This is done by making an intelligence check at +2 per level of ability. This is, of course, presuming the character possessing the skill can even know the accuracy of that statement. For example, should a non-player character make a false claim about a kingdom which the character knows nothing of, there is little chance he would know the statement was false. However, the character could make a wsdom check to determine if the non-player character were dissimulating.

**Nautical Ability (dexterity, constitution and intelligence - general) This skill set gives the possessor superior knowledge of boating, ship command, diving, fishing (deep and fresh water), navigating, sailing, and swimming.

This skill set references abroad range of nautical skills. Should the situation ever arise in which knowledge of the sea, river or lake come to be needed, the character with this skill should minimally have an idea or answers to concerns or issues. Characters with this skill can swim better than others, navigate by the stars or sun, fish and supply food as a ranger, maneuver boats and sail many a sea going craft. All checks used that relate to this skill receive a

+2 to the roll. Examples might include intelligence checks for navigating, constitution checks for deep sea diving and dexterity checks for maintaining control of a rudder in a storm.

**Suborning Ability (charisma and intelligence - prime/charisma)** This skill set relates blackmail, bribery, convincing, diplomacy, ingratiation, influence and lying.

This is a social skill that allows the character to more effectively carry out any of the above actions as he or she knows the specialized languages, body motions, traditions and cultures of those he is dealing with. For example, bribing a city official is a delicate task and requires not a small amount of tact. Blackmail may require some specific piece of knowledge or knowledge of how to acquire that information with which the character intends to

###### 246

bribe a non-player character. In all cases, the possessor of this skill is allowed to make a charisma or intelligence (as appropriate and determined by the Castle Keeper) to determine if one is successful at performing it. A failed check indicates the attempt at bribery failed or diplomacy failed. The character receives a +2 for each level of skill they possess.

**Swindling **Ability **(charisma **and **intelligence **- **prime/charisma)** This skill refers to the capacity to cheat, deceive, fix (as in contests), fraud, gamble, odds (establishing) and promote events (assuring numeracy).

This skill allows the character to perform many tasks related to the swindling others out of their money from cheating at cards, running pyramid schemes, fixing wrestling matches and running the odds on dice games. Whenever a character employs this skill they receive a +2 to their checks per level of experience in the skill. For example, should a character with this skill attempt to cheat at cards, they make an intelligence check and if they succeed, they have succeeded in cheating the opposing players. Of course, using the judgement skill, another character can attempt to dissever this deception by making a successful intelligence or wisdom check.

**Thespianism (charisma - general)** This ability refers to acting, disguise (makeup), impersonation, mimicry, orating, performing, reciting, singing (assures literacy).

This ability indicates a characters capacity to carry off performance acts to entertain a crowd or, in its most unusual circumstance, impersonate another. The ability works as the illusionist’s Disguise. It can also be used to entertain people. How well the performance works. The character makes a charisma check at +2 per skill level and if successful, the audience receives the acting well, if not, boo’s and rotten tomatoes may follow. This check is adjusted by an audience (or individual members) expectations and knowledge.

**Woodsman (wisdom) This skill refers to boating (small), climbing, fishing, hunting, identification (fauna and flora), lumberjacking, survival, tracking and trapping.

Acquisition of this ability replicates the Survival and Track abilities of a ranger. Should a ranger take this ability, they receive and additional +2 to all Track checks per level of this skill and an additional +2 to all die rolls for the Survival ability.

###### Using Secondary Skill

The use of secondary skills in a game will take a creative Castle Keeper. While some of the skills are straightforward, others are not or involve such general concepts as to make specific explanation on when and how to apply them in their myriad forms, meaningless. That said, some explanation must be give.

First, to resolve an issue that involves any of the skills mentioned above does not require a skill check. Often times success is guarantied or the Castle Keeper knows what the outcome wold be. In other cases the Castle Keeper might want to propel the story along some interesting path and allow for it success. Only in those

###### Appendix H, Optional rules

cases in which a chance of failure looms large should a skill check be made. Or, that is those involving combat. Once it is decided that a chance of failure is possible, then a check must be made.

To make the check, the character acting (such as doing research) simply rolls an appropriate attribute check and add +2 per skill level of experience. So if a character has 3 levels of skill experience in Thespianism, they are allowed a +6 to their roll. Also, this roll is adjusted by any appropriate attribute modifiers. It is important to note that the roll IS NOT adjusted by the character’s class level.

In some instances the use of a skills causes another to make a saving throw. In this case, the character, monster or non-player character makes a saving throw but modifies the roll by a -2 for each level of skill experience the character has. This is further adjusted for any attribute modifiers. When a saving throw is called for, the character’s level or monsters hit dice do affect the roll.

Further, there are always circumstances than need some modification beyond that mentioned above. Unusual circumstances, the weather and pure chance can come into play and effect the chances of success. Also, the difficulty of the situation adjusts the roll. The following is offered as a guideline for deciding these modifications.

Most rudimentary	- 8

Very easy, simple	-6

Often done, routine	-4

Usual / known	-2

Normal demand	0

Somewhat unusual application	+1 Complex /complicated	+3

Demanding / difficult	+5

Very demanding	+7

Extremely difficult	+9

Nearly impossible	+11

#### Awarding Experience Points

The Castle Keeper is completely free to award Experience Points in whatever manner is desired. The following suggestions might be helpful in making campaign activity.

1. For active participation in game sessions: 20 to 50xps per hour.
1. Normal XPs for each creature (monster) slain divided amongst participants engaged in the combat, division by effective fighter level, viz. fighters get 1 share per level, thieves get 1 per two levels, clerics 1 per three levels, mages get one per four levels.
1. One-half normal xps for each adversarial creature (monster) duped, captured, or driven away.
1. For all fighter-type characters (fighters, barbarians, knights, rangers) meaningful use of a weapon against an adversary: 10xps per character level of the fighter per battle.
1. For spell-caster characters successful and meaningful use of a spell: 100xps per spell level, 25 per 0 level casting.
1. For ranger characters successful and meaningful use of a listed function: 20xps per character level of the
1. For thief (or assassin) characters successful and meaningful use of a listed function: 20 xps per character level of the thief.
1. For monetary value of treasure gained; thieves get 1 xp for every 5sp found and all others get 1xp for every 1gp found.

## Afterward

The author once again gives thanks to John R. Troy for several encounters contained herein. As usual, the stalwart “JRT” was free with comments, criticisms, and creative contributions. I keep encouraging John to write a work of his own, but he is reluctant, preferring, I suppose, to assist in smaller ways on many projects of mine and other authors too. So here is yet another acknowledgment of John’s efforts.

The following are the initial play-tester for this work: Brad Burklow, Jeff Burklow, Alex Gygax, Bill Johnson, John Seibel, Tony Merlock.

Valuable map assistance was also lent to me by Jeff Burklow, Bill Johnson, and John Seibel…thanks fellows!
