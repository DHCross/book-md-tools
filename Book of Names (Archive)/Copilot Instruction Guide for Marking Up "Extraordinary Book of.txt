# Copilot Instruction Guide for Marking Up "Extraordinary Book of Names"

**Purpose:**
Add structural header markers to the Markdown version of the book so it can be automatically styled and parsed by layout software like InDesign. Maintain tab-delimited formatting for tables and do not interfere with list content.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Insert the following plain-text tags **at the beginning of the line** for any headings in the Markdown document:

| Markdown Heading | Tag to Insert | Purpose                         |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `# `             | `<ch>`        | Chapter Title                   |
| `## `            | `<1>`         | Section Header (1st level)      |
| `### `           | `<2>`         | Subsection Header (2nd level)   |
| `#### `          | `<3>`         | Sub-subsection (rare; optional) |

Do **not** alter any lines that:

* Are part of tab-delimited tables
* Begin with a tab (`\t`) or contain multiple tabs (these are tables)
* Contain comma-separated lists or examples
* Are part of a table of contents or internal list

---

## ✅ Transformation Examples

Before:

```markdown
# Introduction
## How to use the book
### A nominal history
```

After:

```markdown
<ch> Introduction
<1> How to use the book
<2> A nominal history
```

---

## 🔍 Identification Tips

Use the structure of the Markdown file:

* `# ` = top-level headings (likely match actual chapter titles)
* `## ` = logical subheadings
* `### ` = detail-level divisions

Use the presence of leading tabs (`\t`) as a red flag to **avoid editing** — those are tables and must remain untouched.

---

## 🛑 DO NOT TOUCH:

* Lists of names or items with tabs or commas
* Anything inside actual tables (they are tab-delimited)
* Literal backslashes like `\t` or `\n` (means bad formatting — warn the user if found)

---

## ⚙️ Scope of Edit

Work on the entire Markdown file, but restrict transformations to lines with heading markers. Leave all other content as-is.

---

## ✍️ Post-Processing Notes

Once the header markers have been applied:

* Save the edited file as `Extraordinary Book of Names (Tagged).md`
* It can then be previewed, converted to Word, or used for layout parsing

## 📎 Reference

Also consult the human-written formatting guide in the same folder titled:

> `InDesign Table Prep & Workflow Note`

It describes the reasons behind tab/return formatting and layout behavior in InDesign.

Copilot, your task is to insert structural clarity while preserving data fidelity. Think like a typesetter, edit like a programmer.

Good luck.
